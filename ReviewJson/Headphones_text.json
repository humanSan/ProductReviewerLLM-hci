{"review":"My late headphones set the standard by which I judge all others. With a pair of titanium drivers, they had the best frequency response of any set of headphones I have ever used. There were two problems: they were open, and the cord was extremely thin and prone to breaking.\n\nEnter the ATH-M30. With a thick cord entering on only one side and nearly impervious to wear and tear, closed ears eliminating much external noise, thick and soft padding that makes long duration listening comfortable, a padded head band, (everywhere that directly touches the head is padded... some serious points there) and constructed of hard plastic and metal that bends and doesn't break. And of course sound quality and frequency response... the specs say 20Hz - 20 KHz, and while I haven't tested the high end, the low end is beautiful and strong. If you watch a movie with these and a plane flies overhead, you are not alone if you take the headphones off to make sure one didn't really fly overhead. Great signal-to-noise ratio and frequency response that makes the inadequacies of MP3s immediately apparent. If there were a similar pair of headphones that had titanium drivers, there would be a slight quality increase, but it's great as it is.\n\nSound quality 4.5 (5 being with titanium drivers)\nSignal-to-noise 5\nConstruction 5\nComfort 4.5\nRange\/Frequency response 4.5\nDurability 5"}
{"review":"I've been on a quest for a variety of headphones for tracking use in my little den of a self-proclaimed studio, now that my Panasonic HT450 cans are mostly ageing.\nThe ATH-M30 is the lower-cost Audio-Technica pro headphone. I ended up buying PRO-6, and wanted to review those, but they don't seem to be available around here. I tried the ATH-M30 on at the shop and recall being quite impressed, especially for the price!\nSurprisingly, even these budget headsets deliver a tight mid-rangey punch that can help cut through a loud tracking room environment - no, they're not as hi-fi, but I think they help to hear clearer in certain situations. Plus the ear cups don't swivel all around or fold up like the 40 Series or the Panasonics, so the cans are easier to put on.\nThe cable does have a 1\/8\" end with a screw-on adapter, which I would chop off and replace with a 1\/4\" plug instead. These phones retail for less than $100, which makes it easy to pick up a couple for a small studio.\nBrilliant stuff. Worth a go if you are looking for something decent that doesn't cost a bomb."}
{"review":"Finding a pair of decent-sounding closed headphones at less than 50USD is far to be easy. The typical sound of those is boomy, with strange reverberation effects and a poor sound. The ATH-M30 provide a warm sound, with a solid bass (sometimes a bit undefined), a smooth midrange and a correct trebble. The feeling is perhaps not the \"outstanding clarity\" advertised but rather a relaxing sound, with a good balance between details and fun. Compared to the sennheiser HD212, the trebble is a bit lacking but, at least, the bass doesn't kill the midrange.\nThese headphones are well-built and will probably last. I only regret the absence of a collapsable capacity."}
{"review":"I've had these headphones for over two years now, using it every week day, and it's still working perfectly. I especially love the long cables and comfortable ear pads that allow me to have it on all day while i'm working. I use it about 6-8 hrs a day every week day and i rarely get that ear sore that some other head phones have caused in the past.\n\nThe sound is also very clear and crisp. Overall I am very happy with these."}
{"review":"The cord is long, which is either a pro or a con depending on what you want. I simply coiled it in a manner that still looks nice but shortens it to something a little more normal. Good sound, can ignore a lot of idiots when plugged in."}
{"review":"Great sound. Not sound canceling, which I didn't expect, but would have been nice anyway. Only downfall is the massively long cord is easy to get caught, and the audiojack broke off."}
{"review":"like A lot to like about this headset. Mostly blocks out other sounds. Very good quality audio and cables. However, it started falling apart after only 2+ years :-( The material used for the top and the ears are peeling off one strand at a time :-( It's very irritating to the ears now. Not sure if quality control was purposefully allowing lower grade materials to be used for this Audio-Technica headset or if it was a manufacturer's defect that is replaceable? Sad to lower rating down to 2 stars, but my last headsets lasted many more years than this one! Noticed vendors are now trying to charge $100 for this, but after being much older product, would have expected price to have dropped, rather than gone up by 2 1\/2 times!????"}
{"review":"Audio is great. Fit is good and comfortable. Problem?  The location where the cord enters the headphones makes a squeak noise whenever you move around. So, if I sit perfectly still, I am fine. If I move (which, um, I do) then I hear this horrible noise in the background.  I finally couldn't handle it any longer and they're gonna bite the dust."}
{"review":"I purchased these about 3 years ago. I'm no audiophile but these sound great and they're cheap compared to other headphones with good sound quality.\n\nHowever, one major complaint is that they hurt my ears after a couple hours of use. Comfort was not a factor I had heavily considered when making this purchase and, in hindisight I think I should have given it more priority in my decision. I kind of wish I had maybe saved up for the Seinheisser HD 598s which are known for their comfort. However, those are 3-4 times the price of these (~$150), so it's not really a fair comparison. Still, it might have been worth it."}
{"review":"I bought these from a guitar center about seven years ago and they broke yesterday. The 3.5mm connector snapped in half. I did have to replace the ear muffs after they wore out once but the headphones always sounded great. This brand of headphones has lasted longer than any other brand that I have owned. I've stepped on them and yanked the chord numerous times and they have withstood the abuse. I now own the M30x and M50. I really like this brand a lot and wanted to share my experience with people. I hope this helps."}
{"review":"The black plastic covering on the ear pieces started crumbling off , I don't know if there is such a thing as leather covers, for I'm afraid my new ones may someday do the same.  Also,  the plastic cover for the batteries  broke and we had to tape across the batteries.  The  sound was fine."}
{"review":"They sound great, but they creak an awful lot. I've tried adjusting them, but the slightest movement will make them click and clank like popcorn in a metal pot. It's a shame; they'd be great headphones if it wasn't for that continuous creaking."}
{"review":"They are such good headphones for a good price. I had mine for years. Comfy, great sound quality. Of course not \"pro\" for music professionals in the studio, but at home, with the sound system of computer games or for watching movies: Really great."}
{"review":"Sound quality is fantastic for the price. Still working perfectly after all these years. I use them at work, and I can just flip one of the cups around if a coworker comes by and wants my attention, but doesn't deserve ALL my attention. jk love you guys <3\n\nOnly negative is that the cable is REALLY long. Really, really long. You may want to get a tie for it."}
{"review":"I've had mine for about 3 years now. Great pair of headphones for the price. The frequency response is kind of wild, but the sound is pretty enjoyable. One thing I don't like about them is that they start to make my ears hurt after wearing them for a while. They're sturdy and reliable. I'd highly recommend these for tracking, recording, or daily listening use if you don't want to spend a fortune on higher end models."}
{"review":"I bought this item MANY years ago when I was still in college. It has probably been 4-5 years by now. These have held up GREAT and still sound AMAZING! For the price these will get you some great sound quality. Bass is clean and I can hear details I never heard with other headphones. The cushions have lost that thin outer layer but they are not falling apart at all. They are still comfortable to wear and no pieces of the cushions ever come off. I didn't even notice that they had worn away until I looked right now during this review. The cushion across the top is cracking off in a couple of places now but it is still 100% as \"cushiony\" as when I bought these many years ago.\n\nHighly recommended from this DAILY headphone user. These have been put through a lot with me. Still holding up great and probably will for years to come!"}
{"review":"Comparison Test - Much simpler and lighter build as compared to Sony MDR-7506 with some differences the Audio Technica ATH-M30 not having the folding mechanism as the Sony ( similar look ATH-M35 - version is collapsible ) also it does not have any numerical indentation with the metal sliders like the Sony. I have changed and installed aftermarket genuine sheep skin ear pads to both headphones so comfort factor has greatly improved without any changes to their sound signatures whatsoever., caliper pressure ( clamping force ) is nearly identical. It's in the sound department that you can clearly sense a difference with both - first thing you'll notice\/sense with the ATH-M30 is that it's more warmer sounding and has a bit more depth\/sound stage as compared to the Sony and as a consequence slightly less detail, also the bass isn't as punchy\/vibrant as the Sony but still very good overall. Good mids and high frequencies. Just an additional do think the ATH-M30 even sounds better and more comfortable to wear than it's newer-bigger brother ( M50\/M50X - I own an M50 so can attest to that )."}
{"review":"I really really love the sound on these headphones, but the black coating covering the foam ear pads has completely disintegrated and everytime I wear them I get covered in black specks. I cant wear them anywhere except around the house, and that defeats the purpose of why I bought them."}
{"review":"Good price, good audio quality, sturdy connector. After 4 years, the vinyl (?) on the ear pads has started decomposing and falling off in little chunks. I guess I can't complain too much, but if this stuff is going to fall off I'd rather they didn't put it on in the first place."}
{"review":"I give this product a five star because it held up really well over the 3 years that my son has been using it. It still works, which is a surprise because most headphones under 100 dollars usually don't last more than a year.\n1. It is really comfortable for a a cheaper pair of headphones.\n2. It still plays music and has been in use for about 30 minutes a day which is really impressive because for a 20 dollar pair they wouldn't work after a year, these lasted there years of heavy use.\n3. It sounds like you are in a movie theater and has good quality sound ability unlike some other headphones that might sound a little fuzzy."}
{"review":"If you are looking to step up your game and start hearing music the way it was meant to be heard, these headphones are a great place to start.\n\nI have had mine for at least 3 years, and these things just don't die. The cable is strong and thick, the jack on the end is solid and heavy, and the overall construction of these headphones is marvelous.\n\nGet yourself some lossless audio, find a nice bit-accurate media player for your device of choice, get yourself a usb DAC, lay down in a dark, quite room, and let the music you hear change your world.\n\n... or just listen to .mp3s, I'm not going to judge you.\n\nI am not super hearsed in audiophile lingo and you may not be either, so I would describe the sound quality these have as \"honest.\" If you're used to cheaper headphones, the bass sound from these may underwhelm you, as you may not be used to hearing it at the level it was meant to be heard. The overall sound is spacious and clear with a full and organic sound that suits any kind of music. Just keep in mind that all headphones need to be broken-in before they can reveal their full potential.\n\nOverall, great headphones for those who are sick of sub-par and overpriced brands, 10\/10 would open on christmas again."}
{"review":"Bought 3 years ago for husband for school. Work excellent!!! No problems and they are great to boa I out other sounds while he's working on editing videos. Would buy again"}
{"review":"I have owned a few cheap headphones before in the $5 to $15 range and they break within a few weeks. I search hi and low and read many reviews before buying this one. It works well, the bass and treble sounds are great. These are mid to high end with out breaking the bank. I don't know if they are great for mixing professionally but for home studio usage they work just fine."}
{"review":"I've had these for 5 years now (yes, I'm only just writing this review now half a decade later), and I can safely say they're the best, most durable pair of headphones I've ever owned. No problems with the sound or wiring or anything, even after 5 years of regular use. Do yourself a favour and get 'em."}
{"review":"I ordered these and did not receive the older version pictured. Received the new and IMPROVED version. Complete crap, bulky, heavy garbage, super uncomfortable. Slow shipping from seller. Completely disappointed, thank goodness my son liked them otherwise these would have went straight back or into the trash. I can't wear these for hours on end. Way to go Audio-Technica ruined a great product!!!"}
{"review":"I accidentally broke my ATH-M30 one week ago after 3 years. Writing this review before I'm about to order the replacement.\nThis was the best headphones I've had in my life. Cheap, high quality sound, and incredible long cord."}
{"review":"Solid sound and great value. My only complaint is that my ears will start to hurt if I wear these for more than 3 hours. I think that probably has less to do with these specific headphones and more to with the style of headphone where they rest on your ears."}
{"review":"Sigh. O my M30s, how I loved thee.\n\nAnyways, so long story short I bought these headphones two years ago. They were amazing, but just last week they broke. A product of this caliber should last at least half a decade."}
{"review":"As per my title.\n\nThese headphones are simply awesome.  Probably the best deal I've ever had for headphones.\n\nThe cord is ultra-long, allowing me to plug in and wander my room or office, without having to worry about popping out or suddenly going to speakers.\n\nThe can are comfortable and don't USUALLY cause issues.  I notice that when I am wearing my glasses, they do tend to cause a little ear fatigue, right at the tip of my ears.  Darn!\n\nGreat sound, great comfort across the board.  I've had these for a few years, and they still work great after several hundred...thousand?... hours of usage."}
{"review":"When I went to plug it into my computer it would not work. It works on my phone and my other devices, but it will not work with my computer jack--a functional jack."}
{"review":"Frankly, I had high hopes for these, and the sound they produce is in fact pretty good. Reviews are generally very solid here and on Gizmodo.\n\nHowever, they have the rather upsetting tendency to creak when I move. The pivots are pretty cheap plastic, and they make rather a lot of noise any time I make the smallest movement. If I am listening to Black Flag at full volume, this is not quite as noticeable, but I find it grating on my nerves most of the time. Wrapping small plastic-coated wire ties around the pivots helps, but it doesn't make the problem go away, and it looks janky as heck. Definitely disappointing."}
{"review":"I may look like I am sitting in the doctors office doing a hearing screening when I'm wearing these headphones, but let me tell you, the sound quality is out of this world. Would recommend these to anyone."}
{"review":"These are great headphones for the money. I use for recording vocals and producing music via a midi keyboard. Sound quality is great, build quality is above average."}
{"review":"Yeah. Basically what all the other reviewers said. Great legit headphones that look more expensive then they actually are. Get them for all your extended relatives and they'll think you're the cool aunt\/uncle\/brother\/sister etc. The cable is long as forever because these can be used as professional headphones. UNLESS YOU NEED A LONG CABLE, GET THE COILED VERSION. I repeat. GET THE COIL VERSION IF YOU DO NOT NEED  A LONG CABLE."}
{"review":"Great sounding headphones, or should I say \"realistic-sounding\"? The sound they produce is very transparent, without the bassy coloring that many similar options bring.\n\nThe cushion, however, will crumble away within 2 or 3 years and there's nothing you can do about it."}
{"review":"I bought these headphones in June of 2013, and almost three years later the left ear cup finally stopped working. The right still sounds as good as the day I bought them. I didn't baby them wear wise, and they dealt with it all well. I know I would recommend them. I very rarely felt uncomfortable wearing them, and it was nice to have a long cord. There was some tangling issues, and the plastic around where the cord met the ear cup broke down over time. I'm so glad these held up so well, definitely shows that spending a little extra money upfront will give you a better longer lasting product. I'm definitely going to be buying another set of Audio-Technica's."}
{"review":"Can't beat the price for sound quality and nice length studio cable for movement and even jamming. As I said, u won't find a better price for the quality. Only thing better would be to have leather cushions for the ears. You get a lot of sound for what you're paying..."}
{"review":"Great sound for the price. They're kind of uncomfortable on my head if I wear them too long. Wire is good and thick and should not break. These have lasted quite a long time and are still working great."}
{"review":"I use these to listen to streaming music or podcasts at night and also to practice guitar when I don't want to wake the kids.  They are pretty nice.  The chord is very long, which isn't so great for listening to streaming - I have to loop the chord around my neck if I'm going to walk around the house.  It's great for practicing guitar though because I have plenty of room to move if I get really into it."}
{"review":"This review is done after having this headphone set for over 2 year's... first, the quality of the sound on this product is very good, maybe not the kind you get from a professional studio headset but certainly really good quality. The materials are of a decent quality for the price, the padding on the ear is covered with a vinyl material that after a year of regular use broke apart, now it has only a black foam which is good because that's the part protecting the ears. The cord is long and reinforced in  both ends, something good because there's where a lot of headphones usually fail. The only part is not that good, is the one that connects the headphones with the headband, is made out a rigid black plastic that could break under some circumstances (my lady stepped on it and got them broke), I guess if owner take good care it may last a decent long time. Overall, for me it gets 5 stars considering the quality-durability-price ratio, of course you can get headphones of better quality but for an item under 45 dlls. is simple as good as it gets!"}
{"review":"These sound amazing for the price. I'm still using these. Bought them March 2014 and still going strong. I'll upgrade eventually, but there's no rush when I have these."}
{"review":"I bought these used and had no idea how good they actually sounded. I was amazed. Had never heard of the brand and had no expectations. I came here out of curiosity to see if it was just me. Clear, beautiful sounds. Music never sounded so good. I have used on iPod touch and laptop. Now I'm spoiled!"}
{"review":"Without any overly technical points these headphones provide excellent sound quality at a fraction of the cost of some more heavily advertised headphones on the market.  Audio-Technica makes a solid product that fits comfortably over my ears without being too cumbersome.  If I have the option its the only way that I listen to music or even movies\/TV episodes when by myself.  Highly recommend!"}
{"review":"I use these headphones for all of my studio work. I need to hear everything that gets picked-up by the microphones and these have yet to fail me. They are also handy for when I am gaming since the sound is great and they fit comfortably."}
{"review":"Bought these in 2013, and they just kicked the bucket on me this year. They were a great deal and endured alot of abuse. Great sound quality. I have already ordered another pair and plan to keep those another 3 years."}
{"review":"These are amazing headphones!! Out of all the headphones I've ever owned, these were the best. The sound on them is simply amazing for its price.\nI do a lot of audio editing and they were comfortable for wearing for long periods of times. The cord is super long, which I thought was a benefit at first but, it unfortunately got stuck under my chair and ended up ruining the cord leaving me unable to use them anymore. Besides my own fault, I really enjoyed these headphones. Would definitely buy another pair in the future."}
{"review":"Great sound quality and isolation. Sound leakage is minimal. The only real problem I have had with these headphones after three years of use is that I can't listen for extended amounts of time without my ears starting to hurt. Very sturdy design and thick cord can handle being thrown around a bit, but the cord is not replaceable. Overall good for its price range."}
{"review":"Items arrived on time. Packing was adequate. Item was as described and a little more than I expected them to be. I am happy with the purchase."}
{"review":"I love these headphones! Can hear other instruments when listening get to other music and they block outside interference a little. Had these for over a year now and they still work great. But beware, the chord is very long and is not detachable. But not a bad thing for me..."}
{"review":"I've had these as my sole pair of headphones for three years. I'm not an audiophile, so I can't comment especially on the sound quality, but I may do a comparison when I get a new pair.\n\nSound: 3.5 \/ 5\nThese won't blow anyone away, but they can handle loud volumes. Unfortunately, there's pretty significant sound leakage, which can be distracting to others in a quiet environment.\n\nDurability: 4.5 \/ 5\nThese things are tanks. They have a flexible metal band which prevents them from snapping and there's a coil around the headphone cable to reduce wear. The headphones themselves are still in excellent condition after 3 years of moderate - heavy use, although the earpads began to flake roughly 8 months ago, leaving pieces of black material everywhere. Most of it has now rubbed off, so it's not much of a problem anymore.\n\nComfort: 3 \/ 5\nAlthough they fit my head securely, they do make my ears sore after moderate use (~2 hours).\n\nAll in all, these are an excellent set of headphones around a $40 - $50 price point. Aside from the earpads, if you treat them even moderately well I'd expect them to last 4 - 5 years easily. If you can't get them on sale in that range, there's a good chance you'll be able to find something better elsewhere, but these are still a safe bet,"}
{"review":"so comfy! i love the extra long wire it comes with and the padding around the ears. i've taken these with me literally across the world and have even fallen asleep with them on. they're just so cushy! sound is great, too. they are a little bulky, but i already knew that when i bought them."}
{"review":"Great headphones!!  They work really well, and cover my ear completely, which was very important because most headphones make my ears hurt, but these don't, I can wear them for hours.  They do not cancel out all noise, just about 60%, and the sound quality is very good, it also has a good bass without it being overpowering.  The cord is very long and sturdy and the headphones have held up really well, no tearing or anything.  I'm not a sound technician or anything, but I really like these."}
{"review":"The headphones are of great quality. The sound is very good on the highs and lows. The cable is very long. They are made very well.\n\nThe only downside is that they are not comfortable on the ears. My wife and I each own these and we can only wear them for about an hour at a time."}
{"review":"These headphones are really great quality. I had to buy a pair of over-the-ear headphones for my production class, and these are perfect. They were a bit more expensive than I was hoping for, but after a lot of research, I realized I wasn't going to get quality headphones for less than $50.\n\nThese headphones aren't entirely noise-cancelling, but the quality of the sound is spectacular, and they do cancel out quite a bit of background noise. I had to use these when recording interviews or when editing, and the sound was really clear. They also have an extra long cord, so when I'm on set filming, I'm not attached at the hip to my equipment. I have the option to move around quite a bit.\n\nIf you're looking for quality headphones (whether for film\/music editing or otherwise), these are a great investment."}
{"review":"These sound truly amazing.  My kids are fighting to use it on their ipads so I will have to order another.  Very pleased.  Why pay more for the popular name brands?"}
{"review":"extreme sound quality for a $30 headset. sounds like a much more expensive set of headphones. this was bought on sale. the build quality is passable, but yields under constant, or aggressive use*\n\n*that one person in the family who always has to be the one with headphones, earphones, and other miscellaneous electronics spontaneously die more than anyone else due to how they use them."}
{"review":"I've had these going 4 years now and they still work great. Used primarily for tracking while recording bass covers and then during mixing. The extremely long cable is sometimes a bother but has withstood a fair bit of tugging. Used occasionally for listening to music and they are respectable and comfortable enough for my taste. I doubt there is a better pair of headphones available under $100. Will definitely stick with Audio Technica  if\/when these eventually stop working."}
{"review":"Im somewhat of a headphones snob, so when I say a pair is really amazing then it is. These are comfortable and flexible for durability. The sound quality is great. They don't have that crackling sound a lot of headphones make. The sound is clear. I have terrible hearing, so I usually have to turn the volume up all the way but with these I had to turn it down."}
{"review":"Bought this and the Sennheiser HD 202.\n\nWhile the quality of build of this one is better than the HD 202, the sound quality in my opinion as compared to the HD 202 does not justify the price difference of 4x the cost of the HD 202."}
{"review":"There are those rapper and producer endorsed headphones that look great, have an amazing marketing strategy that sound ok but are a bit high in price...\n\nThen there the Audio-Technica ATH-M30 that look and feel simpler, don't enjoy from a lot of product placement with artists and such BUT simply sound amazing for the price--and most of the time even better than sets priced almost twice the amount of these.\n\nTry them, compared them with anything in their price range (and out of it) and see what you've been missing out on."}
{"review":"Sound quality is decent for the price but anyone who is not 65+ years of age will need an amplifier because the loudness is not this headphones best quality whatsoever."}
{"review":"As of this writing I am 36 yrs old. I have owned various pairs of headphones throughout my life, I can remember even at the age of 14 yrs. old owning earphones for my walkman, I've been through at least 100 pairs of headphones over the many years, including for cd players in my early 20s and later for a computer, headphones have lasted me anywhere from a few months to a maximum of 1 yr. Yet I have owned the Audio Technica ATH-M30  headphones since 2005 which is a total of 10 yrs. and have had zero problems, none of this one side shorting out on the earphone, they work as good today September 18th 2015 as they did when I bought them in 2005.  And yes to me it is shocking that there are actually a pair of headphones out their that actually last !"}
{"review":"These headphones are fantastic! I've had them for about 2 years now and they still work great. I got these on sale for just under $40 and, for the price, I couldn't be happier. I actually bought these as part 1 of 2 to replace a broken PC Headset. I paired them with a Zalman clip-on Mic and the sound quality is head and shoulders above any headset I've used. I would definitely recommend these, especially if you can find them on sale."}
{"review":"Excellent range of sound. You might have to turn up the volume a bit higher to drown out background noise (depending on your environment), but these will do the trick."}
{"review":"Great headphones. Kind of uncomfortable, but they fit Brainwavs memory foam earpads. With a pair of memory foam earpads these become some amazing sounding comfortable headphones."}
{"review":"I've used these headphones for 3 years. My main complaint is that they squeeze my head too tightly and hurt my head\/ears when I wear them 30+ minutes. I tried increasing the cushioning but that didn't help. My only other complaint is the film on the cushioning has deteriorated, and leaves small bits of black film whenever I wear them."}
{"review":"Cool headphones. I used these only at home when my wife is asleep. It has a long cord which is why I bought it. All I hear are the sounds and music coming from these headphones."}
{"review":"I bought these to use with my electronic drum set and am blown away with the sound quality. Perfect for practicing as well as listening to music. Excellent bass and treble without overdoing either."}
{"review":"Fantastic pair of headphones. I was looking for a good set of headphones for gaming and jumped on these while they were on sale.  Audio-Technica as a brand makes some pretty high quality stuff. The ATH-M30 is on the lower end of their headphone line, but still sounds fantastic.\n\nThe sound is crisp and clear, the bass is not over boosted like many \"gaming\" headphones tend to do. The flex wire around the base where you connect the stereo jack is a nice added touch, I've lost many headphones in the past due to that fraying\/splitting."}
{"review":"The Audio-Technica ATH-M30 have earned a spot on BoldList's Top 5 Passive Noise-Cancelling Headphones list!\n\nPros:\n- Exceptional clarity and sonic accuracy for mixing\n- Circumaural design ensures superior isolation\n- Gold-plated 1\/8\" (3.5 mm) stereo connector with strain relief and professional screw-on 1\/4\" (6.3 mm) adapter\n\nCheck out the rest of the list before making your selection: http:\/\/boldlist.net\/top-5-headphones-passive-noise-cancelling-headphones.php"}
{"review":"it's durable product. just that, line is too long.\nok sound. they hurt you ears if you wear it for luke 2 hours, cause they squeeze your ears pretty hard."}
{"review":"Great headphones for the price. I bought a set from Sears, they broke and one side quit working in one week. I have used these every day for 2 months, I would buy again anytime. Fast shipping also. Another nice thing, the cord is real long, if they ever wear out they would make a good dog leash."}
{"review":"My husband works in a busy place. He is in a little cubicle so he hears all that everyone else is saying and doing.\nHe wanted these to help muffle the sound, and to hear nice music while he works. He loves them and says that they are quite comfortable on his ears. He said that they work really, really well for muffling out the outside noise too."}
{"review":"I'm not an audiophile, so all I can really say about the sound of these headphones is that they will allow you to hear the instruments of a song more distinctly and clearly than super cheap headphones. I don't think I could go back to using $5 - $20 headphones after this.\n\nThe main thing I'm happy about with this pair of headphones is durability. I've owned these for a year and a half now, and I can say they are very well built. I'm kind of a slob when it comes to cabling, and I just let the very long cable lay on the floor, so I would often accidentally step on the cable, raise my head, and have the headset pulled off and hit the hard wood floor. These headphones still function perfectly despite dropping them countless times.\n\nThe cable, like I said, is very long. It feels nice and rubbery, and it's surely very durable from all the times I accidentally yanked my own headphones off or ripped the plug from my computer. As a bonus, included with these headphones a 3.5 mm female to 1\/4'' male converter that you can screw on to the headphones plug. Perfect for a guitar amp."}
{"review":"Great sounding and very durable headphones. They've been in my home studio for several years now without a single issue. No other set of cans have stood up to this torture test. lol"}
{"review":"I bought these a long time ago because of convincing reviews in hopes that I could make a pair of headphones last a while for a change. Fast forward a year and a few months, and these still work perfectly."}
{"review":"I had these headphones for over 3 years and they still work beautifully. The only complaint I would have is that the padding gets worn out over time so you'll need to replace them after about 2 years."}
{"review":"I love these headphones. They are a great bargain and the sound quality is very nice and clear. They block out background noise very well. The range of sound is great too, you can hear the bass very nicely"}
{"review":"Could not be more pleased with these headphones for my studio work. Comfortable, accurate... and no coiled-up cord to get in my way. LOVE them."}
{"review":"I bought these headphones after reading the comments about its durability. I am using these headphone in gym for past 3 years. Its really very durable and sound quality is also very good. Wire and headphone jack is also of good quality and I never faced any problem with connecting headphone with various phones. For the price, its a very good deal."}
{"review":"I have two sets of these headphones for my elderly father. He loves them. Can turn up the volume with driving my mother crazy. Perfect gift for music lover."}
{"review":"These are pretty good. These aren't as comfortable as Dre Beats, nor do they have the looks. But as my Studios are getting repaired (won't have them for at least a month), these headphones have above average quality. It's the main reason I got them. These surely will suffice until I get the Studios back, can't beat the price for what you're getting."}
{"review":"These are my work place staple... Granted I have been told I look like a air traffic controller in my cubicle, but I honestly don't care! With this baby on it is quiet bliss!!"}
{"review":"These headphones don't have it. Not good overall audio\nquality. Headphone are heavy and fatiguing to wear, add\nto that the large 1\/4 audio plug which is outdated today."}
{"review":"I have had these cheap headphones for 2 years now and they are showing no sign of wear. Sound it contained within ear peice. If I wear it too long, it can start to squeeze my head, but well worth the price."}
{"review":"I love these headphones. Absolutely love them. I've owned them for two years now and they are working to the same quality as the day I took them out of the box. My only complaint is that they are a little too snug around the ears, so after a while, my ears starts to hurt, but this has been after 8+ hours of having them on."}
{"review":"Quality of sound was just ok and the plug got bent within the first 2 weeks causing me to have to rewire them and a trip to Radio Shack. Kids were involved on a road trip with them plugged into the rear console for listening to a movie but still disappointing. Got a pair of Monster headphones recently on sale for just under $100 and they blow these away."}
{"review":"A few years later and I'm finally writing a review.  Yes they still work, and in great shape after almost daily use.\n\nThe cable is still soft and shows no signs of wear even after being stepped on and slammed in drawers.\n\nThe foam ear cups are looking a tad worn, but I have a stubble beard that kinda gives them some extra wear.\n\nThe sound is almost perfect quality, not overly bass and not tinny sounding either."}
{"review":"While I am not an expert on headphones, I honestly believe that these headphones are the best in the world at this price point. The sound quality has other less expensive headphones beat by a mile and may be better than some of the more expensive brands as well. The fact that the seller (Beach Camera) didn't charge sales tax is an added bonus. Anyone thinking about buying a pair of proper over-ear headphones should consider a pair of these."}
{"review":"Comfortable, good sound.  I especially like the cable coming out the left side only.\nCord is a little too long for use in my room,  but it's great when I'm in the cave at night."}
{"review":"I really liked these headphones they lasted me a good 2 1\/2 years. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because after the 2 1\/2 years the ear piece leather started to break down and flake off. This is a common problem after a lot of use. The sound quality was good but could have been better. I really like the over the ear design."}
{"review":"The sound is great... what I don't like so much is they make my ears hot... perhaps they seal up to the side of my head too well... there is little to no breathable-ness to these  (I know that sounds weird, but its been my experience... like if i watch a movie...  i find them uncomfortable to wear for that long of time... my ears get warm and sweaty.)"}
{"review":"I can't tighten these small enough around to fit properly on my head. And they fit very tight on me. They crunch my earrings when I have them on and it's very uncomfortable. I don't use them anymore because of these reasons. I prefer noise removing ear buds instead."}
{"review":"It has nice soft ear pads, and it sounds great, very clear, it has a good quality 3.5 mm plug and its very light weight however the ear pads are starting to peel, (I've had them over a year) and they have a kind of cheap feel to them because of the plastic parts so you tend to be extra careful not to rough it up, additionally i cannot wear for long periods as my ears start to hurt but it do have some big ears so that might be the major factor there, overall its a nice product. Four stars"}
{"review":"Just to be clear, these are monitor headphones meant for accurate listening. These are NOT for epic bass-leisure listening. These were intended for engineers or other work\/scientific purposes. If you're expected 808's to blow you're brains out, these are not for you. If you push the bass too hard, the drivers will fade very fast (as I found out). Besides that, the cable is quality and more than lengthy (almost annoyingly so).\nAgain, would NOT advise for casual listening, but great for at home, accurate sonic listening. Plus for the price they're a solid choice."}
{"review":"I've bought these headphones here on Amazon a while back. Initially they were quite good but the latex on the ear padding has begun to crack and chip away (3 stars for that) otherwise they've been ok."}
{"review":"The headphones work great for me so far. The sound is great and I can hear all the bass in music and low frequency effects in the movies I watch, which makes my experience so much better."}
{"review":"Great headphones for the price. I'm so happy!! I love how long the cord is. Just wish they were a bit tighter but still sound great"}
{"review":"They stopped working within 2 months and I cared for them like they were a living child.... the seller wouldn't even replace them... please don't buy them."}
{"review":"Very nice set of headphones.  The cord is nicely wrapped and long. Quality is great for the price. Would recommend to anyone needing a set of good quality headphones without breaking your budget!"}
{"review":"Paid $40 in 2011.\nI use them at work.\nThey still sound great.\nThey are still holding up after 4 years.\nNo problem with connections or wires.\nNot too tight not too loose.\nAt this point even if they broke I'd probably buy them again."}
{"review":"The plastic slowly peels away and the tension in the headphones is painful at first.\n\nAfter wearing them long enough and stretching them out daily they fit well and the sound quality is solid for the price."}
{"review":"These are the best headphones I have ever purchased! I was looking for great bass and a clear sound (not muffled like some headphones seem to be), and these headphones deliver both! I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for the same qualities as I was in a pair of headphones. I am very happy that I decided to purchase these! Even though these headphones do not come with a noise cancelling feature, they still deliver amazing sound. That feature is not necessary with these headphones."}
{"review":"These are good headphones for the price. I use these for long flights. Sometimes, I wear them just to drown out surrounding sound. That helps with my sleep. That said, I took 1 star off cos it's not as comfortable as it could be. It hurts my ears after wearing them for a while."}
{"review":"Best Monitoring Headphones for the money. I mostly use it for recording and I can hear all the tracks. Not too bassy and treble is good. Perfect for monitoring."}
{"review":"These headphones are amazing quality for the price.  The sounds are really great; when using them I can hear parts of songs I didn't notice were there before.  The Bass is great too!!  I would say the only issue I have with them is that the cord gets tangled up REALLY easily which really is the only indicator that these aren't $100+ headphones in my opinion.  I've had them for 6-8 months now and they are just as great as when I first got them (and I use them EVERYDAY, throw them around in my car and bag, etc).  I bought these originally to practice and write music on my synth and midi-keyboard without disturbing the roommates and they are perfect for that since you can hear such a range of frequencies at good quality.  If you are looking for economical yet quality headphones that will last more than a few months, I would highly recommend these!"}
{"review":"I'm gonna keep this short but in short, I had these headphones for about a year and a half and they were amazing. I honestly didn't take the best care of mine but if I had they would've lasted me much longer, these headphones are sturdy, strong and sound great."}
{"review":"These headphones are superb quality for the price. I can never go back to crappy ear buds. I want to get a better pair than this after having them for some time, but for the price, nothing beats these headphones. I recommend them to all my friends. The only thing that is kind of annoying is the wire length, but then that works better for in the studio.\n\nI recommend these if you want a high-quality audio experience but can't spend more than $40 or so. You will be very happy.\n\nEdit: After about a year, the head band snapped in half rendering these unusable. They didn't take overabuse so be warned."}
{"review":"GREAT headphones. Comes with the 1\/4 adaptor that screws on so I can switch out between the 1\/8 and 1\/4 plugs, has great sound, and fits great, and has soft pads. I've gone through a few headphones and this is definitely the best for the price, and one of the best I've ever owned regardless of price."}
{"review":"Hands down the best quality, and best sounding headphones in this price range. The cord is ungodly long, these shine as stationary listeners, but can be cumbersome for those on the move."}
{"review":"Have had these for over a year and the sound quality is great and does an ok job of filtering outside noise.\n\nI can wear these for an extended period of time and my ears won't get too sore...size, cushion and design keep it comfortable.\n\nGood price, good product."}
{"review":"I use these to play listen to music and play Rocksmith with my bass.  I'm very impressed with the range, and as a bass player I think the bass sounds good in them.  My ears don't get hot even after extended sessions.  I think they're an excellent value.  I HIGHLY recommend them."}
{"review":"Just not what I wanted could be my phone to but it has no volume just not loud at all and when I use the equalizer it distorts it sorry but its like I bought a 20$ pair of headphones."}
{"review":"I have always been on the look-out for a solid pair of headphones that wouldn't burst too big a hole in my pocket and being under $50, I would say that this headphone is worth a buy, though it wouldn't be considered a steal.\n\nMoreover, given that fact that it is made by one of the more established headphone makers (Audio Technica), I was more willing to give it a shot. The wire that comes with the headphones are long, and depending on what you use it for - it could be a boon or a bane. For me, I used it for my laptop which is just placed in front of me so I did not know what else to do with the excess wire. However, if you are watching television in the living room, the long wire helps when you would love some stereo sound to yourself.\n\nThe ear-muffs as I call them are heavily padded, which means that your ears would get hurt or pain or any tension from long hours of hearing from the headphones though that wouldn't be recommended. The bass is low, loud and heavy, something definitely worth expecting from a pair of titanium speakers.\n\nThe overhead 'hairband' is also heavily padded, allowing for much cushion on your head. However, one of the bad sides to this otherwise decent headphones is that there is the lack of adjustable volume controls. You would have to control the volume from your laptop or from wherever you have connected your headphones too.\n\nSound 9\/10\nDesign 8\/10\nPortability 7\/10\nPrice 8\/10\nOverall 8\/10"}
{"review":"I connect these to my guitar rig for quiet playing late at night. They sound great, I can't tell between the speaker cab and the headphones."}
{"review":"These headphones have superb fidelity. They are studio quality in my opinion (I would know, I have spent years in recording studios). The cord is long enough for just about any purpose. The only reason I only gave them three stars is because they are over-the-ear headphones, but not over-the-ear enough. After about a couple hours of use, they will start to hurt your ears and they become quite uncomfortable. I purposely bought over-the-ear headphones to avoid the discomfort of prolonged use of on-ear phones; these just didn't do the trick in that regard. All that said, though, these headphones sound great. Maybe I just have big ears."}
{"review":"Just Do IT! LOL\n\nJust get them.\n\nSound was so loud when someone walked by me while I was cleaning, I jumped, couldn't hear the sound of the others around me.. Pretty scary, but great. :D"}
{"review":"Awesome headphones, but the cord is very long. These offer quite a bit of noise isolation from your environment without being noise canceling. My wife and I both enjoy listening to Jazz, piano, and blues on these."}
{"review":"Great headphones, but after a couple of years the cover started chipping off the earpieces. Its a shame, because it makes an otherwise completely working product uncomfortable\/unusable."}
{"review":"Great headphones. Only annoyance is that the cord is EXTREMELY long.  This might be a good thing for some folks though.  I primarily use these headphones on airline flights where the excess cord length is unnecessary and frankly gets in the way sometimes."}
{"review":"OW! After long durations of wear, these headphones hurt. They pinch my ear against my head and no amount of maneuvering can fix it. The noise cancellation and audio are great, but I want to replace these with something more comfortable."}
{"review":"They sound great!  They are sensitive enough to perform well when driven by a mobile device, but a headphone amp really helps open up the bass.  The cord is extremely long.  This is a great feature as long as you don't expect much in the way of portability.  They are very comfortable on my large head.  Really a great value."}
{"review":"Pretty uncomfortable... cord is way too long. Very large, heavy, bulky. Can only wear for 20 minutes before discomfort sets in. The 3.5mm male end has a spring so it doesn't short out over extended use but the spring got all bent and came out after only a day so that was stupid."}
{"review":"I find speakers and headphones follow a similar quality vs. price curve to jeans. What I mean by that is spending tons of money often doesn't get you that much more that the mid-grade stuff. Yes, there's a certain amount of money you have to put in to get something halfway decent, but it doesn't have to be hundreds or even thousands of dollars. For example, with jeans I find that the difference between a $20 pair and a $70 pair is huge. At the same time, while a $300 pair of jeans will be better than a $70 pair, I don't find the difference nearly as profound as the difference between the $20 and $70 pair, and definitely not worth the extra $230. These headphones are basically the $70 pair of jeans. Yes, you could probably find something that's slightly better out there if you wanted to drop a lot of money, but it wouldn't be worth it in my book. These are the best value because they provide the most bang for the buck. They're not the cheapest, but they give you very good sound quality for a moderate price. I will always take that over low quality and dirt cheap or extremely high quality and extremely expensive."}
{"review":"I've always had cheap $5-$10 headphones, but wanted something nicer for the online classes I'm taking this semester, these are great. I love the full closure. It really cancels out noise. The wire is pretty long, which is a pro for some and a con for others. Personally, I wish the wire was a tad shorter. It's always dragging on the floor when I'm sitting at my desk. Other than that, I love them."}
{"review":"My husband is a drummer and uses these for his electronic drum set.  He says he can hear layers of the music he had never heard before."}
{"review":"I just recently upgraded my headphone setup to a $600 headphone\/amp\/dac setup and I can say that it sounds great. BUT at work, I still use my M30s and I still love them. I recommend them to everyone who asks. They sound great and have little to no bass boost which I like. But they perform very well with a software bass boost."}
{"review":"Its good sound. I record music. For the price I am satisfied for sure. When I take it off with one hand it snaps back and the plastic side of the ears clank together. Other than that you cant hear them from outside. (while on someone else) and are fairly good at keeping out outside noise. Not sad I purchased them, but will someday upgrade for sure."}
{"review":"These are so popular I really thought they would be better.\n\nMy first issue is that they did not fit my ears properly, the pads are too thin and they squeezed my ears, which caused them to become very uncomfortable after about 45-60mins. I tried adjusting them every which way but It seems I needed to modify the pads.\n\nMy second issue is that the right speaker completely stopped working after about 3 months of very light use. I never put them too loud and never dropped them. They sat on my head or my desk always. Really sucks to have them die out so quickly.\n\nSound quality wise these are OK. They definitely were detailed and quick accurate, but they definitely lacked the sound quality I expected. They also were very anemic in the bass department, it was almost non-existent.\n\nI now use the Sennheiser HD-360 (in the link) and enjoy them much much more. Very comfortable, better sounding, and cheaper.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00I0SCD72\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00I0SCD72&linkCode=as2&tag=dan010f-20&linkId=Q52NQGHSMAOFG5XH"}
{"review":"I use these headphones for late night gaming at home and also on airplanes. For home use  they have an extremely long cord which makes it easy to plug them into your receiver, but this is kind of a hassle when traveling since you need to bundle the cord up.  Also, the default tension of the head band is on the tight side, which is fine for wearing the headphones normally, but if you want to lower them and hang them around your neck for a little bit, they will squeeze your neck a bit which is uncomfortable. The cord is very thick and has a protector near the jack to keep it from getting kinked, and so far that has worked for me.  For the price the sound quality is very good; rich and well balanced. So, in summary, they aren't perfect in every regard but they seem like a good value to me."}
{"review":"I gave these as a Christmas gift and he wanted to note that while other headphones he's tried bother his ears, these are roomy enough to cover all of them and don't have that issue."}
{"review":"These headphones are great - my son loves them over his beats. It has a long cord, which is really great so he can be at a distance while listening\/watching. The insulation is great too, so you'll tune out most of the other noise, despite the Beats. along with comfortable ear pads and arch, which extends nicely on our heads. Really would recommend this!"}
{"review":"5 years later and still in use working great. They are a good pair of headphones. I have a pair of beats by Dr. Dre and these, as far as sound is concerned, these are way better, but I wear the beats more often because of the comfort factor though, but you are comparing way different price range at that point. Get these for long-lasting, good sounding headphones, but if you plan on listening for a long time (which is not healthy for your ears) get something that weighs less."}
{"review":"Great quality headphones for a reasonable price.  Only heads up is the super long cable, since they're studio quality headphones.  Looks pretty goofy but I just have a zip tie thing to coil it up to the length I need"}
{"review":"Great headphones but they begin to get a bit uncomfortable after about 30 minutes of use because of the pressure they put on your ears."}
{"review":"I ordered these a year ago as a gift for myself and was very impressed with the sound. They sound like much more expensive set of headphones. Ordered another one for my wife this year as a gift."}
{"review":"Sound quality is fantastic! I am frustrated however because they fit like \"on ear\" headphones and rest on your ears. It's not a problem if you're using them for 30m-1hr at a time, but during extended studio sessions they begin to hurt my ears. A few other reviewers pointed out the same issue. Excellent for short use, or if you don't have problems wearing 'on ear' style headphones."}
{"review":"They alright but I like the radio shack ones that are hard to find where you can adjust the volume and they also have volume control on left right ear they are so much cheaper too."}
{"review":"Sound is very nice; however, the ear area is smaller than my ears thus the pressure makes the tops of my ears hurt after wearing for a few hours."}
{"review":"i've been using cheap JVC marshmallow earbuds lately and when i compare them to the M30s, the marshmallows actually sound better. the M30s sound muted by comparison, and i think the reason is that the earbuds provide better isolation. the fact that these are brand new and the marshmallows have had well over 1,000 hours of \"burn in\" time could also be a factor.  maybe the M30s are good when compared to other over-ear headphones but i can't make that comparison.\n\nnow i'll judge them on their own. the plastic feels cheap but i don't mind. the cord is really thick and sturdy and they're comfortable to wear. the sound is good but not great because of the muted quality they have. i ordered $70 headphones and expected something amazing, but what i got feel and sound like $35 headphones and amazon doesn't let you return something unless it's defective or unopened."}
{"review":"These work like a dream. I can hear the highs and lows wonderfully and can tune out my surroundings at work with ease. In fact they work so well that I occasionally have to take them off because I start to feel like I'm in a cave. Bought it for about $40"}
{"review":"I received these headphones for Christmas.  I was hoping to use these headphones for recording but upon seeing the size of the headphones I knew it wouldn't fit over my ears.  Sure enough these headphones did not cover my ears.  For the price and the intent of these headphones I was severely disappointed that these headphones would be manufactured so small.\nI only gave it 3 stars for the quality.\nI have the Koss UR20 I use at work and these definitely fit OVER my ears.  If anyone knows of a high quality headphone used for recording please comment.  Thanks."}
{"review":"I've owned these headphones for nearly three years now. They've held up well and still sound great.\n\nMy only gripe with it has been that the ear pads clamp the arms of my glasses against my head and make my ears sore after using for a while. If you don't wear glasses you shouldn't have this problem."}
{"review":"These are fantastic monitor headphones for mixing and listening. However, they don't cancel nearly enough noise to make them usable long-term as practice headphones for drums or guitar - for that I'd look elsewhere. The max volume is also much too quiet for doing that as well. Otherwise, they rock!"}
{"review":"Real bad headphones. No bass at all. For over the ear headphone, u can hear every thing around you. Do not waste your money. Get sony: MDR-V55"}
{"review":"Had these for about a year now & haven't had 1 problem yet besides 1 of the ear cup cushions sliding off after I fell asleep with the on all night...But I woke up the next morning & placed it back on without difficulty...I've bought more expensive headsets that lasted not quite the time these do with durability....To myself they sound the best with my laptop & then second best when plugged up to my Yamaha AV receiver & the sound when plugged to my ipod touch come in around 3rd..\n\nAlthough these aren't high end,their sound quality definitely doesn't disappoint  me..."}
{"review":"It feels comfortable and is obviously of decent quality. The sound is not as good quality as the description would have you believe. It sounds slightly better than a cheap set of headphones. The sound it allows into your ears cuts out a lot of the bass and produces a higher-pitched version of whatever you are playing, which can be annoying. Probably easily corrected manually, but if you can't manually correct for it, it isn't going to be pleasant. I wish I had bought a different pair and if music is your thing, than buy something better than this."}
{"review":"They work but wish I had bought something different. Volume between inputs seems to vary for some reason. i know it doesn't make sense to me either."}
{"review":"I am so happy to own these, it makes me realize I've been wasting my time with cheap headphones.  I will never buy another cheap pair again as long as I know these exist.  Seller was fast and efficient, especially considering I ordered around black Friday sales."}
{"review":"MUSIC SOUNDS AMAZING WITH THESE HEADPHONES!!!!!\nHigh quality sound and comfortable for wearing.  The cable is a bit long, but honestly it's not too much of a bother.  I bought it for listening to music and was satisfied because it did a very good job at playing all my favorite songs"}
{"review":"I bought them for my son, as noise-cancelling headphones. They do their job, and he says they are quite comfortable.  While I can not comment on the quality of sound, they served the purpose, and are quite cheap."}
{"review":"My three daughters had been using three sets for the last two years and we have nothing bad to say.\nWe love the quality, design and comfort. I would not buy anything else.\nLove Audio-Tecnica headphones."}
{"review":"Nice sound quality (note: I am in no way an audiophile, nor do I claim to be one), and comfortable for extended wearing.\n\nMy only complaint would be about the cord. It is quite long (probably designed for studio use, not necessarily sitting at a laptop) and it does get tangled easily. Minor complain though, honestly."}
{"review":"Sound - These headphones are the first high quality headphones I have purchased, and I have no complaints in that department. The balance between highs and low is fantastic and they're definitely great to listen with, whether it movie, TV show, or music.\n\nComfort - Sometimes, when I wear them too long, they can feel a bit tight on my head, but I expect that to fade as I continue to use them. I've only had them for just over a week.\n\nComplaints - The cord is a bit long, but that a minor aspect. The direct problem of the long cord is the questionable connection that the audio plug has. If the plug is disturbed in the slightest manner, there is a variety of problems that comes from that; the sound can disappear from either of the headphones, static starts accompanying the sound, the highs and lows proportionally become distorted, etc.\n\nOverall, I do like these headphones, they just require me to be more cautious with my movements around the cord, else I disturb what I'm listening to."}
{"review":"Good sound quality for the price. My only complaint is the excessively long wire. I am  six foot two inches tall an the wire dangles to the ground when i have the headphones on my ear and my phone in my pocket."}
{"review":"I bought these in order to listen to music and watch videos on an overseas flight. Worked for me. Good sound quality and blocked out the airplane noise and the screams from jet-lagged kids."}
{"review":"I love the sound quality of these headphones. They're very clear, and the bass is just the right amount. My only complaint is that the padding doesn't create enough depth for my ears, and it presses on the center of my ears. I'm not sure if I just have big ears or what, but if I wear these for more than 3 hours or so, my ears start to hurt, and I have to take them off."}
{"review":"Good for the price, but don't be too rough with them. I had them in my backpack during school for a couple weeks, and now the audio only comes from one ear if the cord is bent a certain way."}
{"review":"A pretty good pair of headphones for all the reasons elaborated on here. I have  pretty much nothing to add but describe how they finally broke  - The metal \"spring\" around the plug fell off after about 2 years, and the connection finally broke about 1.5 years after that. I never went to great lengths to keep them in great condition, I threw them in my bag often enough without much regard for the cord. And it finally broke after ~3.5 years of abuse. Ah well!\n\n~ 3.5 years is a decent life for headphones costing around 50 bucks. I think I'll buy them again."}
{"review":"These headphones are exactly what I was looking for.  I'm not an audio tech guru, but these fold up easily which is what I wanted primarily and the sound is phenomenal in my opinion."}
{"review":"Very impressed with the build quality of my Audio Technicas. They're just finally showing the wear\/abuse (light abuse, not hardcore) I've put them through the past 3 ish (bought them in December 2011) years. Still sound great, and all the construction is solid; ear pads are starting to peel a little and the headband is starting to crease\/crack a little visibly. All visual wear and tear. The (11 ft!) cord is strong and unkinked still, and the jack end is well protected and have had no problems.\nThrow 'em around, throw 'em in a bag full of crap with just a loose wrap of the cord (if that; it's usually a large mess of tangle), they're fine. Just don't step on 'em or anything. Mom managed to break the plastic supporting arm of one of the cups on her set, but mine have survived me."}
{"review":"After using ear-buds for years I finally got these for my desk. Great sound for the price, very comfortable, and not so big that you need an external DA amplifier."}
{"review":"We bought 2 of those for work for editing videos. You wouldn't expect it from a girl, but I have a big head and big ears as my ex always said. To give you an idea, I need an XL Baseball helmet. Therefore I have some issues when it comes to headphones as they often start hurting on my head or ears. Not with those! Sofar they have been pretty comfy and yes, I am wearing them for hours at work."}
{"review":"These made my jaw sore when wearing them.  I have naturally tense jaw muscles, but still, these were not comfortable for more than 5 minutes or so."}
{"review":"Great product. I was pleasantly surprised at how well these headphones blocked outside noise. They're not listed as noise-cancelling, but they do a great job of it none-the-less."}
{"review":"For the price, these headphones are great.  The only issue I have is that the cord is close to 12' long.  Oftentimes it is great, but usually too long.  Other than that, no problems whatsoever.  They are comfortable, and the sound is great."}
{"review":"Working fine. Sounds good.  Strong build. Not the best choice for children or folks with small heads, but still okay.  Probably a REALLY GOOD CHOICE for folks with huge heads and\/or low ears."}
{"review":"Bought these because of the reviews and price from Amazon. But must say they sound pretty weak. My brother has a old set of headphones of another brand and they kill these for sound quality. I have listen to Bose, Sony and a few others at Best buy and all sounded better then these. I still have not figure out which Head set to buy."}
{"review":"These headphones are excellent for recording because they block out sounds around you and let you hear details in the piece your listening to.  They're great!"}
{"review":"Probably my favorite set of headphones I've ever purchased. I had tried cheaper headphones and were constantly disappointed by the sound quality but also the build quality. These were a game changer.\n\nI use them at work to hide the fact that I have different music tastes from everyone else. Despite the title of this review, I listen to death metal, not something most people in the workplace enjoy overhearing. Plug these in, cover your ears and no one will be the wiser. They fit snuggly on the head and the adjustments pieces are easy to work. They don't feel cheaply made like many other brands. The chord is insanely long, meaning I often have to wind it up so it doesn't get caught in my chair but that's no big deal.\n\nSound quality is amazing. Even better is that I cannot hear any outside noise once these are on. I turned up a few melodies that were ear-bleeding loud and no one in the office could hear it. That's a win for everyone. They get 5 stars in my book. Solid build, great sound quality, long chord, and removes nearly all outside noise. This is a winner."}
{"review":"These headphones are phenomenal. I can't go back to using headphones with less quality because I always wish I had these on my head again. I can 'feel' the music so cleanly when using these."}
{"review":"These headphones stink. You have to really turn up whatever device you are using to hear anything, and if it is on the loud side, the sound gets distorted. My cheap pair of ear buds are better than these. And they are not noise cancelling at all. You can easily hear outside noise. Booooo."}
{"review":"Amazing sound! I'm impressed. I love the extra long cord, and I like that it doesn't squeeze my head too tight like most other headphones do. However, do to my extreme pickiness and sensitivity to anything touching my ears, I rarely use this because just the soft touch around my ears for extended duration causes me a headache. I mostly use it to podcast for an hour and then take it off. Still to this day, when it comes to comfort, nothing beats a pair of ear buds in my opinion."}
{"review":"This was a gift for my Mentor at christmas.. he is THE DEFINITION of a music lover.. he told me that the sound was really great and clear.. so i bet he means it when it comes to listening to clear & crisp tunes"}
{"review":"Excellent headphones. very good quality of sound, especially for the price. Bought a used pair and did not regret my purchase. Good for if you wish to play games on the computer or watch videos but need to remain quiet."}
{"review":"Easy to use headphones, no frills. Amazing quality for the price. No need batteries. Just plug and go, I use for recording voice stuff with my iphone or mac!"}
{"review":"I have been using this headphone for more than a year and i am pretty satisfied with it, its really a great head phone for this price."}
{"review":"The Audio-Technica ATH-M30 Professional Studio Monitor Closed-back Dynamic headphones are a great value. They have a pretty good full range response and feel very comfortable on my ears while blocking out most of the outside noise. I would recommend this product."}
{"review":"awesome headphones... love them. The only issue I have is the top of my head after wearing them feels a bit sore but the headphones are well constructed and sound wonderful and have a nice long cord."}
{"review":"WOW!! This earphones are just perfection. For the price there's nothing better. My only complain is that the description said ATH-M30 but I got the M20x. Not sure what is the difference between both but I'm happy with what I got. The earphones arrived in perfect condition in the original box."}
{"review":"Solid performance and good comfort.  Long line so if you're plugging in to play, say electric guitar, you'll have plenty of room to walk around."}
{"review":"Great sound quality, very comfortable over the ears. The cord is about 10 feet long, which is great for studio monitoring, but if you're looking for something more portable, you might want to look elsewhere"}
{"review":"Have had this for over a year now and it still works fine.\nIf you have ears that stick out...Be prepared to have red ears lol."}
{"review":"Only problem is they don't have a microphone, so if I want to use them to skype online or for a phone conversation, they're not the best pair. Also, they don't completely cover my giant ears, which gets uncomfortable after a while. Otherwise, amazing for the price, I can really zone out with some music on, they block noise out very nicely."}
{"review":"Not worth the money.  I bought these after reading a stellar review on C-Net.  The audio is really nothing special, for headphones that are supposed to be \"professional\"."}
{"review":"Listening to previously heard music is like a new experience due to the clarity and quality these headphones provide. Great product  especially for the price."}
{"review":"Feel great while I'm wearing them for a while. They're a bit uncomfortable for extended periods but great sound quality for the price. Only complaint about build quality is that the driver housing feels like cheap plastic but other than that they're awesome. Not the strongest bass but meh, good enough."}
{"review":"I returned these headphones. I got them to used them on my piano, but my piano sounded awful on them. So I returned them and got a pair of good, expensive headphones instead."}
{"review":"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend these.  They worked for a while, then dead.  Checked all connections, batteries, etc.  Nothing.  If you're looking for a good product, look elsewhere."}
{"review":"Holy cow, do these things sound good! The bass is great, the highs clear. The cord is long, and the jack as a reinforced spring around the cord for durability. The head strap feels a bit tight right now after being adjusted for my head, but maybe that is because the headphones are just new. But I think these things will last a long time (and I go through a set of headphones at least every 6 months). I am not overly particular about sound, since I don't get overly engrossed in frequencies and watts, and the whole bit. If the 'phones sound good, and don't fall apart right away, I'm happy. Great headphones for the price!"}
{"review":"Had these for probably a year or more and they're still holding up. Good sound and nice thick wire that doesn't get wrecked. And I'm not the most careful person with my electronics."}
{"review":"These are the best headphones I have used.  Very affordable but the sound quality is on par with the higher priced headphones.  These headphones are worth the investment if you are creating music."}
{"review":"Can't believe it. I haven't had them more than a week, have barely used them so far, and already it shorted out somehow. The right headphone doesn't work anymore. What a huge disappointment. I wish I had paid more attention to the 1 star reviews before buying, I wouldn't have imagined this would happen. Just garbage."}
{"review":"I use these when I'm at work.  Absolutely the best headphones I've bought so far!  The price is right, they sound great, no problems whatsoever with these.  I'm happy!"}
{"review":"I've had these bad boys for over a year. Good sound, solid build. Nothing life changing but they're great for the $30 I spent on them. Very long cable which is great."}
{"review":"I am So incredibly happy with this purchase. I have had these headphones for over a year now, and I have no intentions of replacing them any time soon. The sound quality is superb, and they are comfortable. I wear glasses, and they don't even cause that painful pinching that a lot of over the ear headphones can cause.\n\nUltimately, I recommend. Great, affordable pair of headphones.\n\nCheers!"}
{"review":"Great set of headphones that comes with a long cord so I can move around my room or office a bit without pulling my laptop or phone with me.\n\nPros - VERY comfortable to wear and sounds great.  Nice amount of base without overpowering the sound.  Would recommend listening to FLAC music files to really appreciate the quality.\n\nCons - Because the cord is so long, it would be nice to be able to replace the cord when going out and about, but the cord is hardwired into the headphones.  Would also like it if they were able to be folded for easy storage.\n\nOverall - For the price, great set of headphones  with rich sound and build quality.  Would have liked the detachable cord but if you really want that, I'd recommend a higher models by Audio-Technica which have this feature."}
{"review":"These headphones are by far the best bang for your buck I have tried in this price range. Very clear audio, rich tones and extremely comfortable. The cable also is much thicker than most headphones I have tried and overall they seem very durable. Again, for the price they cannot be beat. The only two things I can think of that could make these just a bit better would be if the cable was removable, as it is super long (which is awesome) but annoying for storing them; and it is nice in case the cable gets damaged. Also, they could be a bit louder as we use them to play drums with, but for everyday listening they are fantastic."}
{"review":"The flat sound of this studio headphone is amazing. It delivers exactly as advertised. I'm looking forward to e higher audio-technica professional headphone now. But for now this one does the job and i'm gone buy the extra pads just in case this one breaks down or falls of. Does anybody knows which ones to buy? For people who don't know this is not a headphone for people who want's to just listen to music. The bass response is not as you imagine it is designed for musicians."}
{"review":"Headphones have a great sound and quality, but beware it will take a while for your ears to adapt if you have been using a gaming headset or anything along those lines."}
{"review":"These headphones are one of the best around.  I own several headsets but these are my favorite.  So much that my New M50 are still in the box since April."}
{"review":"Feel pressure on head after wearing for a short time. I have a smallish head--don't know how that may figure into the discomfort level. I'll go for something lighte next time."}
{"review":"I've had these headphones for many years before writing this review. The sound quality is great. They hurt my ears a little after a few hours of use. The cord length is extreme which is great because I can lie in bed and use them while they're connected to the computer. Overall very good and still working great after all this time."}
{"review":"Amazing headphones for the mid price range. Comfortable headphones for smaller head. I was able to hear all the notes and clarity wasn't distorted and high volume. I believe they are better than beats by dre. Don't get fool by the hype dre is all bass and no treble. Lol hint Megan trainor"}
{"review":"I am going to start with the good, then get to the bad after.\n\nThe Good:\n-They have a VERY balanced sound, which is fantastic for my needs, as I am doing amateur music production.\n-They are quite comfortable! I can wear these babies all day with little to no discomfort.\n-The cable is long enough for most studio needs!\n-Comes with an 1\/4 inch adapter that is very high quality.\n\nThe Bad (not actually BAD, just kind of warnings):\n-These are not the type of headphones to wear around in public, they are not super stylish.\n-They are not average music LISTENING headphones, these are for studio work. They are meant to be balanced.\n-The cable is too long for regular music listening from an iPod in your pocket. Suited for studio work.\n\nSo to summarize, if you are looking for affordable\/comfortable\/high quality studio headphones to listen to mixes or to listen to TV through, THESE ARE IT!!!"}
{"review":"The cord is extremely long on these headphones, but it's not enough of a deal breaker that I'd give it less than five stars. The sound is great, and the closed back keeps my music in my ears. They do a fairly good job muffling outside noise, and music on Spotify sounds absolutely mind-blowing on them. Seriously, these headphones are one of the best Christmas presents I've ever received."}
{"review":"These are fine for the price. Sometimes I get sound in just one ear. Not sure what that issue is, but I'm still enjoying them."}
{"review":"I bought these for my daughter.  They're nicer than my BOSE headphones and they sound just as good.  The build quality of these blows my BOSE away.  They have a flimsy wire and plug on the end while these have a thick, long cord with a gold tipped plug.  They're just so much higher quality all the way around.  What an amazing buy for this price!"}
{"review":"I work in a cube farm where a lot of people have decided to use speaker phone. These headphones make it possible to complete my work without distraction from others."}
{"review":"I just bought and returned 4 different pairs of headphones.  All were around $50 and some were noise canceling and some not.  All were crap though.  I finally started doing some research online and came across these ones.  Rated very high for a reason!  Excellent sound quality and dampen out noise from outside very well.  Comfortable and fit great!\n\nOnly heads up is the cord is like 8 feet long but if you're cool with that, get these headphones.  They are awesome."}
{"review":"I recently purchased these headphones after using an old pair of sennheiser HD202s for about 5 years. I have been extremely disaapointed and I can only describe every moment wearing these headphones as filled to the brim with suffering and I can only hope that I've avoided long term damage from my very limited usage of these headphones. These headphones pressed on my head so hard that after the 2 hours of use on the first day of ownership my left ear swelled to the point where I lost most of my hearing for the better part of two weeks, I had to go to a doctor to get a special solution to unjam the earwax build up that was trigger by the absolutely piss poor ergonomics of these uncomfortable and shallow cans.\n\nI learned my lesson Sennheiser, don't abandon the brands you know work for you."}
{"review":"Frequencies are clear. Bass is perfect...just remember they're monitors, not bass boosting thumpers.\nWhat I can tell you is that I hear what was wrong with old mixes (I added too much bass) I made with \"CAD audio\". I didn't know at the time the mixes were bad unless I took them out to the car stereo. Now, these headphones show what I did wrong.\nYou also can't go wrong with the price..This order was filled correctly, shipped promptly and all for a very competitive headphones on the market"}
{"review":"I have enjoyed these headphones.  Use them almost every day.  Clear sound.  Bass doesn't drive me out of my mind.  Can't see any wear even after over a year of use."}
{"review":"I love this headphone. Very clear for Indian vocal music.  For this price, this is good buy. I am buying another higher version of this now.  it is very comfortable for long  hours of listening."}
{"review":"They get the job done. Not bad at all for the price; the best I've tried in this price range.\n\nThe cord is insanely long, which is great for studios and terrible for using them at the gym, which is nearly impossible. But that's a small gripe.\n\nLike I said, they're fairly balanced bass\/treble but they could be louder overall. That's the reason for minus one star. Still recommend them at this price though."}
{"review":"For the price I have no complaints about the sound quality and comfort. I have been using them for about a year and they have held up great."}
{"review":"ATH-M30s offer crisp, clean audio at an affordable price. These headphones have a solid, durable build, and very soft padding that make them extremely comfortable to wear."}
{"review":"Update on the ATH-M30:  I am finding this headset to be uncomfortable after wearing for more than 30 minutes.  It just seems to have too much spring tension and if your head is just a bit larger than normal, it can become rather uncomfortable.  Sound quality is still very good.  Just be prepared to take some breaks when wearing this headset."}
{"review":"Great headphones for the price.  I own 2 of these and have been very happy with them.  Just be careful not to let your cat chew the cable within the first 2 weeks of ownership."}
{"review":"Great set of office headphones. Very clear, not 100% noise cancelling but pretty close, and they can get turnt when you want. For the money, I'm incredibly satisfied with them. The cord is nice and long and seems quite durable. I can wear them for long periods of time comfortably, which is what I was looking for.\n\nAs a note, I'm no audiophile. If sound quality is your holy grail, this is probably not for you. I value reasonable audio quality and comfort. This nails both."}
{"review":"Fan air hitting the plastic of the headphones causes a extremely audible noise when you are wearing them. Very annoying. Went back to the cheap set I bought years ago. Gave them to my someone though and they loves them. Best headphones they have.\n\nAudio is good. Cord is long. Whole thing feels flimsy. Hasn't broke yet, though."}
{"review":"WOW, these are the replacement of an off the shelf 20 bucks worth headphones and wow...\n\nlistening to classical music with these babies is delicious, the clarity of FLAC media  is awesome and in most of my music library I can hear instruments that I would've sworn were not there before (I've used my old headset for more thank 5 years)"}
{"review":"I am 57 years old. I've been listening through headphones since I was about 15 years old (through my parents Marantz!! stereo system back then). Mostly classic rock (Led Zepplin, Pink Floyd, etc.)  but also Stravinsky and such. After all these years I  believe I have a few gigahertz left ( at least in the mid-range).  I've owned many headphones. THESE SUCK! Worst sounding phones I've ever owned. When dynamic passages kick in....distortion. Lousy sound quality. I have a $25.00  pair of AKG open back phones that sound better. Very disappointed. From the moment I plugged them in. Gave them a chance. Brake-in? No such thing. They either sound good or not. Probably will return them (something I rarely do.)."}
{"review":"I'm not an expert on sound equipment, but these headphones work well for me for watching TV.  The sound is very good, voices are very clear and it has a nice long cable that is not coiled.  I tried 2 other headphones that had coiled cables, but for me they pulled on the headphone when extended which made them uncomfortable.  They are well padded and pretty comfortable even after a couple hours.  And the price was reasonable."}
{"review":"these things are nice...comfy on the head. crisp sound with just rnough \"thump\" to them...got these a year ago the same time i got a psir of akg k44s n the ath30s felt like driving a cadillac compared to the honda aka the akgs. bout to order some m50s and k240s soon..the true test! lol"}
{"review":"I was looking for some headphones to block out the sounds the freshmen especially during matriculation week when its really loud. These work great because they fit over the ears and are comfortable. A little warm when wearing them but good overall."}
{"review":"Sure, the plastic could be nicer, but for the price, I don't think you could get more comfort and better sound quality. My boss has the next higher model up which feel more premium, but I'm not sure I could hear a sound difference without listening really closely and back-to-back."}
{"review":"I had heard many reviews on these headphones and quite frankly did not believe all of them.\nMost of them were quite unbelievable due to the price of the item.\n\nI ended up needing a pair of headphones to do some editing with and I thought I would give these a try mainly based on their price.\nI just don't have the money to spend hundreds of dollars on headphones right now.\nI wanted the headphones I purchased to be \"flat\" and not add any of the \"enhanced\" sound to the audio I was editing.\n\nI have now had them for a few months and they have held up quite well.\nFor their price the sound quality is quite good and I would go as far as to say excellent.\n\nI would not hesitate to buy another pair if I needed them."}
{"review":"Good pair of headphones. You can hear a lot of the background instruments and it has a very clear sound. I do wish that they would have been lighter on your head but they are very great and I enjoyed them. 5 star"}
{"review":"For the money, excellent headphones with really good sound. They are sturdy and built to last.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the cord is REALLY long.  If you are buying these to sit on the couch with a sound system many feet away, you will love the cord.  If you are using a portable audio device... you can always use the reminder of the cord as a belt.  Did I mention the cord was long."}
{"review":"Love the sound quality of these. The ear pieces are really comfortable but they keep flipping and it's a little annoying. I'm not sure if there is some point to the flipping, but every time I wear these, I need to rotate the ear part to the right side. Apart from that aspect, they work really well for the price!"}
{"review":"I bought these to use on my mower.  They do pretty good, muffle some of the mower noise, wish they did more. Other than that they are a good product."}
{"review":"These are the best headphones I've ever bought. As a person who wears glasses regularly, these were the first over-ear headphones I've ever owned that haven't annoyed me in terms of wearability. I could hardly notice them on my head! They're extremely comfortable, and the sound quality is stellar on them. The cord is extremely long as well, so you'll never need an extender. I honestly can't think of a single thing to complain about other than that the headphones don't come out and give you a back massage after you open them. Other than that, absolutely stellar for the price!"}
{"review":"I use my mothers account for all our shopping, I came across this a music lover & lemme say..\nThis has got to the best buy Ive had on amazon so far.\n\nThese headphones are amazing, comfortable. But thats not really why its so amazing Im gonna go out & juss say you'll have these for yearss & years on going. I regret all this time not taking much more care of these headphones but they still work beautifully. I recommend these headphones for anyone. I make music so I love these.  5* Audio Technica are amazing at what they do. Case closed. Very Satisfied"}
{"review":"While the sound and fit are excellent, I absolutely hate the cord. I don't know why the designers made the chord not curled to stretch since I'm always tripping over it. It almost negates the positive qualities."}
{"review":"Not bad for a relatively inexpensive closed back headphone, but I still like my old open-air Sony MDR 410 LPs better as they are much lighter and have a more balanced, natural, imho, sound than these.  Too bad they no longer make those Sonys, nor a similar replacement, as far as I can tell."}
{"review":"Since I'm coming from ear buds I really can only compare them with that experience, so to me the sound quality is a huge difference -  rich, defined, and intricate. They seem comfortable so far. I like the long cord. There is minimal outside sound dampening. The volume is decent, but I feel that may be a function of the source. On my laptop it's good, but I can't get above a certain level where I might really want to rock out loud. My TV monitor however gives more volume power than I would need.\nSo, overall I'm very content."}
{"review":"I have had a few headsets in the past. I bought two of theses. One for my son, hoping he would like them. He said, without spending hundreds of dollars, these were  the best he has had. Especially, he loves the very long cord they have. He does a lot of cooking, and the cord stretches to where ever he is."}
{"review":"Sound quality is very good for the price, but there is a loss of clarity when compared to the likes of Beyerdynamic DT 770. For me, it is less important than the price difference, but your mileage may vary.\nBuild quality is good too. I won't go into details, but for its price everything is done really well.\nBut. They are not comfortable, for me at least. A little too tight, creating a burning sensation. There is absolutely no ventilation, ears will get sweaty, especially in hot weather. Cable is a little too long and is not detachable. I don't understand why they charge so much for this important feature. Also, like usual, the minijack connector is too thick to get through original iPhone\/iPad case."}
{"review":"Great sound quality, it has the perfect amount of lows, highs and mids. The only issue is that they are not as loud as I like."}
{"review":"Obviously these aren't going to be the greatest headphones, but they beat anything else at the price.\n\nThey handle regular wear well, they're comfortable.\n\nDon't expect them to survive hitting the ground in a bag with textbooks, though. They still function, but one of both sides' supports are now held by duct tape."}
{"review":"The fit is a bit tight, but I have large ears and a big head. However, the sound is terrific and it blocks outside noise quite well."}
{"review":"Came as expected! Nice quality for the price! Beautiful sound! Bass its punchy! Really deep! And clear! Mids rocks! Doesnt sound thin or harsh! ... Highs its not amazing! Just fine! This worths every penny"}
{"review":"The low end bites big timebut then again, these aren't exactly headphones that will break the bank, so I shouldn't have expected that much.  The other con is that these headphones do not hug my ears.  Yeah, that's right - I said it.  I have yet to actually record live with these and since I do all of my recording (at the moment) with a DI the issue of sound isolation is moot.  However, if I wanted to record a vocal or an acoustic track, I will likely need to get another pair of headphones."}
{"review":"These headphones have been in the sound room of my church for a few years now and it took me until today to notice that they were the little brother to the m50.\n\nI always knew they sounded so nice, but it was confusing because they felt like cheap $10 headphones. It's possible that I have an old model and they've redesigned them but, wow, do these headphones feel cheaply made. Every time I move my head, I can hear the plastic parts rubbing against one another. And after about 20 minutes they get pretty unbearable to wear. The cord is very, very long which can be a good thing or a bad thing. I particularly like it because I can move around in the AV room with them still on.\n\nBut the sound quality is great. Just great, though. I can tell they're very clear even though my church doesn't have the 'cleanest' setup as I can constantly hear some white noise. I love when our speaker has a nice voice because I will just sit and listen through these phones, but of course the quality is bottlenecked by a discontinued Audio Technica gooseneck mic about double the price of these.\n\nMy conclusion is that these are good for the price but I would never recommend them because of how uncomfortable they are. If you need monitoring headphones I would recommend their big brother the m50. The price is much higher, but they're much better made, much, much more comfortable, and the sound quality is significantly better. If you just want good listening headphones for cheap, I would recommend Razer Electras; astounding audio quality for their price, and the absolute most comfortable headphones I have worn."}
{"review":"Excellent sound for my ears and very comfortable.  They can get a little hot after wearing for a few hours, but they are my favorite so far."}
{"review":"fathers day present that he won't put down. sound is really good and he uses them even for yard work. only problem is the super long cord. he has to have it tapped or its a mess."}
{"review":"I am a huge fan of music and I just now realized that if I want the most out of it I need proper headphone and not Apple EarPods. Since I'm just a teenager with no money to get a premium set of expensive headphones I needed something that wasn't too expensive but sounds great. This is exactly what the ATH-M30's deliver. These have great sound quality and the best I've heard but you also have to take into consideration that most of my headphones are free with the devices I have bought. Looking these up on the internet will bring up results that all seem to point these to be one of the or even the best headphones under $50. If you are an audiophile on a very small budget or just someone who has never spent more then $10 on headphones nothing can beat these for the price."}
{"review":"Beautifully made, the ear cups are excellent, hold firm to the head (comfortably) and the sound is fantastic. Great for tuning out the world, very little sound can be heard when wearing. Super long cord (which hangs from left side only,) allows the listener to lean back from music source or computer.  We bought 2, a rare LOVE IT product!"}
{"review":"Frankly the best audio headphones ever.  I have to admit I am an audio snob, so I love good sound for both spoken and tunes.  I wear headphones all day at work everyday.  These are comfortable and the sound quality is outstanding.  Beet my Sony monitors hands-down.  I plan to buy a second pair for home too!"}
{"review":"So far, so good.  Impressed with the flat, unaltered sound and good noise isolation.  Quality seems good enough to last as long as you don't abuse them.  Definitely a great value."}
{"review":"Love the headphones.  Fit comfortably!  Now I can listen to my music as loud as I want and do not have to worry about bothering anyone in the home"}
{"review":"An excellent product! One of the first things I noticed was the heavier cord as compared to other brands for this price. The headphones were comfortable.  They completely covered my ears.  I could easily wear these for hours with no discomfort. The sound was incredible; I could hear every note and tone.  I was able to hear notes and tones in songs I never knew were there.  The only complaint I have is that the cord was a bit too long (10 feet) for me.  However, that might not be an issue for some.  If you are looking for a high quality headphone without the high quality price, this headphone is for you.  Its an excellent product for the money!"}
{"review":"It is comfortable designed, but the sound quality is weak, especially using my ipod. There is no oomph to the sound. Maybe it works better on an amplified sound system. But on the ipod, there is nothing redeeming about its sound quality."}
{"review":"The sound is very clear and I love this headset because I can walk around the house or cook in the kitchen with it on and I can still listen to the news."}
{"review":"Since my neighbors love my guitar so much I felt that I needed something like this. After some research I settled on this item. It is exactly as described and quite professional in quality."}
{"review":"Amazing sound quality, the best studio headphones I've found for under 100 dollars. 4 Stars because they can be painful to wear for extended periods. If you're using them mainly for music productions, then these are the perfect choice."}
{"review":"The cord connecting headphone to the machine is too bulky, not comfortable if you only uses this in office or at home for simple purpose."}
{"review":"These are great heaphones as advertised; professional studio microphones.  I can now hear my voice going to the microphone through these headphones.  If you want to set up a home studio, I recommend buying all the items that I purchased.  So far, I selected well.  I need nothing further."}
{"review":"Great headphones! This is good quality. I enjoy using them now. They sit more comfortably on my ears compared to my last studio headphones. If you're looking for great headphones for a great price, look no further."}
{"review":"These are very comfortable Headphones.  I am not usually a fan of headphones but these do not have a ton of pressure on the sides and the cushions are great."}
{"review":"Sound quality is good.  However the plastic crackles and rubs against itself as you move, so you can hear that. Annoying but not a deal breaker for me."}
{"review":"I loved it until the right earphone just went dead on me. Up until then the sound was absolutely gorgeous and for the price it was unbeatable. I just wish I didn't have this misfortune happen to me.\n\n10\/10 would buy again though but not anytime soon."}
{"review":"I got this for a friend who had a fierce fear of storms. Now she can listen to music comfortably without the thunder being so intense."}
{"review":"The sound quality is great and I love that there is only a single cord. It makes things so much easier. A fantastic product for the price...completely satisfied!!!"}
{"review":"Pretty great headphones. I'm not really an audiophile or anything like that, so I didn't really know what to look for in a pair of headphones. But I had a job involving audio\/video this summer, and figured it wouldn't hurt to get myself something better than cheap earbuds. The sound in these is great for the average person, I'd say -- I can't speak for professionals in audio engineering or similar fields, aka people who would know better.\n\nMy only issue so far has been the headphone jack. It fit perfectly into various products I've used this summer -- soundboards, a Tricaster Studio, my Galaxy SIII... but the fit is very, very iffy when plugging into my laptop. If I move around too much I find that I sometimes have to plug them back in or even adjust the angle to get sound. I'm not sure if anyone else has had a similar issue, but I'd love to get suggestions on what I can do about this. Like I said, the sound quality has been great. I just don't want the issue of not being able to fit them in my computer to ruin the experience."}
{"review":"Highs and Lows are excellent.  Enough power to blow your ear drum!  Very comfortable even with big ears.  These headphones are phenomenal for less than $45.00.  Glad I purchased them."}
{"review":"I bought these headphones in mid-April, and after 3 months of medium to heavy use they are already done for. The cable broke somewhere near the jack, so now music will only come through when I hold the cable at a certain angle. SUPER annoying. I owned a pair of Phillip's O'Neill headphones before these ones and this happened several times, but at least I could replace the cable. Not an option with these headphones, so I guess that's that. Pretty disappointed, especially considering how many reviewers say these are really durable. Boo :("}
{"review":"Excellent. Sound quality is very good with little bias for consumer tastes. I use these in studio situations for monitoring and listening to music. If you mixing sound, you will likely not be using sub $50 headphones, but  if you were, I these would be a good choice. Audio Technica has kept their blend of quality and price at an excellent ratio. I also own a number of other AT equipment. All of which serve reliably.\n\nThese are very comfortable, with an excellent long cable and it comes with a .25\"\/.125\" adapter.\n\nThe over ear is also nice and quiet. While not noise canceling, isolation is very good. I recommend these without reservation."}
{"review":"Great sound. Cord isn't as long as I expected. They do hurt my ears if I wear them for too long but they don't bother my spouse's ears."}
{"review":"Only used once but so far it does its job.  You can hear some louder sounds through the phones but for the kiddos it works fine.  we have bought other high end phones before but these seem to clear out the noise enough to make me happy"}
{"review":"These earphones are not great. But when I record something that has a full, balanced sound using a nice Rode mic, and listening to the recording on these sounds reasonably close to it.\n\nAfter paying nearly twice as much for Sony MDR7506 as I did for the Audio-Technica ATH-M30, I really, really wanted those to be better. And while the latter certainly doesn't produce what I would call great sound, the former sounds like a step downward in quality.\n\nThese earphones sound better -- more balanced and natural -- than the comparable \"reference\" model from Sony. Ouch. For my money, these are more than adequate."}
{"review":"Works exactly as described. No complaints at all. Would happily order this again. Better sound quality that I expected. This is easily the best pair of headphones I've ever owned."}
{"review":"The sound quality on these are decent, especially considering the price. However, the jack itself seems to be rather fragile. A couple of months after purchasing these, the jack began to only work at particular wired angles, and eventually lost sound completely."}
{"review":"Very nice pair of headphones. For the price, the quality is undeniably excellent. The only complaint is that if I try and attach it to any device that has a case (like my tablet), I have to remove the case because the jack is weirdly designed such that it won't fit completely into the port. So I have to remove the case and plug it in completely."}
{"review":"Ehh.\n\nI read on Cnet reviews that these headphones have \"good bass\", which is why I bought them. I understand that these are considered an inexpensive pair of headphones, but I would greatly disagree with the term \"good bass\". At best I would say that these headphones have \"some bass\". They are very clear sounding and everything but the bass is \"good\". They may be the best headphones that you can buy for the money, but they do not have \"good bass\"."}
{"review":"These headphones do a great job of canceling sound and highlighting the finer details of sound. For the price, I couldn't be happier with this purchase!"}
{"review":"These headphones are fantastic. Great sound and pretty comfy, too. I use them at work (I work in an open office layout) to drown out the noise around me and they do surprisingly well. For the money, I'm not sure they can be beat. They do tend to make my ears sore if I wear them too long, but it's a minor annoyance that I can live with."}
{"review":"These headphones are great. Good build, good sound overall, great for djing\n\nUpdate: Been a couple years now and these things are still working great.  Audio Technica is a great brand, still loving them!"}
{"review":"Let me say that I am not an audiophile and I purchased these prior to a 13 hour plane ride for the sole purpose of traveling.  The reviews were good and the description indicated they provided sound isolation.  I looked at \"noise cancelling\" models but in the lower price range the reviews were really inconsistent.\nWhen I received the headphones (two days prior to travel) I was concerned.  They didn't block out the noise of my air conditioner but it was too late to try another option.\nThey do not block out the engine noise of the plane (dull whirring) but I was unable to hear conversations from people around me and had to take them off to hear what the person in the next seat was saying to me.  I was very impressed and it allowed for movie watching without distractions.\nThey are also EXTREMELY comfortable.  My BF has a pair of very high-end headphones which provide complete sound isolation but wearing them for more than an hour or two leaves me with sore ears.  I wore these for almost the entire 13 hour flight both ways.\nI found the sound quality to be excellent but to be fair I'm comparing them to my 20$ Sony earbuds so that assessment should be taken with a grain of salt.  For the price they did exactly what I needed while being very comfortable.  Glad I purchased them and would definitely recommend them to others."}
{"review":"Outperforms many headphones that are twice the price. The construction isn't as sturdy as I'd like, being plastic, but you can't beat the price. They provide clear, rich sound, deep and defined bass. The M30's are comfortable to wear, and light. They don't have an overbearing attribute to them. For example, I've noticed beats by dre headphones have over-dominant bass. While I like bass as much as anyone, I like being able to hear the other elements of whatever track I'm listening to. Not very portable, as the long cord can snag on things and that can be annoying at times If I don't have half of it rolled up and tied off. Though, that's not it's primary purpose being studio headphones, and all. Pretty happy with them overall."}
{"review":"I love them, they have the best sound! They are also so soft on my ears and block out any outside noise and come with a very long cable which is very handy to me when I'm listening to music and trying to do other things as well!!"}
{"review":"very happy with these -- they have great sound a LONG cord and have lasted me a year so far of heavy use - I wish the top over the head adjustment would go just a little smaller .. but they are still fine - would buy again."}
{"review":"Despite the dubious packaging, inside contains a very enjoyable set of headphones.  The general design, having nothing unecessary or too conspicuous, is very appealing to me.  It has a comfortable grip around the head, not too much or too little compression, and in my case fits perfectly; the metal material used to clamp feels very strong and unlikely to bend or break.  The headphones themselves easily rotate 180 degrees and cancel out a noticeable amount of external sound.  The cable is extremely long and may not be ideal for someone wanting to use them publicly or on the go (might make for some awkward situations if you get someone tangled); the adapter that would go into whatever mobile device's port is equally enormous, though of nice quality (gold-plated connector and a spiral metal thingy behind it which is supposed to help prevent tears).  Not being too technical, the sound is moderate in frequency without any imbalances between bass and treble; nothing extraordinarily bad or good about the sound quality."}
{"review":"They're so awesome; the sound quality is so good, I can hear things in songs I've listened to for years, but never heard before. They're also very, very comfortable, and the cord is not only thick, but very flexible, so it never takes on a \"shape\" from being bent."}
{"review":"Not an audiophile but I find these headphones to be very good and they have a nice balanced range. Best of all the customer service for AT is amazing! I shipped them my headphones with a snapped and dangling ear, and they repaired it no problem. I really respect the brand."}
{"review":"They're good headphones. Excellent for the price and from a good name in audio equipment.\n\nPros:\nNever clip\n12 foot cord (if you need it)\nBest 3.5mm Jack on the face of the planet.\nComfortable on top of my head\nComfortable for the first hour or so\nBargain\nThe look much better than most pairs of headphones. Honest and simple design.\n\nCons:\nSound quality lacks deep bass and some mids\nThe 12 foot cord constantly gets in the way\nIf you're producing with these, you'll end up with a small sounding track, lacking in true bass and high-frequency fidelity"}
{"review":"I love to really hear my music and these babies allow me to do just that without blasting my wife out of the house or making my ears bleed."}
{"review":"Nice sounding headphones, nearly studio quality.  Sits comfortably over my head and ears don't sweat.  Sound quality is really outstanding.\n\nUpdate: 4\/8\/2016 These are still sounding great. Use them almost every night to watch TV after wife falls asleep.  Comfortable even on the pillow. Audio is warm, clear, and crisp.  Also use them for listening to Shortwave Radio. Pretty versatile."}
{"review":"Loved the sound of quality on these headphones and had a long cable which is a must for radio station use. I wear this a lot during the day and were really comfy on the ears."}
{"review":"These are about as good as I have ever experienced. They block out all extraneous noise to allow their superb performance to pass without interference."}
{"review":"I'm not an audiophile but these things sound pretty good to me. I have nothing bad to say about them. They have already outlasted my 300 dollar pair of Bose headphones. Good sound, Sturdy, comfortable and relatively cheap. I don't think you can do better at this price point."}
{"review":"Right out of the box these sound fantastic!  Well worth the price. I had a set of grados for years and I don't remember them sounding better than this and they weren't cheap. Jammin out to some great classic tunes and each one is sounding better! Don't hesitate if your looking for some nice headphones at a steal of a price."}
{"review":"Worthless garbage. Some $20 Skull Candy earbuds have way better sound quality. These clunky Audio-Technica ATH-M30 head phones also broke not long after getting them so they were not as durable as I originally either. Don't waste your money."}
{"review":"I'm a radio professional upgrading my home studio, and after getting a good board and microphone, I realized the headphones I had weren't going to cut it. I spent some time on Amazon searching out my options, and found the Audio Technica ATH-M30 almost by mistake. These are great headphones. They feel and fit very much like the Sony headphones many studios use. I think the sound is also comparable. I don't have any concerns about durability, either.\n\nI'm very happy with my purchase, and I'm amazed that I could find headphones of this quality at this price point."}
{"review":"Very good bass, and clear. I would have rated it five stars, but these are very uncomfortable, they fit perfectly on my head and I am thirteen, but these can be adjusted. The problem is they are very tight on my head, or maybe its the little cushioning, but because of it my ears would hurt by the pressure"}
{"review":"These are pretty good headphones sound quality wise, however after several minutes of wearing them I find them uncomfortable. I think the ear pieces are not big enough as they will not fit entirely over my ear so after a while of smashing my ear against my skull it becomes uncomfortable. The alternative of bending my ear inside turns out to be just as uncomfortable after a while. 3 stars for not being able to wear very long."}
{"review":"They sound great, and have lasted me a long time. I've dropped and stepped on them a few times so they are durable as well. Only issue is the 11 foot cord, which I keep wrapped up mostly, with about four feet loose. I use them for listening to my music from a laptop, so they work well. Also used to wear them walking to class, and they worked well to keep out the noise of the cars going by so I could enjoy the walk."}
{"review":"I really liked these. They sounded great and the cord was plenty long. I just wish they had a harder bass. Im sure the bass is perfect for the large majority of people but I like it to bump and I wanted to try out another pair instead. I haven't yet found what Im looking for and am considering buying these again because they are great at this price point."}
{"review":"I bought these because of the price and the number of good reviews. The other reviewer were not lying, these are very high quality headphones. I have tried many different types of headphones and these are the best. The sound quality is awesome and the comfort is great. These headphones allow you to hear sounds that I have never heard before on records. Definitely worth purchasing."}
{"review":"I am wearing these headphones right now, and I have to admit that I am mostly impressed with them. Sound quality is phenomenal for the price, and they feel amazing. My only complaint is that if  you wear them for extended periods (<2 hour) they will make your actual ears hurt like you wouldn't believe from the constant pressure."}
{"review":"My headphones arrived very promptly, and they work great for the price paid. The cord is nice and long ( and durable), the sound is pretty decent, and they are comfortable"}
{"review":"The sound quality is fantastic, not as good as my Bose QC15, but also not nearly the cost.\n\nI was very impressed with the sound quality. Pretty close to the Bose in my opinion.\nBut I work in a loud office environment and these didn't quite block out enough for me. In a quieter environment, or even in a busy environment these would have been perfect for me.\n\nYour ears do get a bit warm\/sweaty due to the full enclosure. The Bose do seem a bit better for that, but can't say that with 100% confidence.\n\nIf you want to spend sub $100, you'd be hard pressed to find better headphones."}
{"review":"The headset is comfortable with very good sound quality.  The cord is extra long, made of none tangle heavy material and with a high quality plug in."}
{"review":"I know, I know the description doesn't say they are - but when I did a search for \"noise cancelling headphones\" this was literally the number 1 hit!  Today its the number 4 hit.  It was late and I didn't look closely, so I hit order.\n\nI am sure these are great headphones, the build looks good, the wiring is solid - but WHY does this come up as the #1 or #4 hit for a search on \"noise cancelling headphones\". :-("}
{"review":"These are some awesome headphones, and have been put to hundreds of hours of use now. I bought them about 2 years ago, and was looking for a pair of potentially new headphones and stumbled across these and decided I should give them a review. My headphones still give crisp and clear audio, the audio quality hasn't gone down at all.\n\nI take 1 star off because of comfort. After enough use (I'd say about a year of nearly daily use) the cushioning on the ear cups becomes so soft that it is effectively no use. These headphones have some good tension holding the ear cups together, enough that with inadequate padding, and 3-4 hours of use they cause the tops of my ears to hurt.\n\nSuper comfy up till the padding became too squishy. For about a year they are 5 star quality, after that expect a bit of suffering with extended use, but continually excellent audio quality. Not much bass if you like that, but I didn't buy these wanting a banging headset, I wanted good, clear sounding audio. I used them for audio editing in school initially, then work, replaced them at work with a pair of ATH-M50's and use these around the house now. Great buy, 100% satisfied, I am having the same comfort issue with my M50's for marginally better audio quality so I am more satisfied with these than those honestly."}
{"review":"These have been replaced by the \"new\" ATHM30 \"X\" model....The only difference in the \"new ones\" is the \"X\". Now you can get THESE for roughly HALF the price. They sound great. Do ALL the things good headphones do very well...They have GOOD cables. Not those \"ear bud wires\" that break. And very nice plug adaptors that screw on and feel like a REAL plug. And \"feel\" IS important!!! Buy these WHILE YOU CAN!!!"}
{"review":"I'm not an audiophile.  To me these headphones sound better than anything I've ever owned.  I mostly use them with the multi-effects processor on my guitar so  don't wake the neighbors.  Works pretty good."}
{"review":"Sound Quality: 6\/10\nOutput: 4\/10\nComfort: 6\/10\n\nWouldn't be disappointing if they were $20 but at double the price they're just a little lacking. Sound is poor for the price, the output is pretty terrible, noise canceling is non-existent which adds to the output problem and maybe I have dumbo ears but they barely cover my ears.\n\nI prefer my cheap $9 Panasonic earbuds over these in every way."}
{"review":"I wish I had upgraded to the actual noise cancelling headphones. I can still hear my wife asking me questions about dishes, litter box, taking the garbage out..."}
{"review":"I am well pleased with the ATH-M30 headphones. I'm hearing instruments and vocals in the songs that i didn't know were there before. Much better sound with these than the cheap over the ear Radio Shack headphones i had been using. With the ATH-M30's i get a much clearer sound with good high, mid-range and bass. The 11 ft cable is a plus for me, it's just the right length from my stereo, to where i sit when i'm listening."}
{"review":"Audio-Technica has a good reputation and I figured even for a $50 set of ATH-M30s they would perform better than average. My wife has a pair of Sony over the ear headphones that I paid $40 or $50 for and they are far superior to the ATH-M30s. The A-Ts sound ok, but just \"ok\" isn't good enough. They sound fuzzy through the midrange and lack any sort of bottom end. They sounded marginally better after about 200 hours of burn-in time, but again, I expected a lot more. I'll be handing these down to my 11 year old and investing in a pair of Monsters before too long."}
{"review":"I purchased these so I could drown out the noise in my office and concentrate on my work. They do the job beautifully. Definitely a great option for anyone who wants Boise or Beats, but without the price tag.\n\nUnfortunately, they don't work in my iPhone; but, since that wasn't the reason I purchased them, it wasn't a big deal."}
{"review":"Aside from my Grado labs headphones, these are my favorites.\nThe sound is perfect. These are worth three times as much money at least.\nIncredible value."}
{"review":"My daughter loves them. I brought them for my 16 year old daughter and she loves them. She said they are loud enough and she hasn't had any problems with them since she go them"}
{"review":"These are so popular I really thought they would be better.\n\nMy first issue is that they did not fit my ears properly, the pads are too thin and they squeezed my ears, which caused them to become very uncomfortable after about 45-60mins. I tried adjusting them every which way but It seems I needed to modify the pads.\n\nMy second issue is that the right speaker completely stopped working after about 3 months of very light use. I never put them too loud and never dropped them. They sat on my head or my desk always. Really sucks to have them die out so quickly.\n\nSound quality wise these are OK. They definitely were detailed and quick accurate, but they definitely lacked the sound quality I expected. They also were very anemic in the bass department, it was almost non-existent.\n\nI now use the Sennheiser HD-360 (in the link) and enjoy them much much more. Very comfortable, better sounding, and cheaper.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00I0SCD72\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00I0SCD72&linkCode=as2&tag=nealo10a-20&linkId=Q52NQGHSMAOFG5XH"}
{"review":"After using exclusively Sennheiser headphones for years -- I currently use a pair of well-worn HD555s at home -- I wanted to try something different.  These are intended to be used in cube-land at work, so I wanted something closed-back so as not to disturb my coworkers.  Compared to my 555s, certainly more bass-heavy, and the stereo separation is more pronounced.  Midrange is good, but higher frequencies are slightly muted.  It's not bad, just different.  On the whole, they sound fantastic, especially considering how cheap they are.  My only issue is that for a Sennheiser, \"over the ear\" means \"over the ear\" -- these just barely qualify as such.  They're not quite on-ear, either -- to be honest somewhere in the middle.  Bottom line: phenomenal value."}
{"review":"Saw a review of these headphones on CNET. Ordered a pair for myself and really like them. Great sound. Buy theses you will not be disappointed."}
{"review":"for $40 bucks they deliver great sound and quite comfortable in my ears.\nI can work in the computer all night without bothering anyone around.\nand you don't need expensive... you know, those on \"sale\" for $100.\n\n3 more words required:  Blah, blah, blah."}
{"review":"Great sound, great price. I use these at work where I sit in a cubicle. They do a great job canceling noise and the music sounds awesome. No need to spend the extra bucks on Bose or other fancy brands."}
{"review":"These sound excellent for this price range, better if you use an amplifier (I use a Fiio E11).  As with many closed back headphones they can make your ears sweat in warm weather.  My only complaint is they fit too tight (I don't have a big head 7 1\/4\").  This is a common problem with a lot of headphones.  Don't the people who design these try them on?  Why can't so many manufacturers get this right???  I ended up giving these to a friend for there son to use. I can recommend these only if you \"try before you buy\"."}
{"review":"bass hits you like you are in a completely new world..with all the bass, mids and treble neatly balanced you can hear crystal clear sound of each instrument being played in the song...."}
{"review":"Only part I didn't like about these headphones is that the cord is very long. BUT THE SOUND! A must when studying in a crowded area."}
{"review":"Sounds as good as my Sennheisers which cost a lot more and I had to throw away in less than a year due to their thin flimsy cable. failing after getting snagged on  everything  (shirt buttons!)  The ATH-M30 has a long and thick cable with a coiled spring stress relief at  the plug.  4 stars only because not as comfortable as I would  Iike when wearing my eyeglasses, -- too much pressure where my glasses go over my ears,  but that could just be  my particular eyeglass frame  and ear shape."}
{"review":"For the price you can not get a better sounding over the ear experience. Are there better phones, of course, but anyone who listens to music will have multiple headsets, because there is no perfect pair of anything, but these are wonderful & comfortable. My only complaint was I wish it had a cable management system."}
{"review":"Got these when they went on sale.  I'm so happy I did.  For recording they sound loud and full.  And they're very detailed so I can pick out little annoyances from my mixes.  Buy these!"}
{"review":"Perfect for my setups at Church for the voice and also for the instruments and vocalists. Good clean, crisp sound and comfortable on my ears and head. Nice long cord gives me the ability to sit back after the controls adjustments and continue to monitor without standing."}
{"review":"Replaced some older cheaper headphones which were accidentally damaged and had some higher expectations for these which were a little more expensive. But think they were roughly the same in quality with the older headphones maybe a little bit better, and not sure why. But like them, and use them a lot, which is what really matters."}
{"review":"i use this with my studio and i really like it. i wish i would of bought the cordless new ones but i didn't look into it but still decent and really recommend all it is a cord treat it like gold and keep jamming"}
{"review":"The sound is well-balanced and the extra length on the headphone cord is fantastic for reaching my plug-in port on my work computer. Great deal."}
{"review":"The head phones work very good with my lap top the volume is so much louder than the laptop or even cheap head phones also it cancels out any other sound around you very happy with them."}
{"review":"Purchased in July 2012 and until now worked great. One of the speakers blew. Now this could have been my fault - like to listen to music kind of loud. If the price point is with in your budget, I would try these - just not loud"}
{"review":"my \"search\" was for \"noise canceling\" headphones.  these came up as item #2.  I already own a pair of Audio-technica noise canceling headphones, and thought these were the same model, just discontinued, and price reduced.  so much for thinking.  these are fine headphones, just not NC."}
{"review":"Went to a Hollywood recording studio and noticed they had these in there recoding booth. Thought if they had these they must be decent enough, searched them up & they were a good price."}
{"review":"My second pair.\nMy dog chewed the wire on my first pair.\nMy old ears don't need the really expensive types.\nI use them to listen to the music on my I phone and Sansa device.\nVery happy with them."}
{"review":"The padding around the ear is not deep enough and it ends up pressing hard on my ears. After a while they start to get really uncomfortable and I have to take them off. Sad because I like everything else about them. The sound is great with powerful bass, they block quite a bit of environmental sounds, they have a very long cable which allows me to route them through the back of my desk from my computer, and they seem to be very sturdy, but if I can't wear them for more than 1\/2 hour, what's the point? I have a pair of Sony MDR-XD200 at home which don't sound as good, but they are very light and comfortable to wear.\n\n*Update*: After wearing them for a couple of weeks my ears have gotten more used to their shape. I can now wear them for a couple of hours, so I'm bumping up a star in my review. They still bother me if I wear them all day long.\n\n*Update 2*: I went ahead and bent open the metal frame of the headphones (I pretty much bent it past the flat point) and now they don't press so hard against my ears. They feel MUCH more comfortable and I can wear them much longer. I'm bumping up another star"}
{"review":"I bought these headphones as a replacement for set of BOSE TP-1 headphones that were broken off at the earpiece. These headphones have better noise reduction and better sound quality than the Bose at 1\/5 of the price.\nI will never again purchase Bose headphones. I realize now I waste a lot of money buying a name."}
{"review":"I got these on sale, and I have been very pleased with them since then.  Excellent response in bass in treble and respectable durability.  The design fits my oversized cranium just fine, and the ear cups are comfortable and a good fit.  The cord is of reason strength, with a reinforced plug."}
{"review":"I'm no audiophile, needed a decent pair of headphones and for that these work great. Very happy with it. Would buy them again if i had to."}
{"review":"There are many better headphones out there. But I cannot hear the difference anymore. So these are good. Not too heavy. Large pads fit conviniently over my ears. Sound is clear. Bass is not super impressive but what you expect from basic headphones. I like the wire and the adapter. Very well made."}
{"review":"These headphones are made well and sound great. They feel very comfortable and look good. A srcew on 1\/4 inch adaptor is included. The sound is balanced between lows, mids, and highs. They have a clear, deep bass tone like Aiwa headphones. If I needed to , I would buy them again."}
{"review":"These are solid, reliables workhorses.  There are plenty of flashier headphones out there, but few that sound this good for this price.  My only complaint is that the housing around the jack is quite bulky and so I can't plug it into my iPad with the case I'm using."}
{"review":"The stuff about hearing sounds you never heard before when listening to heavily instrumental music? It's True.\n\nThe stuff about how comfortable they are? Also True.\n\nThe cord is long enough to walk around without having to take your device with you?  Yep!\n\nI love these headphones. I'm sure there is something greater out there, but they are phenomenal for the price. We have a train right behind our house that comes barreling through several times an hour... I can't even hear it with these things on. It's helpful for blocking out the television or noisy kids when I'm studying for school. You CAN hear them if they need you... but I'll not tell them that. ;-)"}
{"review":"This headset is the best I have had and I have had lots of them (they break after awhile). Very sturdy and easy to use. I use them with my portable DVD player so I use the thinner of the 2 parts that plug in (it come with 2 sizes). My ears are covered completely and comfortably, the sound quality is good. The product was delivered on time and was packed well. I recommend this product and the seller."}
{"review":"I am not an audiophile, but it sounds great to me!  I use it to practice on my stage piano in my apartment, the amp gets too loud sometimes and I don't want to disturb my neighbors.  It covers up a lot of ambient noise in your room so you hear mostly what is being sent through the speakers.  It may feel flimsy but if you take proper care of it, it will be great."}
{"review":"I enjoy the sound quality of this headphone. However, I travel a lot and this one is bulky in my suitcase. I have also a Koss headphone that can be folded into a small item."}
{"review":"Excellent product at a great price....awesome sound. I prefer to listen to songs using my headset however the sound is so good that I use it for movies as well"}
{"review":"The headphones have pretty good sound quality, but the fit is pretty tight, so it can be tough to wear them for extended periods of time."}
{"review":"Esp. for the price.  The extra long cord is really useful.  My only issue is that the volume seems to max out.  They just aren't as loud as some other headphones I have.  The noise suppression is wonderful, though, as is the comfort."}
{"review":"These are great for the money, nice sound and clarity, however, spend a few more bucks ($50) and get ones made by Sennhieser.  They have much better instrumental sound."}
{"review":"These are the best headphones I've ever had for this price. I like them much better than Beats. I'm home-recording music with these and so far the results have been great, my mixes are turning out perfect. I will definitely buy these again when they need to be replaced. They're comfortable too! Crisp treble, decent mid-range, and bass that sounds lovely but not overwhelming: Perfect headphones for my needs."}
{"review":"When I'm wearing these, I keep finding myself taking off my earphones to make sure that the sounds I'm hearing are coming from the computer, and not my house.  If that's the kind of experience you want, these do it for not too expensive."}
{"review":"I manly use these when walking on a treadmill and my wife is watching TV. Plug it into my MP3 player and it blocks most of the TV sound. Very pleased. The ear-pads are very comfortable and almost completely cover my ears."}
{"review":"I am not a guru when it come to headphones. I do like the sound quality and the flip able ear pieces for 1 eared listing and how the 3\/8 to 1\/4 is a screw on so it doesn't come apart. My only concern is at that same spot it seams like it has the ability not to put too much tension on that bend when it goes into my mixer but I do find it cuts out unless I keep the cord a certain way. It may of been me I am pretty hard on my equipment but I feel it is a concern."}
{"review":"Good dang for buck! Cord was a little to long though and after a while it got uncomfortable when listening to music for long periods of time"}
{"review":"A little over a year ago, I decided I should get a nice semi-expensive set of headphones just to see the difference in both quality and how long they last. Disappointed. A friend of mine suggested that I give these Audio-Technica ones a try. I was surprised both with comfort AND better audio quality than my SRH500DJ's. If these break (Cause I use headphones DAILY, for 6-8 hour gaming sessions) at least they're affordable enough to replace, and they don't hurt my ears even after prolonged use. Thumbs up."}
{"review":"I love that it comes with the adapter for smaller jacks. My daughter can use it with her phone and I don't have to listen to her music. The cord is extra long which is an added bonus. The only drawback is she can drown out when I'm calling for her to do her chores, they are that good at cancelling outside noise. I need to borrow them from her when she's ranting :)"}
{"review":"They look fine, feel fine, sound fine.  I will probably get another pair or two for my home studio.\n\nShipping was quick. Works as it should. I have nothing bad to say. In fact, I would order again from this seller."}
{"review":"For the money (I purchased mine on sale from Amazon for under $50.00), these headphones are wonderful. Crisp highs and substantial bass. I have no idea where they rank in the world of \"studio monitor\" headphones, but for listening to MP3s when you want the comfort and solitude of a over-the-ear phone, they are pretty dang satisfactory."}
{"review":"I do not like the headphones as they are uncomfortable when used for a period of time. The headphones were recommended to me, but I will have to keep looking for a reasonable set that I can wear at least 4-6 hours without my hears burning."}
{"review":"I was looking for a set of Bluetooth headphones for use with my Android tablet that I received for Christmas, but after trying a few that were owned by friends I felt that the sound quality and isolation was not very good. My son recommended these AT cans which he uses on his mixing board. I noted that they came with a long cord and have both 1\/8 and 1\/4 inch plugs, so I could plug into my tablet as well as my older Denon receiver. I'm no audiophile, but cranking the Denon to the max with no input is dead silent  through the speakers as well as these cans. Isolation is very good though not total, and they are light and very comfortable to wear. At this price point they really can't be beat, and I am very happy with the purchase"}
{"review":"After trying earbuds that didn't work for me, I ordered these headphones.  They are great and I would recommend them for both comfort and clarity.  However, I only use these for audiobooks, usually in the car on road trips.  They are super comfortable and my ears don't hurt like they did with earbuds."}
{"review":"These headphones are the best you can buy for under $100. You don't have to blast your music to drown out surrounding ambient noise. Truly a great buy!"}
{"review":"Disclaimer- I am not an \"audiophile\" and I did not purchase these for professional use.  These headphones are lightweight, extremely comfortable and provide very clear sound.  I was extremely surprised at how well they block outside noises.  I was not expecting such noise cancelling ability at this price point- very pleased with no complaints."}
{"review":"Awesome sound! Very immersing. there was a thump in the music, I thought someone hit my wall. I took my ear phones off and found that it just had to do with the music broadcasting through the headphones. Great product. Long cord but you already knew that."}
{"review":"I love these headphones.  I used them last week while riding the tractor to mow the lawn.  With ear buds, I can barely hear the music over the sound of the mower. With these headphones, I had to turn the volume down.  Great purchase"}
{"review":"These headphones keep out as much noise as the average big puffy headphones. I was expecting to be able to block out enough 'neighbor noise' to make the enormous headgear worthwhile. I have never tried the state-of-the--art noise cancelling headphones, so I can't offer a comparison, but if they work like these do, don't bother."}
{"review":"The headphones came quickly, well packaged, and are outstanding.  Very long cord, much more substantial than others I've had; top-notch connectors, with an adapter for plugging into a stereo system's larger plug."}
{"review":"Very clear sounding headphones with bass that is present. Sealed design also takes away some background noise.\n\nI have a big head and not small ears so they were quite tight on my head when new. They have softened up over time and I game them a stretch once or twice so they feel a bit better. The ear cups are partially on-ear for me which doesn't really help. Cord is very long which is a plus to me. They are also quite light weight which is really nice, while not feeling too cheap.\n\nThe small comfort issue is overshadowed by their sound quality and price. Love them, just be aware of the high Ohm rating meaning they have more resistance. They just need a little more power to run well (small amp)."}
{"review":"nice headphones, very comfortable, good sound. Connector is large and does not fit in my ipad with smart cover on, or iphone with case on."}
{"review":"I got these headphones a year ago April and I just bought another pair for my brother this spring.  They have good sound quality, are pretty comfortable and they haven't broken in my backpack over the course of a year which is saying something given how I treat my backpack.  The only complaint is that the material around the ears can get too warm if warn for any length of time.  But given the price I'm really happy with them."}
{"review":"The quality was good enough for me, but I'm not an audiophile so take that with a grain of salt. My only problem was that the headphones were far too quiet. I would have my ipod or laptop on full volume to be able to have a good sound"}
{"review":"These are excellent headphones for the price. Most sounds are crisp and clear in the mids and highs. There's a lot of extra bass, it feels like, which can be good for some kinds of music, although I find the sound to be a little uneven for my tastes. You get a lot of punch and the bass is mostly clear and definitive, it's just that the sound could best be described as \"bottom-heavy.\" Construction is good. These look and feel very durable. A long, thick cord and reinforced jack feel like they will hold up to daily use. The ear cups are snug, without being tight, and look like they could fit a variety of sizes. Cushioned headband and fully adjustable. These were comfortable during long wear without any pressure, but still adjusted to fit securely. Overall, an excellent value, especially for the price at which I purchased them ($39) though I may still need another set of headphones with less bass for other uses."}
{"review":"I considered these despite the given that headphones like these increase the temperature around your ears, perhaps making them more uncomfortable to wear than one might've wished for, but that's not really a terrible problem.\n\nWhat I really cannot bear about these headphones is that I cannot wear them for prolonged amounts of time, otherwise, the pressure begins to crush my ears in a subtle, but harsh way. I have attempted to readjust them, but no matter how hard I try to enjoy the sound from them, the overall pressure from the arch ends with a bit of pain after an hour or two of wearing them.\n\nMaybe they're for small(er) ears, or maybe they're for larger ears. Either way, I find it difficult to tolerate the pressure from these.\n\nEverything else, seems fine to me.\n\nBuy it if you're searching for a pair of headphones under $50 that provides adequate sound for your daily needs. Don't buy it if you have sensitive ears that hurt after wearing over-ear headphones for more than a few hours."}
{"review":"I do a lot of audio recording, audio editing, and transcription work and really needed a set of headphones that can take daily use that blocks out some room noise, gives me good coverage over my ears, and gives me a more true sound without all the darn bass that other headphones add.\n\nI took a chance on these and very glad I did. I like the long cord and the protective spring on the plug side because I messed that up on my last set of headphones.  I am rough on my headphones and my previous set met their demise with the bottom of my office chair.  These seem much sturdier and give me confidence that they will give me quite a bit of use.  I am a petite female and these certainly cover my ears and cancel out quite a bit of room noise (but not all).  They are certainly not hi-fi top of the line, but they do the job and do it well.\n\nThe only issue I have is that they are tight and start to hurt my head after a while, but that is after a few straight hours of use while working."}
{"review":"The sound is great for use with my Kindle while watching video in bed.  The cord should reach from TV to seating for those using it that way.  I'd have given them a 5 but they are a little tight on the head.  I figure the warm ears just goes with the over ears models."}
{"review":"Excellent set of headphones. I use them for my Digital Audio Workstation. The sound is clear and covers the range that the human ear can hear. Especially like the two connectors, 1\/8\" and 1\/4\", that come with the package."}
{"review":"Is this the best sounding headphone you ever heard?  Nope.  However, the sound is super crystal clear and very balance sounding.  The sound is just as clear as my beyerdynamic dt990 minus the soundstage and the bass of course. However, I got this for studio monitoring and it fullfiled that role."}
{"review":"They block out a good bit of outside noise, they are very comfortable, and the sound quality is good. No complaints, they are exactly what I was looking for. The cord is long enough that I don't get whiplash when I reach across my desk."}
{"review":"20Khz to 20Hz sound, nice noise cancellation, made with great quality parts, fits on the head snug and comfortable, and most of all, makes me look like some creepy guy trying to spy on my neighbors. There isn't a single Beats audio headphones that can compete with these 30$ headphones. The Audio-Technica ATH-M30 headphones are simply a great buy for serious professionals."}
{"review":"The first time i put these on I was blown away! The sound quality out of them was absolutely not what I was expecting. Very well rounded sound."}
{"review":"I was truly impressed with how much better my music is with the headset. I bought them to use with brain entrainment. The difference in results is awesome."}
{"review":"Amazing and pure sound. You can hear everything in a sound. Almost perfect noise isolation. The only thing I noticed but I will still test is that it seems to decrease the output volume, compared to others headphones I have."}
{"review":"I had a > $100 pair of headphones from AKG or some brand like that, which produced excellent sound but for some reason the material deteriorated quickly (it's possible that I wasn't taking good care of them).  Regardless, these Audio-Technica headphones produce a sound about on par with them and haven't deteriorated yet."}
{"review":"I'm a  picky person when it comes to audio. I have found over the years what the majority will rate as great sound quality usually is not because most people have never experienced truly great sound quality. So the really good stuff doesn't get the most top reviews because it is usually doesn't get the marketing hype.\n\n Instead you have to know what to listen for to appreciate it, and more often than not the most expensive or most popular item is far from the best. One of my overall tests is when you hear falws in the musician's performances! When you have good sound quality reproduction you often can pick out a slightly muffed-up note or a kicked mike stand that you never noticed before. I use known flaws I've found in recordings to check out new gear.  With \"regular\" quality stuff you will never hear it (because the producer didn't mean for you to hear it) but with really good stuff: there it is! Just as if the musician was perfroming right in front of you. If you know audio stuff you know what I am talking about.\n\nI bought these headphones for outdoor work. I expect to trash them, so I wasn't looking to spend much. I also wasn't expecting superior audio reproduction at this price, but some of the reviews were encouraging so I settled on these.\n\nThe build quality is OK. As mentioned elsewhere the cable is very long. A plus in the old days when your stereo wouldn't fit in your shirt pocket, but a little too much by today's standards.\n\n The ear cups are too small in diamenter to completely cover my ears, which are of very normal size. That is annoying because they are an over the ear design that is defeated if they won't go over your ears. The foam is comfortable enough, nothing fancy.\nThe head band is padded and is comfortable with a good range of adjustment. Sound isolation is moderate to poor.\n\nThe highs notes are a little overdone sounding all hiss and sizzle. The lows are a little muddy. The midrange is unremarkable.\nThe net result is an impression of inexpensive headphones, which these are. I think they are just fine since I didn't pay much for them, but the glowing reviews of their superior sound quality are simply not justified. They are good, not great. Not even close.\n\nI would not buy another pair but that is based more on the lack of fit for my ears and the poor sound isolation, not the modest sound reproduction quality nor the quite adequate build qulaity.\n\nPeter"}
{"review":"Fit comfortably. Mutes outside noise. Great sound for my entertainment system. Now wife can\nsleep in peace when I decide to stay up late and watch TV. :-)"}
{"review":"I work in an IT Department doing application development and bought these because it was very difficult to focus on writing code and building databases with the help desk people taking calls all day and projecting their frustrations after hanging-up. I was a little concerned when I took them out of the box and saw how long the cord was, but it's been very helpful when I want to move around my desk without having to take the headphones off. I was also pleasantly surprised when I used them for the first time because the sound was great! They've also done a good job of keeping my co-workers and boss from interrupting me while I work because the noise canceling works perfectly... almost too good because I do miss a number of calls even with my phone only 2 feet away from me."}
{"review":"Great quality head phones. The best part is the long, stout cord. My daughter likes to wear headphones while she cleans her room and dances and generally moves around, and she has destroyed a couple of pairs already. We have had these for over 6 months and they are not showing the slightest sign of wear. I bought a second pair to give as a gift for my mom, who is a Netflix addict and uses the phones on her computer."}
{"review":"Comfortable, excellent sound.  A good value for the money.  Nice long cord with strain relief on the plug and comes with a mini to quarter adapter."}
{"review":"Got it as a gift, the person liked it, but he says he can't carry it around on his neck because it's quite uncomfortable. Other than that, it seems quite durable, and it's more compact than it looks in the picture, which is a good thing."}
{"review":"I actually really liked the headphones feel and quality relative to the price, but unfortunately they didn't last long before they broke. The sound is now all messed up, it still plays the background noises of songs and parts of games, but it seems like the main track like voices and focal sound doesn't play. Sadly, this is pretty typical of every headphone I've ever purchased from any company, so I don't mean to single out this product, and perhaps I merely was unlucky, I hope other purchasers have a better experience than mine."}
{"review":"This works great for what I need. It's a very low price and it produces a great quality sound. The cord is very long and it allows for movement around a home studio or a room. I'd recommend not wearing them for longer than around 3 hours, however, as they can be pinchy on the ears."}
{"review":"As my daughter had to take a class on a computer, at school, I purchased these.\n\nPros:\nComfortable to wear for 1hr & 40 mins of class .... YES\nPadding on headset blocked out all external noises ... YES\nSound quality is decent ... YES\nCord length is sufficient ... YES\nHas both Computer \/ RCA jack ... YES\n\nCons:\nTruth is .... haven't found any yet  :-)"}
{"review":"I was very new when buying these (for over $50 too not good value at the time either), and I knew very little about sound and the technical specifications, but now I know better. They are only 100db with 65 ohms of impedance, which means they do not get very loud, especially through an MP3 player or other small device. I thought for that much money they would be louder than $15 headphones I've had for over 10 years, but nope. They are fairly durable and comfortable and the sound clarity is fine, but you can get much better bang for your buck with both cheaper and more expensive headphones. Do not pay more than $20 if even considering purchasing these."}
{"review":"they deliver excellent sound quality for the price and seem very sturdy. I bought them as a gift for my teenage daughter.  She is very pleased."}
{"review":"The sound from these head phones are amazing.  My previous ones wore out; wore away all the foam, etc.  it happens when you been using them for 4 or 5 hours a day for last 7 years.  So, they also good lasting."}
{"review":"These headphones have crystal clear highs and mids, but the lows have one flaw (hense the deduction in 1 star): when a low frequency sound plays, it muddles out the highs. I guess this is to be expected of monitor headphones, and I definitely wouldn't put them in the \"professional\" category. The first time I noticed this flaw was when I was playing Halo: Combat Evolved for the PC, when the announcer said \"red team has the flag\" in that classic baritone voice, the high frequencies were momentarily muffled (the ambience and insect noises). I've noticed this in other games as well, but that's the best example I can give for any gamers out there. All in all, as other reviewers have mentioned, these headphones are absolutely the best bang for your buck. But if you're looking for outstanding sound clarity on all frequencies simultaneously, you're going to have to shell out more money on a higher priced set of headphones."}
{"review":"I love these. Good sound for the price. Decent noise reduction for the A train. The cord for them is very long so you'll probably have to tie some of the excess... but if you do so neatly it's no big thing."}
{"review":"I would say the headphones is OK the quality is fine but a bit expensive though, the cable is too long. Wouldnt recommend it do to the high-price and It isn't as comfortable as i thought it would be."}
{"review":"Excellent product, even better than the high profile ones. The built quality and the sound are just clear, punchy and defined. The price it`s even better.\n\nGet them."}
{"review":"I really like these headphones. They are light, block a lot of outside sound and music sounds great through them. They aren't to heavy on the bass, not too bright on the high end. Well balanced sound across the entire range of music."}
{"review":"This is a good headset if you are looking for good sound. I would have wanted it to be better I was a little disappointed because the sound is not the quality I expected it to be. The price was a really good price but it does not deliver the sound that I was looking for. I am keeping them because for the price it is not that bad. Also I find them to be uncomfortable and  the noise cancellation is not that great .The padding around them are not that durable. If you are not looking for excellent sound but just good sound then these could work. Like I said I am keeping them."}
{"review":"Because of the Amazon reviews of these headphones, both my partner and I thought they would offer a good quality product in regards to sound for the price. Not so!  I have been using Shure SRH 4-40 headphones which are wonderful. But I needed another pair and didn't want to spend the extra money for another pair of Shure.  When I received these Audio-Technica ATH-M30 headphones I was shocked and could not bridge the gap between the user reviews and the sound I was hearing. It was a real head-scratchier to me. The sound of the Audio Technica ATH-M30s was flat, condensed, homogenized--not at all crisp and clear or full like the Shure. The highs and lows were missing, the general sound somewhat fuzzy. I feel they'd be adequate for listening to the nightly news, spoken voice, but not music. Both my partner and I were so disappointed that he immediately went out locally and brought home an armful of headphones in this price range from different stores for me to try out.  As it turned out, we didn't have to look beyond the first pair we tried--the Koss UR-40 gave both of us an instant smile factor.  The clarity, comfort, quality and expanded range of sound was so far above the Audio-Technica phones that I immediately sent those back.  Just for my own curiosity I looked up the Koss UR-40 on Amazon. I found Amazon selling a version of the Koss UR-40 for 24.95. The one's I bought were slightly different and I paid 5 dollars more locally for them than they're offered on Amazon (they're different in that the actual ear phone part on mine is more oval, not so round and there is a comfort netting beneath the headstrap on mine where your head meets the head strap making it all that more comfortable).  My partner liked the Koss UR-40 phones so much that he immediately went out and bought himself a pair to use in place of his earbuds to use with His MP3 player while relaxing in the evening.  I hope this review helps someone like myself..  It can be hard buying this type of product without being able to hear it or being able to compare it's quality of sound to that of others."}
{"review":"These headphones are good quality and a great value.  I use them to monitor video editing projects as well as casual music and movie streaming.  Will purchase more of these in the future."}
{"review":"My previous headphones had worn right through the padded ear pieces.  So I made this purchase on advice from a techie friend.  Although the sound quality is not as sharp as my previous set, these headphones were less of an investment and they do give me good quality sound.  They are very user friendly and a good buy for the money."}
{"review":"I'm happy with the sound.  I wish it had a shorter cable and an extension, this is so that listening to my phone wouldn't require carting around all that cable.  They're comfortable and don't press the arms of my eyeglasses into the sides of my head."}
{"review":"I am happily impressed the quality of these head phones..  Clear sound, and the quality of the headphones is great..  It does not feel like they are going to break when I am putting them on..  The cable is long enough that I don't have to be right next to my computer leaning in due to the cord not being long enough.."}
{"review":"These headphones sound great, but I am no audiophile.  I use them exclusively for gaming and I often get a bit too passionate about what I am doing and throw them against the ground.  They show absolutely no signs of wear, and don't appear like they will break any time soon. I will certainly buy these again."}
{"review":"I have been using headphones for 50+ years and have owned many different types. These are comfortable, and a good value. I mostly use them for listening to classical music, and I have had them on for hours at a time with no fatigue or pain issues as I have experienced with other headphones in the past. They are fairly light weight and have a good flat response for a low to mid priced headphone. They don't have as much bass as some but enough to sound realistic. I have spent many hours in the orchestra pit surrounded by fine (and not so fine!) musicians, and these definitely bring back that personal experience feeling."}
{"review":"I got these since they were highly rated and I didn't want to spend too much at the time.  For the price these are really good sounding and I don't think you can find many headphone under $50 that sound as good as these.  I also have some higher priced cans (ATH-M50, MDR-7506, Stax SR34, Senn HD-455, HD-598) and these $39 can will hold their own if using a phone or other similar device.  One thing I would do is change the earpads to either the ATH-M50's or the Beyerdynamic EDT 250 velour, these are much more comfortable."}
{"review":"These are great.  They are really comfortable. The sound is clear with them, I was so surprised to listen to music and hear parts in the background that I have never heard before."}
{"review":"I've had these for about 6 months now and I have to say I love them. I'm no audiophile, just an average listener. I use these with a syba usb dac\/amp at my work desk and it works great. I listen to a wide variety of music but I guess rock\/metal would be the most listened to genre.\n\nthese cans are relatively low impedance 65ohm so powering them is not difficult. I've used them plugged into my android phones and my wife's iphone and they all powered them easily. plugging them into my usb amp\/dac does seem to improve clarity a bit. I'd swear I can hear a bit more detail in my music using the amp\/dac, but it could just be my imagination.\n\namped or not though, these are very very good headphones for the price. clarity is good. highs are crisp and clear, mids also clear but less so, more recessed I'd say. bass is good but not great. if you're used to beats these won't make you happy. but then again these will resolve details in your music that those overhyped beats just cannot. i often find myself going through my music selection listening to stuff i haven't in awhile just to see what new details i'll hear.\n\nas i mentioned, i work in an office so sound leakage is an important issue. thankfully there isn't a lot with these cans. these are closed back, or sealed headphones. this type of can is great for office use as it won't leak much sound out to bother your neighbors.\n\nso if you're an average user that just wants a cheap pair of headphones with great sound quality, give these cans a try, i don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"review":"Let's face it those headphones are not profesional grade for that you will have to spend a lot more money, but for home use they are perfect; lightweight, nice fitting,and good response to listen to the sounds from your computer or mp3 player."}
{"review":"I love the sound... I wish it was more comfortable to keep in my ear for a long time... most of the time i use it during short intervals only so it doesnt bother me a lot... overall to listen to music while studying it is good for me..."}
{"review":"If you used these headphones without knowing the price of them, you'd figure they're worth $80-120 but they are just under $50. Very comfortable (even more so after you break them in) and has an amazing sound; leaving my ears and brain more than satisfied. Pick these up, certainly won't regret it."}
{"review":"If you don't want to pay top dollar for a name brand set of Skullcandy or beats, but want excellent (far better than beats for sure) sound clarity, good highs and lows, and excellent isolation, buy these headphones!"}
{"review":"I love these headphones. The really nice thing they did was put a spring type plug at the end so if someone trips over the wire after too much wine (me) they won't  rip off of the plug tip (the wire)  good buy"}
{"review":"I like to be able to hear the details in the car videos I watch. Great sound helps you really experience the vehicle and connect to what the viewer is rattling on about. These sound like production quality headphones. I can hear the dashboard rattle in the background before the presenter has a chance to complain about it. Its so great being able to REALLy hear the differences in how the voice was recorded. For DIY videos can you really tell if they did the voiceover in a closet or a bathroom with how bad or good the echo is heard.\n\nThese are an amazing bang-for-buck deal."}
{"review":"I got these as a gift for my husband. He really enjoys them. He does his homework with them on and I can watch TV without bothering him. He loves the cord length allows him to stand from his desk to write things on his whiteboard. Sometimes I forget he has them on and carryon a full conversation without him hearing a word."}
{"review":"I use these at work and they really block out the ambient noise around me.  I can still hear some of the chatter around me but they are generally quite effective.  More to the point, these have such great sound!!!!  I am very impressed.  With headphones at this price point, I was not expecting these to deliver such good quality sound.  Great separation, great highs, lows, etc....All good!"}
{"review":"Nice solid feel, the plug is good quality and has wire wrap for strength.  Purchased about 5 months ago and it is holding up well to teenager use.  Great price for this; would buy again."}
{"review":"My hubby loves these headphones. Now he can play his guitar while the kids are sleeping. Which gives him a lot more time in his day."}
{"review":"these works fine only fault is that it is a bit overpriced. Should be at least $70 dollars as other headphones at that price is much better. But I still loved the quality of these headphones and made my music sound good. I recommend these headphones if they were cheaper...Jerry Ayers"}
{"review":"These have good sound and they are very comfortable. My fianc wears them while he works at the computer at home to keep out household distractions."}
{"review":"EXCELLENT. I needed a new headset with full ear coverage and this fit the bill. I was over joyed at the long cable as I move around a lot at my workstation and the standard 6ft cable made for interesting times."}
{"review":"I tested these when they arrived and found the volume to be much softer than I had expected. I checked my phone settings and saw that I had audio set at the lowest level. So, I maximized the volume setting and headed to work. After work, I went to the gym to work out, brought Netflix up on my phone and prepared to stream video while working out. The only problem - I could not hear the video clearly enough to make out the words. I could not believe how week the volume is on these."}
{"review":"Did a lot of research before purchasing, these had great reviews. Honestly, nice headphones but not made for travel. Mine stopped working after only four months. I used them mainly at work but took them home with me everyday. Looks like they just didn't take the wear and tear well. If you are the type of person to throw your headphones into your bookbag for the day these are NOT the right ones for you. If you are looking for solid headphones to use in the studio then these would be a good choice."}
{"review":"I'm a filmmaker and wanted some decent quality headphones to hear the sound I was recording on set and these do the job. They don't cut out outside noise much, but they work for what my intent was. Another positive is that they are very comfortable to wear and the padding is soft and fits very well for your listening pleasure."}
{"review":"I really think these are a best buy. I use them to watch TV and listen to my music from the Amazon cloud. I love the the long cord.\nThe quality is incredible for the price. If something were to happen to these, I would definitely buy another set. I have used them\neveryday for 5 months."}
{"review":"Bought these for my husband and he loves them.  We share an office so he was looking for a good quality set of headphones that didn't cost Bose prices to tune me out.  These do the trick and have great sound quality for the price.  If you are an audiophile with a very discerning ear, you should probably stick with Bose but otherwise save yourself some dough and go with these bad boys."}
{"review":"I am not an audiophile but I enjoy good audio and I certainly enjoy good music.  For the price, these headphones really deliver.  Great value.  Very comfortable even with extended use.  Designed to fit over the ears and not mash the ears and the padding is thick and soft. Quality sound when playing music on my laptop."}
{"review":"Maybe my computer doesn't have enough juice to push these, but I usually have my sound turned ALL THE WAY UP when I watch movies.\nOtherwise, these are comfortable and have good bass response."}
{"review":"High quality and very durable! Sound amazing! Would definitely order them for others in my family and so much cheaper than other similar quality headphones."}
{"review":"I got this exclusively to sample recording tracks but like them so much I now use them almost exclusively. Note: they don\"t block much exterior sound"}
{"review":"I have owned several pairs of over-ear headphones, but these have the best sound by far. I got this product on sale for $40 and it's some of the best money I've ever spent. The sound is nuanced, detailed, and textured, and padding on the earpieces provides for excellent comfort as well as acoustic isolation. Great quality for the price, highly recommended. Extremely happy with my purchase."}
{"review":"Looking for an outstanding set of headphones for both Television \/ DVD and Music then you can't get better for the sound and the money. I directly compared them to a set of Grado SR60i that have been top dog in this price bracket for some time and I'm pleased to say they are on par. I own both. The one advantage to the Audio-Technica are that you don't get sound leakage at night time when the rest of my household is asleep, so make them perfect for watching TV \/ DVD or playing music late at night."}
{"review":"My son purchased Beats from Dre and though the Beats sound a little better, for the price difference these headphones can't be beat. I've had them for about a month now and I take the bass to max w\/o causing distortion, and they still sound crisp."}
{"review":"I bought these about a year ago thinking that they would be a good, cheap pair of over the-ear-headphones. They were the first over-the-ear headphones I've had, but I hate them. I cant wear them for more than 10 minutes without my ears sweating profusely. I need to take them off and air out my ears before I put them on again. I would recommend investing in a better quality headphone."}
{"review":"Cord is way too long if you are not a DJ.  Your ears become extremely hot after wearing these for 30 minutes.  Very good sound.  Very durable.  Impossible to have them in and attempt to role over or sleep with them on as the are bulky."}
{"review":"Spending $30 on a pair of headphones does not give much room to be picky. The fact is, for the cost, I am impressed. Comparing these to some others I have tried for around $100+ I would come back and buy these again at any time.\n\nBass response - 7\/10\nClarity - 7\/10\nDurability - 5\/10\n\nThese sound a bit flat when using in a plug and play scenario, for me I use them on a computer, so I can adjust the output in many ways."}
{"review":"Just recently bought a Roku 3 and wanted a pair of decent headphones to use with the remote. Not a big fan of ear buds.  I own a pair of red ATH m-50's and they are the best of the best but did not want to wear them out watching movies. Since I am totally sold on ALL Audio Technica products decided to look at their lower level head phones. Amazon is running a deal on all ATH models because the ATH \"X series\" has come out. Did not want to spend alot of money so I decided to buy the ATH m-30's. Got them this morning and plugged them into my phone with a fiio amp that I use with m-50's. They are extremely light weight but very good build quality. At first I was not impressed. Thought it was because I am use to the 50's. Seemed to distort at much lower volumes. Then I tried them on my Roku and wore them all day. Extremely comfortable! Great sound on TV and Roku. When I went to bed I put them on and hooked up to my amped phone. It was liked I had my 50's on, (Well almost) No distortion at high volume, crystal clear. Very good bass. I then remembered when I bought my 50's alot of reviews said they had a break in time and get much better with time.  Now I am very impressed. They may not take the extreme power my 50's do, but most people don't crank their music as loud as I do or use an amp. And after all they were 1\/4 the price and they are not M-50's. But I do see myself using these a whole lot and not being afraid to tear them up. Great Head phones!"}
{"review":"The first time that I used this product, there was no sound at all out of the left ear, this was way too expensive to be of such low quality, I will probably never purchase this brand again"}
{"review":"Great headphones, don't get me wrong. Lives up to all the other reviews and hype. But the only flaw I've found is the metal headband parts, are really snug to your head. And if you have an unusually large head\/ears, the earcups aren't deep enough, or soft enough to prevent your ears from being pressed against the drivers. And after 20-30 minutes, the headphones become almost unwearable and you need to take a break.\n\nJust my 2 cents."}
{"review":"I bought these for my wife, who uses them when watching television and they serve that purpose well - however, I would not recommend them for serious audiophiles."}
{"review":"I purchased these for my husband and he absolutely loves them. He claims they are top of the line and he can hear what's being recorded with great clarity. I'm not a techie like he is, but he knows his stuff and tends to be picky about equipment so for him to give these such a high rating, I know they have to be good!  He said they were worth 5 stars plus!"}
{"review":"These phones sounded very neutral which we're great for listening to our studio recordings, but they did not feel very sturdy on the head.  Seemed like the head band was too loose or uneven."}
{"review":"The sound quality on these are amazing!\n\nThe only problem is that I couldn't get them comfortable.\nThe padding didn't prevent pain at all.\nAfter wearing these for 20 minutes it was as if the padding wasn't there at all and my ears were throbbing.\n\nThey also warmed my ears up quite a bit, which could be good in cold climates, but not in the office."}
{"review":"They shipped quickly and without defect. Have been using them multiple times a week for hours at a stretch since the holidays. The sound is good, they are comfortable and adjustable. The cord is very long (sometimes inconveniently long), but I'd rather have it too long than too short. Overall, a good headphone for the price. Would definitely recommend."}
{"review":"I use these at work to help me concentrate while listening to music. I can listen for five or six hours and they don't hurt my ears. The sound quality is very good as well."}
{"review":"got these as I wear hearing aids and cannot wear the small type of head phones.  the sound is great and the fit is comfortable."}
{"review":"My wife was having trouble mixing songs that she was recording through the computer.  She love these headphones.  They're light and sound incredible.  The sound reproduction is as good or better than headphones I have used that cost far more than what these did."}
{"review":"These are a great pair of headphones for the price. I use them for work and am fully able to drown out my coworkers. In addition they are very comfortable on the ears :)"}
{"review":"Really enjoying these headphones.  If you are seeking a product that will be great for listening to music and overall casual use then this will be great for you.  Nothing unnecessary  being sold with these, price point is exactly where it should be.  No complaints, would buy again."}
{"review":"I originally ordered these headphones for recording and editing use for some of my new songs. Upon trying them out I was thrown into a new world. With these headphones you can hear everything the recording was trying to accomplish. Whether its the slight analog hiss or sutble tracks within notes. You can hear everything upon everything. Along with very good bass response. Not to mention they have very good noise cancelling abilities without any external or internal DC power. Extremely satisifed with these headphones and would recommend them to anyone who wants to listen to music at home or do some amateur recording."}
{"review":"I always hated he watches some TV show on his computer in bed at night.\nSo I gave him this on Christmas.\nNow he wears this, so I can sleep in peace :)\nHe says it is really comfortable to wear, so he does not mind."}
{"review":"I'm certainly no professional and had no idea what some of the other reviewer's vocabulary meant. But for me these have been a great option - affordable, decent sound, and comfortable. They don't have a case of any kind - I keep them in a felt shoe bag to tote them around."}
{"review":"These are so popular I really thought they would be better.\n\nMy first issue is that they did not fit my ears properly, the pads are too thin and they squeezed my ears, which caused them to become very uncomfortable after about 45-60mins. I tried adjusting them every which way but It seems I needed to modify the pads.\n\nMy second issue is that the right speaker completely stopped working after about 3 months of very light use. I never put them too loud and never dropped them. They sat on my head or my desk always. Really sucks to have them die out so quickly.\n\nSound quality wise these are OK. They definitely were detailed and quick accurate, but they definitely lacked the sound quality I expected. They also were very anemic in the bass department, it was almost non-existent.\n\nI now use the JVC HARX700 and enjoy them much much more. Very comfortable, better sounding, and cheaper."}
{"review":"I love these earphones.  They are great for listening to mp3s, gaming.  The cost is superb!  I have the ATH-M50's and though not as good, they sound great."}
{"review":"Audio Technica earned there reputation for turntable cartridges, but they certainly know what sound quality is all about. I bought this for use with a Kindle and am very-very satisfied. This delivers Near-Audiophile reproduction (equal to units that cost well in excess of $100) for under $40. I did have to use an adapter because the plug needs to be recessed, but this is a minor issue."}
{"review":"Purchased a Sennheiser HD 202 II headset and the sound was good, the volume was high, but there was lots of noise. It was OK as an every day headset until I purchased the ATH-M30. The M30 is far superior! The MD30 sounds as clear or even better than the Bose QC at just a fraction of the price. Awesome headset! Worth every dollar I spent!\n\nI continue to love the clarity of this headphone. It is far superior!!! I have downgraded the HD 202 II to a 1 star, and it now sits on my bookshelf, rarely used."}
{"review":"Excellent headphones for an excellent price however if you need noise cancelling look elsewhere.  I can still hear the big mouth know-it-all in the next aisle at work."}
{"review":"Although the sound quality was acceptable, These were the most uncomfortable headphones I've ever owned. I would not recommend these to anyone who considers comfort as important as sound."}
{"review":"Bought this for my son.  While the cord is too long, that's easily fixed with a tie wrap.  I bought them as a replacement for some kid headphones that fell apart instantly.  This headphone is much more durable, and has a great sound all for a great price.  Very pleased."}
{"review":"No, they are not audiophile quality, but close. A good set of studio monitors for 40 bucks. I have no complaints. Love the long cord that allows me to sit on my couch while the record spins on the table. Given that I live in an Apartment complex and listen to alot of music late night, my neighbors will be thankful."}
{"review":"I have owned the audio technica m20x for a few years now and they were great headphone only problem I had with those were the volume could have been a lil louder but the sound was superb..owned the audio technica m30s also for a few years and needed a new pair because of years of use and torture..lol..the bass is perfect not to over powering,the highs and mids are sick..these things kick a** in a ipod and iphone,laptop,blackberry,galaxy..when I plug then in to my home system,ahhhhhhh man they put my big speaker to shame. I recommend these to anyone using portable devices,tablets and laptops.very comfortable,blocks out outside noise.for 50 bucks you can't go wrong with these monsters"}
{"review":"I know very little about headphones as I don't use them, but I do purchae them for my teenage son and always read the reviews on Amazon before purchasing.  I bought the ATH-MC30 and tried it.  The ATH-M30 has a beautiful, clear sound and my son agreed with my assessment.  He said they are better than the other headphones I've purchased for him."}
{"review":"I bought these as a gift for my tech crazy son. I was worried that they would disappoint because of the low price. According to my son awesome didn't even begin to describe the quality of sound and performance these headphones offered!!!! Thank you so very much for allowing me to be the \"cool\" Mom at an affordable price!"}
{"review":"Didn't notice that the wire was soooo long. Might look funny listening to music on an airplane! Oh well, works well with my metal detector."}
{"review":"I read such good things about these, and for the money ($40) I gave them a shot. Best headphones I've had. Great, deep bass and clear highs. They come with an insanely long cord, and feature great build quality. One of the best values in over-the-ear headphones."}
{"review":"So much bass wow such music many good times were had. Cord is a little long, whatever though. Cups over my ears very nicely, cancels out the sound of my roommates."}
{"review":"My other headphones are Sennheiser's HD598. When comparing the M30 to the HD598, I am impressed at the performance of the M30 given they are 1\/4th the price. The M30 sounds clear, responsive, accurate and are reasonably comfortable. These are very good headphones for a very good price. I have not used external amplification with them yet, just using source signal from a PC with integrated audio and a Nexus 5. I assume they would respond well to a boost."}
{"review":"My daughter is a musical performance major in college (cello). She needed a high quality set of headphones that provided true sound. I was scared a bit by the low price, but she said these were perfect and really provided pure, true sound."}
{"review":"These are awesome sounding headphones with my equalizer! I am really into gaming and these headphones make everything sound great! Music is awesome and I can hear people much clearer than my old headphones, seen here on Amazon http:\/\/goo.gl\/iZTfei. The reason I am giving these two stars is because I wear these for hours at a time, and after the first 20 minutes they become very uncomfortable. My old headphones were designed to be very comfortable, huge pads around the ears are something I miss. These headphones also squeeze your head pretty tight, and if you have longer hair it becomes itchy and uncomfortable because of how hard they are pressing down. If you want some nice comfortable headphones you can wear for a long time do not get these headphones. The plastic is pretty cheap and they not very durable either. Great sound quality but I will probably be forced to return these because they are too uncomfortable and cannot be worn for more than an hour or two at a time.\n\nSound quality   5\nConstruction   2\nComfort   1\nDurability   4"}
{"review":"If you are a woman with a normal to small head these probably will not fit you. As they did not me. Sadly, it is too late for me to return."}
{"review":"I use these at work when I need to block out phone conversations from nearby cube-dwellers.  Unlike standard headphones I've used in the past, the long cord allows me freely move around without removing them.  Great sound quality and very comfy.  Pleased at the good price as well."}
{"review":"This has turned out to be my best investment for listening to music and enjoying movies on my iPad.  The professional sound quality is better than expected.  The product is constructed very well and fits very comfortable on my head.  Highly recommended."}
{"review":"It has a very long cord which would be perfect for your home listening stereo ,however I use it for exercising so it's a bit cumbersome.  But other wises ok"}
{"review":"I can't say enough good things about these headphones. I saw how great the ratings were and I decided to give them a try. They're affordable and really comfortable. They've got great sound quality and are properly durable! LOVE."}
{"review":"These were suggested to me and since my last pair had just died, I gave them a try.  The sound quality is better and more refined than my previous ones.  ASMR is crisper, clearer and sounds like I am really there.  Soft music, perfect.  Loud metal industrial music, perfect. Soft feeling and light for their size, adjustable to fit.  The cord is amazingly long and the metal near the plug keeps the cord from fraying.as others have done.  Awesome!"}
{"review":"Good Value. Light weight has better than expected sound quality.  Screw off large plug to mini plug is great feature, no need to hunt for adaptors"}
{"review":"I like my new Audio-Technica headphones. There were some reviews saying that it sounded muffled. I do believe I also hear it as I am not an \"audiophile\". After playing around with my sound card settings and the EQ, I found I was able to overcome a lot of the muffleness.\n\nI think they are well made and have a nice comfortable feel to them. There are some reviews say they feel uncomfortable due to the duration of use. I notice if they are not on your head properly, then yes you will get some uncomfortableness. I love how they flex very around my head and not tight at all.\n\nThe cord is made very long (11 feet!) and can be an issue. I rolled over it accidently with my chair a few times so far until I did something different, and if I continued rolling over it, I'm sure I would cause damage to it. But, so for so good and is well made with no signs of damage. If you tend to use it on the go, then you're going to need to figure something out with the long cord.\n\nI love how the gold-plated 3.5 mm connector with screw-on 6.3 mm adapter is made. It also has what is called \"strain relief\" that looks like a spring around the end of the cord. It looks and feels very well made.\nThe only issue I see down the road is the material that looks like imitation leather on the cushions. I had once many years ago the same stuff on some old wireless headphones and it started flaking off and got everywhere. I hope this isn't that same material and is more durable.\n\nOver all I am happy and give it 4 out of 5 stars just because they do sound a tad muffled and fear the imitation leather on the cushions could flak off in the near future. You can't beat the price for these headphones if you're on a budget like I am!"}
{"review":"A magnificent Christmas gift that was for my brother who is developmentally disabled!  Instead of jamming out the house, he can sit peaceably in his room and enjoy the music with these fabulous headphones!"}
{"review":"I own a pair that were bought before leaving for Europe for two weeks.  I wanted something better for the plane ride and for listening to music while away from my Polk Audio RTi12's.  These headphones really are great.  Bass mods and highs very nice with some EQ on your player.  I like the same settings with these M30's as I do with my Sony MDR-10's that I use while working out.  I'm sure there are better headphones out there, but for fourth smackers you can't go wrong with these.  If the long cord is not your taste and you can solder, it is very easy to shorten the cord by adding a 3.5mm plug to the end.  The conductors in the wire are very thin, but still thicker than any I've seen on a headphone and that includes 150 smacker Bose.  Anytime I pass the headphone display at BB, I always wish that I could plug in my M30's for a real A\/B test against the 300 smacker Beats - my guess is that there will very little difference."}
{"review":"Compared to the M50x 'phones I also own, these are underwhelming. Of course, that's to be expected when they are less than a quarter of the price. They sound tinny and washed out, aren't as loud, and the seals on the head aren't as good, so ambient noise blocking is only mediocre.\n\nStill, for basic headphones at this price, they will do the job. I wanted cheap ones for work, so that if they were to get stolen it wouldn't be a big deal. I will say the construction seems sturdy. Just like the M50x, they use metal in the headband instead of plastic, and they have a nice metal coil around the end of the cable that looks like it'll hold up well."}
{"review":"Don't go by my rating I know very little about headphone quality, but if you like good sound and being able to drown out the sound of screaming parents and an on vacuum then you might like these"}
{"review":"1. These are really comfortable. I wear glasses so I'll wear them without my glasses, because they're hurt my head otherwise. Without though, they're great.\n\n2. The sound quality is fabulous! Great bass, mids, highs, just overall wonderful. Really clear too.\n\n3. Noise \"cancellation\" is pretty good. When I have these on and play music, I can't really hear much else, which is great because now I won't hear the TV in the living room. Sound doesn't leak either.\n\n4. Great for the price. Really. If you're looking for headphones but your budget is around 30 or so, or even less, consider spending a little more for these. They'll last a long time and will give you a much better experience."}
{"review":"I utilize different programs and MIDI to produce music. These produce a nice crisp overall tone for perfect mixing in an audio recording or production. I'd recommend these to anyone that isn't wanting to break the bank but wants a great sound."}
{"review":"Bang for your buck with these headphones. The price was right and the sound quality was NOT a disappointment. I plan to order another pair for my spouse."}
{"review":"When I started setting up my home studio for audiobook recordings, this was my first choice. Great scope of sounds, very comfortable, and it even helps block out outside sounds so you can focus on recording.\n\nProfessional quality, for sure."}
{"review":"These headphones were very muffled and they had no type of amp to them. I purchased some Sony headphones from BIG LOTS for 15$ and they were paradise compared to these."}
{"review":"We looked at those $100 plus headphones for our trip to Jamaica but decided to take a chance on these.  So glad we did.  They sound great, if a little quiet when I played movies, are comfortable and the price is right.  The plug's housing was too big to fit into my iPad and iPhone case but an adapter fixed that.  My wife's case, however, didn't pose the same problem.  The cord is long but I'm glad it's not a coiled cord.  I used some velcro strips to manage the extra and it worked out well.  You can't go wrong for the price.  These sounded as good as any of the $100-$300 headphones we listened too at a disposable price.  Maybe if your an audiophile, you won't like these but for the rest of us, these are all you need."}
{"review":"Buyer beware, these are not noise cancelling headphones.  I have had these for two years and they are extremely durable.  I use them at work and have used them for two years straight.  Good quality sound for the money and they are comfortable."}
{"review":"I bought these for my Dad for Christmas. He loves them. He says they are recording quality headphones (coming from someone who was once a radio DJ) and uses them often."}
{"review":"These head phones have audiophile sound and are comfortable.  I like the way they actually block out sound so if you are in a noisy room you do not need to crank up the volume to hear your sound.  This comes with a 1\/8 inch and 1\/4 inch gold plated jack.  Comes with a straight wire (not a coil wire) that is about 9 foot long."}
{"review":"I purchased to replace some in ear headphones and (for the money) they produce good quality music from my I POD. They are not the finest headphones I have heard but then they also don't have the price tag to go along with that lofty status either."}
{"review":"Some may find a need for greater fidelity, but not me.  These are a wonderful set of headphones for everyday home use, though they do begin to feel tight on my head\/ears with too long a session (10-15 minutes x 6in. spread between ear cones) I'm probably a bit sensative. They are very comfortable, until they're not, and then I find the need to take them off for a few minutes, but sound quality is great for most audio off my computer (classical music, rock, movies, video).  If they were just a bit less tight, or adjustable in tension\/clamp down they would have gotten 5 stars."}
{"review":"You get what you pay for. They make your ears hot and sweaty. You can hear outside noise and people nearby can hear what you're listening to."}
{"review":"amazing sound quality for this price! They are really comfortable and a good quality the only down side i find is that the cable is really long- I guess if you want  to use your headphones to watch a movie without disturbing it is a good thing. if you are like me who want to hear great music, meditations and other stuff while working in the house or walking the dog (my favorite) then it is too long... however with some creativity you can make it work. really recommend!"}
{"review":"They just feel really cheap and don't get loud enough. Have to crank the volume up too much and they aren't equipped for noise cancellation. The only feature that redeems them enough for use is that they have a long cable and an adaptable plug\/input."}
{"review":"These are really nice, light weight, great fit, perfectly wonderful sound too plus a good price!\nThis pair of headphones are replacing an older set of Sony headphones that sounded alright - til I heard these! The Sonys let too much \"outside sound\" in, background noises, pet sounds, all the junk that keeps you from really enjoying your music. These Audio Technica headphones keep most of that out, except for very loud sounds - which you may need to hear in case something is wrong! Good music reproduction, good extraneous noise blocking, good fit, plenty of cord, very sturdy all-metal stereo plug AND an extra male adapter for the old style 1\/4\" stereo plugs......What a deal! I have mine - get yours today!"}
{"review":"I have tried a few other head sets, (not really disappointed by them) but none of them compare to these. Fantastic sound. Clear, balanced, and comfortable. If anything happens to these and I need to buy a new pair. I will buy these again."}
{"review":"Some of the best headphones available on the market for their price. Amazing sound clarity. However, my ears began to hurt after long term use (maybe 1-3 hours), so buyer beware. Also took some wearing into out of the box."}
{"review":"I am not a professional musician, just someone who wanted quality headphones because I listen to a lot of music at my computer. I bought these in 2010 right after Christmas, and they still sound great. I honestly can't remember what I paid for them, but it was right around $50 (I think) and they have been worth every penny. If you want quality headphones at a great price, I could not recommend these highly enough. And I'm not someone who has taken especially great care of these -- they are have been dropped numerous times and knocked off my desk by my cat and they still sound excellent. They are extremely durable.\n\nMy only gripe, and it is pretty minor, is that the cord is super long and looks kinda silly around my computer. If I were better at keeping my desk organized, it likely wouldn't be an issue. I wish the cord were just a little bit smaller. But it's such a minor problem compared to how awesome these headphones have been.\n\nFrom what I understand, the M50 is incredible, so I'm tempted to upgrade. However, for those on a budget or those who just want great value, these are absolutely perfect. An outstanding product at an outstanding price."}
{"review":"Bought this headphone for our son so he could play his electric guitar without waking us or the neighbors!  He says the sound quality and tone are excellent. It is comfortable to wear, as it doesn't squeeze and constrict his blood vessels in his head like some other headphones tend to do. It was well worth the money and is a valuable investment for our son."}
{"review":"I took my time in researching various headphones to try to get something pretty high quality for music listening. This particular set of headphones looked good in its technical specs, but it also garnered a lot of support from the Internet and had a very appealing price here on Amazon. I'm no musician and I don't consider myself an audiophile, I just have some interest in listening to music.\nSo trying this out, the ear pads block out some sound, which is a step up from what I had. The headphones fit on snugly and don't seem to be too uncomfortable. As for sound quality, these beat my $20 Logitech headset by boasting more bass while being consistent at all sound frequencies, just as advertised. The only small complaint is that the 11 feet audio cable is a bit overkill.\nFor quality sound at all frequencies, these headphones do it well. The ear pads fit well, the headphones fit well on my head, and the sound is great by boating great bass and mids along with the highs as well. At this price, these work great for music listening by being as natural as possible."}
{"review":"I got for my 8 year old son, who uses it for his IPAD. They fit great, and would also adjust up to an adult size. He really likes this item!"}
{"review":"This pair is nice and has decent sound quality and even \"noise cancelling\" qualities too even if they aren't the high end type. Great for use on the laptop when others are in the room and you need to listen to something.  The connector is solid to and they seem like they will last quite a while.  I would buy these again and recommend them too."}
{"review":"After minimal use over the course of 2 months, the cable produced a short near the plug. The springy metal next to the plug gave me the impression that would never even be an issue. Apparently the purpose of the springy metal is for something else, not to prevent a short.\n\nThese headphones are rated very well on Amazon, maybe I got a dud."}
{"review":"I am far from an audiophile - to me, sound is either \"good\", \"bad\", or \"okay\", and I don't have the experience or knowledge to describe in detail the particulars of a pair of headphones' quality. Keeping in mind that this review is from an average listener, I would say this is a great pair of headphones. The sound is good, the components are very high quality, and they're comfortable. That's really all somebody like me needs to know. I got them for about $50 on Amazon, and as far as I can tell, this is the best deal going for listeners like me - people who want nice headphones, but probably can't tell the difference between these and a $300 pair."}
{"review":"I'm not an audiophile, so to me these sound just fine.  Two minor gripes:  one, my ears hurt a bit after about 30-40 minutes of wear.  In other words, they grip a bit tight.  Two, the cable is thick and really long.  It makes them really only suitable for home use.  Some may see the long cable as a plus.  Otherwise I'm happy."}
{"review":"My husband likes it so I do, too.  Very comfortable and useful when he wants to listen to something that I do not wish to hear."}
{"review":"I use em to drown out coworkers voices...maybe I'm a dick.\n\nBut, those headphone surrounds are comfortable, and great at sealing in music, and blocking background noise!  I've asked people around me, and no one hears my music, even if it's cranked up...go office etiquette.\n\nThey have a really great sound...that rival my Grados.  Plus, they come in at a fraction of the price!\n\nAlso, it has a totally solid strain relief on the headphone jack!"}
{"review":"I'm a music producer and I use these to mix with when it's late and I don't want to make a lot of noise. They are also good for casual listening thru your ipad or ipod"}
{"review":"The headphones are good sound and build quality. The only thing that bugs me is that the cord is length because i use my for entertainment purposes and not for studio. Also, the comfort of the headphones are great for airplane or long car rides. Also, i have stepped on them and worked great still. The sound cancelling could be better but over a good deal!"}
{"review":"These headphones are really good, soft and comfortable for extended listening. The sound quality specially music is unbelievable for the price they are available. It has really strong build quality and doesn't feel cheap at all. I recommend these to anyone who wants to buy good quality inexpensive headphones. Don't think, get it."}
{"review":"Came on time, works great, nice and durable for what I use them for. Not the best sound but you can't compare it to a turtle beach."}
{"review":"They hurt my ears and the cord is really long. Every thing else is ok.the quality was ok.the reviews that people wrote was dead on"}
{"review":"I bought this headphones to record in my home studio. They are so good that i have used them to record drums and many of my friends were amazed by the quality that you get for the price. Im very satisfied with this purchase."}
{"review":"I recently got a second office and decided I didn't want to lug around my old Sennheiser HD-280s, so I thought I'd pick up another set of headphones for the new office.  These had pretty good reviews and run about half the price, so I figured why not.\n\nWhen they first arrived and I took them out of the box, I was disappointed.  They feel light and flimsy compared to my HD-280s, and when I put them on I noticed they didn't completely cover my ears.  Given that I'm trying to use these in an office environment in part to filter out the noise around me, I was skeptical that these would fit my needs.\n\nFortunately, the disappointment was short-lived.  I plugged them into my Nexus 5 and put on some tunes, and I'm very very impressed.  The sound clarity and quality is amazing.  I'm particularly impressed by the deep bass.  My fears about sound filtering were also unfounded -- even at a low-moderate volume level, I can't hear much of what is going on around me, if anything at all.  Unless someone is making a terrible ruckus in close vicinity to you, don't expect to be able to hear anything but the sounds coming out of these headphones.\n\nFor the price you're paying, these things are totally worth it.  If you work in an office, these are a must-have.  And, if you're using those crappy iPod earbuds for anything other than working out, do yourself a favor and upgrade now -- these things are so much better, you won't be able to stand sticking those crappy earbuds in your ear ever again."}
{"review":"Returned because they hurt my ears too much. Extremely painful to wear for over 2 hours and I'm a heavy gamer so I play a lot. I went with the SuperLux 681 evo, not sure how they will do, supposed to arrive tomorrow."}
{"review":"For the price, these are excellent headphones.  (For $100, they're average headphones.  For $300, return them.)\n\nClear, crisp sound, comfortable fit - what more is there to say?  If you're looking for a backup to your spendier headphones, these are ideal.\n\nThese are the closed-can headphones I reach for instead of my open-can Sennheisers when I'm watching movies on the iPad.  Comfort for hours - and they keep the sound in, so I'm not bothering my seatmates.  (My only, only somewhat negative comment to these - and it's far from being a dealbreaker - is that the cord is somewhat comically long.  But if you want to jump rope between songs, you're all set.)"}
{"review":"These headphones are quite good for the price.  They aren't as great as the more expensive, high end headphones, but they are certainly more than adequate for the person who listens to music for pleasure or plays games.\n\nThey fit over my ears comfortably and even if I keep them on for hours, they don't make my ears hurt.  They also block out a lot of the ambient noise in a room.\n\nThe only thing negative I have to say is that they're a bit heavy, but after I have them on for 10 minutes or so, I don't even notice that.  I would definitely suggest them for anyone who wants a cost efficient but sturdy and clear sounding set of headphones!"}
{"review":"These are amazing headphones. This is the first nice pair of headphones I have ever bought myself, despite being a long time hardcore music lover. I felt like every serious music fan should have a nice set of headphones for home listening, so I got these for myself. I am not disappointed in any way. These headphones are amazing. The sound is awesome, the music sounds so good pumping through them. As I read in other reviews, they are not noise cancelling, but when I wear them, I cant hear anything that's going on in the outside world! They are amazing. I have described them to other people saying that I feel like I've never REALLY listened to music before now haha! Great set of headphones. If you are looking for a great set of headphones at an amazing value, definitely pick these up."}
{"review":"Have been wearing these for about six months and I love them.\n\nI'm not an audio expert by any means, but the highs and lows are crisp. There's no buzzing on any pitch, and these isolate noise quite well. The office chatter is reduced significantly while I have these on.\n\nThey're very comfortable and don't hurt my ears, even where I have new piercings. The band fits my large head pretty well too."}
{"review":"Not good in terms of noise-cancel abilities. The spring on the plug stretched too far the first time I plugged them in. I'd think of returning them but they're already damaged."}
{"review":"I've been a  radio disc jockey for close to 25 years and this is one of the best headphones I've ever had. For $30 you can't beat it for everyday use. Going to splurge later and purchase the latest Audio-Technica. M50."}
{"review":"This set of head phones exceeded my expectations. I am a tough customer when it comes to audio equipment and I was very happy when I listened to these. Great bass and high frequency response. I was especially impressed with the strain relief where most wires do tend to fail. The long wire length is a nice plus too. Very happy!"}
{"review":"These headphones are pretty good. I like that the cord only goes to one side of the headphones but I wish they had some way of storing the cord in a retractable device. The cord is very long. The sound quality of these is pretty good. They do a decent job of cancelling outside noise. For $30 you can't expect them to be top of the line."}
{"review":"Can't afford those crazy-expensive Bose or Beats headphones?  These are a great alternative at a low price.  Sound quality is very comparable if you can do without the noise-cancelling quality of those $200 pairs.  These are excellent and a very comfortable fit over my ears."}
{"review":"I bought these headphones for recording purposes and when I plugged them in, I realized that the left speaker is actually the right and the right speaker is actually the left. Also, when the sound panning is in the center, I will only hear out of the right side. When the pan is all the way to the way to the right, I will hear out of the left side. These headphones are garbage!!!! Do not buy!!"}
{"review":"I've had these headphones for about a year now. They sound is great, and the price isn't too high. Everything about them seems high quality."}
{"review":"The good:\nStrong audio quality and delivers a very strong base on par with more expensive headphones however the base is a bit strong. These cans are also reasonably for extended periods of time such as a plane ride. These headphones are also rather comfortable stylish and will fit with most looks.\nThe bad:\naltho these headphones are strong and yo should make sure to put them in the case that comes with them or else they will brake.\nover all\nA strong set of headphones"}
{"review":"These headphones were a gift for our college-aged daughter who has a noisey neighbor and she needed something to block the sound while studying.  Its perfect."}
{"review":"I really did not expect these to sound so good, considering the low price. I record electronic dance music in my home studio and unfortunately, my cat had chewed through the wire of my much more expensive, professional headphones. I'm unemployed right now, so I needed something that would be low price but effective. These were definitely it. I was able to hear things in the music that I was unable to hear before, the bass response is really good and clear. I love the extra long cord, it lets me move around freely while still being able to listen to what I'm doing. I' recommend these for anyone who needs good working headphones, but doesn't have a lot of money to spend."}
{"review":"The left side stopped working after a couple weeks. I've taken good care of these, too. It's very disappointing, especially when it happened to a brand new product."}
{"review":"I bought 3 pairs to have clear communications with my camera operators in a contemporary worship service. I use them with Midland two-way radios with a stereo to mono adapter.  They work great."}
{"review":"Great quality for a low price. The bass frequencies are not distorted and the sound is quite crisp and good. They are great for checking mixes to see how they translate to other systems."}
{"review":"Really like the sound of these. If you only need them for 15 minutes at a time they are best for the $  5 stars for sound! 2 stars for comfort ... ear pieces yeow... after an hour or more"}
{"review":"I bought these based on the many great reviews but ended up returning them almost immediately. The sound quality just wasn't what I was expecting. Everything sounded muffled and muddy, especially the mids and highs I was disappointed and would not recommend these."}
{"review":"I read a lot of glowing reviews about these headphones but after receiving them the audio quality was just not there. I know they are not expensive but I felt the audio was really flat and got worse as the volume was turned up so I returned them. I suppose you get what you pay for. I expected more."}
{"review":"Good quality headphone for a good price.  Although they are not noise canceling, they drown out a lot of outside noise. Rather booth recording, mixing, or engineering, these give high quality sound for a low price."}
{"review":"Well I really trust this company since I had a pair of $90 ear buds I bought and couple months back. Those earbuds wear solid as in metal and the sound was simply amazing. Then when I saw the customer reviews of this headphone I gave it a shot. I was greatly disappointed . The headphones were made of cheap plastic, it tends to slip off when you are movie, the sound is alright I mean it does have bass but its lacking in other ares, and lastly THE WIRE IS SO FREAKING LONG THAT YOU CAN GO HANG YOURSELF . I'm pissed I bought this. Some people on here have low standards when buying headphones. Don't believe the customer reviews on here. What other people think simply doesn't matter. I say just read the specs of the headphones and make a better decision."}
{"review":"Don't think you are getting a pair of headphones that compare to sets that cost hundreds of dollars but do expect to be pleasantly surprised at the quality you get for what you are paying.  I work in a shared office and was rocking my Koss Portapros but wanted to get another cheap pair of headphones I can leave at the office.  These offer pretty decent sound isolation, at least for an office environment.  Sometimes I just wear them without music as a bit of a silent sanctuary.  They perform well when you do want to jam out though.  Probably the best cheap pair of studio monitor headphones out there (I tend to go nuts doing research even when I am buying cheap things).  Buy them.  No regrets."}
{"review":"I like these very much, really good at noise cancellation. The ONLY drawback is the very long cord that attaches to iphone. Will be a hassle. The sound is great!"}
{"review":"Works perfect for my 11 year old daughter. Now she can watch Netflix on her laptop, and I don't have to hear it blasting away."}
{"review":"These headphones were just what I needed: something with better-than-average quality for someone using it for music and entertainment on a PC and tablet, and for using a digital piano. They have a good range, but I'm not well rehearsed on audio terminology to explain more. For $40, if you want to have a better listening experience than using cheap earbuds, go for this."}
{"review":"I've never heard Beats headphones in person, but from what i've heard, they're overhyped.  I would never pay upwards of $200 for a logo on a pair of headphones anyway, mostly because i'm not a hipster idiot.  But these Audio-Technica's are fanstastic, especially for the price.  A lot of bang for your buck.  I do think the bass could be a little better, but they're still easily the best headphones i've ever owned."}
{"review":"There are a lot of headphones on the market these days, and after listening to all the \"top\" name brands, I think I did better by purchasing these studio quality \"cans.\" There is rich bass, and a broad tonal range that I found lacking in the \"B\" brand. Long cord with a reinforced plug, all day comfort, and a good reputation. Highly recommended!"}
{"review":"Didn't expect an amazing set of headphones, but I didn't expect these to be so awful.  Incredibly uncomfortable against my head, the metal sliders that connect the ear pads scratch against your head and are absolutely dreadful.  Originally bought this to upgrade from my iPod earbuds, but these were a huge let down in sound quality, too.  Muffled sound and cracks on occasion.  Would not recommend this product to anyone."}
{"review":"Amazing clarity.  Trebles are crisp, bass are deep and clear...  Best headset ever!  This thing has put new life in my old music.  Highly recommended."}
{"review":"Well heres my review of the Audio Technica ATH-M30 headphones. After owning them for a few days I must say these are perhaps the best headphones I have ever owned so far. Although these are meant for studio use these are perfect for casual listening. The sound quality is superb and for 40 bucks can compete against Beats headphones. The M30s have a well balanced sound stage with powerful bass that doesn't overpower and muddy out the mids and highs. Every part of the audio is very crisp and clear with every song. These headphones pull out sounds in your audio you never noticed before. For example listening to the Star Trek 2009 film sound track, I heard small percussion sounds and effects I had no idea were there listening with other headphones. These headphones really shine in classical, jazz, ska, indie, and other music that involves real instruments and not synthesizers, however the M30s perform well in electronica music like house and some light dub step. (With classical music the sound is perhaps the best everything sounds so amazing and I've gotten lost in the music for hours on end. Every instrument is well brought out and the percussion and lows are quite boomy and wonderful as if you are listening live.) Now since these are studio monitors they are very very comfortable and highly durable although the cans and band are made of strong plastics. You can bend these every which way unlike Beats in fear of breaking the band. Inside the cans are 40mm drivers that have the standard frequency range of  The 3.5mm jack comes with a screw on 1\/4\" adapter. The jack is entirely made of metal and has a stress free spring surrounding the cord leading up to the jack. The cable is quite long at 11 feet as they are for the studio meaning these are not easy portable headphones. I've listened to music with these on for hours at a time before my ears needed air. Which for me is great as these are over ear headphones, where my Beats and others are on ear and I can only wear them for a little more than half hour before my ears and head hurt. On my head the M30s are wonderfully comfortable and don't squeeze my head at all. They are well cushioned on the ear pads and band. I can't wait to hook them up to and amp and lossless music for even better audio quality. Best part is these headphones still aren't fully broken in yet. The Audio Technica ATH-M30 Closed-back Dynamic Stereo Studio Monitor Headphones get a 10\/10 from me! I love them!"}
{"review":"These may have needed thousands of watts & studio panel to appreciate,,, or they're just not that good.. I couldn't tell, so returned em. I couldn't get them comfortable or to sound loud & full, they seemed quiet & subdued, no matter what I played. Whereas a 15.00 pair of wicked 'phones were light, cushy, deep bass & full tone, with an extension cable, gold-plated connections, etc.. i don't see the need for these at all."}
{"review":"I ordered these to replace my Sennheiser HD 202s (which I loved until one of the speakers blew after a year and half - but for $25 who's complaining?), and was hoping for an upgrade in quality after spending twice as much. After listening to music with these for about an hour, I realized I had to send them back. So sad. Here's why:\n\n* Sound volume not great - I had to double my device volume to get the same loudness in these as I did for the Sennheisers. The speakers just aren't as good.\n* Sound quality also not great - Now, I'm no audio pro, but I'm definitely losing a lot of the depth and bass notes from albums which I know for a FACT (based on listens with the Sennheisers!) aren't flat.\n* Poor insulation - When I take the headphones off, there is definite noise leakage. Possibly because I have to pump more volume through them, but I wouldn't want to wear these in public or on a long trip. Can't confirm leakage with them ON, but when they're off they definitely function more like tinny speakers than as actual headphones.\n* Bad fit! I have a small head (5'6\" female and wear small hats), and these barely fit even on the shortest setting with the band on the back of my head. Also, the bottom of the cups on the sides of the headphones hits badly where my jaw attaches, and it's been consistently really uncomfortable.\n\nI do like that there's a single cord rather than the separate cups\/cords on the Sennheisers, but it's not enough to offset what I've lost in quality and comfort. Back they go. Heck, maybe I'll just replace my lovely cheap Sennheisers."}
{"review":"I purchased these for studio tracking headphone monitors.  They are comfortable and have nice flexibility and adjustments.  I have no complaints.  For the price they are hard to beat."}
{"review":"I must start off by saying I'm not an \"audio expert.\" For most my life I've gotten by with ipod ear phones. While I've listened to friend's who have owned both boise and beats, I wasn't willing to pay more than a hundred dollars for a pair. I'm not saying these are better than boise but for the price I think you'd be hard pressed to beat these babies. Great sound and decent noise cancellation. I listen to pretty much anything... country, rock, rap, classical, jazz, etc.. it all sounds amazing. If you're looking for great head phones for under $100 dollars stop your search and buy these now. $40?? Are you kidding me??"}
{"review":"Maybe my model is different but the cord, while nice and thick, is way too long. I have a big coil bunched up near the 3.5mm jack held together by rubberband to take up the slack, otherwise I feel like they would get insanely tangled. This may have something to do with the fact that you have to turn the volume up louder than normal to hear them. Longer cord = more voltage drop.\nThey sound clean and will make you want to switch to lossless audio, mp3 sounds like it has something missing."}
{"review":"I need to have over the ear headphones because I can't stand in-ear headphones, but at the same time, a lot of over-ears are too big and bulky and weird looking or too gangster for my style. These look great. They're subtle and I like the all black, almost gunmetal look. The sound is fine. I'm not a master of being able to tell quality sound when I hear it, so I won't pretend. But I have no complaints whatsoever on that issue.\n\nI just have two problems with them. The first is a smaller problem: they aren't collapsable. This just means they take up a little more space in your backpack, bag, whatever. (they also have a ridiculously long cord, but I don't have a problem with this at all as you can easily tie up some of the slack with the tie the cord comes wrapped in). The second problem has to do with comfort and is more of an issue for me: The foam around the ear pieces is not thick enough, thus my ears get sore after 30-60 mins of use. Other reviews say they fit comfortably on the ears and cause no discomfort, but I cannot lie, that is definitely not the case for me. It's quite uncomfortable if I'm wearing them for more than 2 hours at a time, which I do a lot because I'm a medical student and spend long hours studying. It's possible that my ears stick out more than others although they don't appear to, I'm not sure, but I'm just being honest, they hurt my precious dumbo ears."}
{"review":"Comfortable and great sound. I used to use ear buds but they were too damaging to my hearing. These headphones allow me to set the volume lower and I still get the same range of sound."}
{"review":"Wonderful sound. Beautiful lows, highs and mid-ranges. Very comfortable to wear for hours. I'm not exactly an audiophile, but love listening to music, from rock to jazz and classical - with some country thrown in now and again. These make everything sound great! I would definitely recommend them."}
{"review":"For the money...it's a great product. Very rich in sound. The only problem I have with it is that it doesn't have a volume control to highten the sound that say..an MP3 player's volume runs out of. I know it says it's for the studio, but let's be real...it's mostly for everyday people. Or maybe not...I could be wrong. But, all in all...it's a rich sounding pair of headphones."}
{"review":"I was shopping for a reasonable priced set of headphones.  These were reasonably priced and had excellent reviews. I decided to try them and immediately  knew I had found what I had been looking for.  Great sound and reasonably price."}
{"review":"I was a little disappointed because they sounded a little uneven on one of the ears...I actually thought they were fake at first but they are really comfortable to wear and I guess worth the price but not the wait"}
{"review":"I really hate these headphones but I'm stuck with them until a birthday or other occasion comes along when I can get a better set.  The end connector is loose inside and came that way from the factory. I am very careful with headsets so as not to stretch the wires and these are a GIANT disappointment.\n\nNothing more annoying than listening to music or a movie or even the phone, and hear CRACK CRACK or silence.\n\nIf I manufactured these headphones I would be ashamed."}
{"review":"These head phones are pretty nice for the price. The bass is not the best but overall the sound quality is really god. it would be nice if they had volume controls built in as well. Build quality seems good at this time."}
{"review":"They sound great and for the money I feel like you can't beat these things. However, I didn't give them 5 stars because of three small things:\n1) I hate that little wire the protrudes from the side. The wire just hangs there and looks very vulnerable.\n2) I hate (hate hate) the extra long cord and wish I could roll it up somehow. I used electrical tape to tie it up and what a created is this ball of wires that now weighs down one side of my head. It is def a little annoying.\n3) They don't fold up neatly and I hate (hate x3) that I can't take these headphones everywhere with me because despite 3 above mentioned issues(in order of hate severity from least to most btw), I really love these headphones."}
{"review":"I bought these as one of several for my home studio and they have become my favorite for personal listening because while they're well made, they're light and very comfortable (I don't like tight things on my head). Not as \"perfect\" as higher-end studio headphones like AKGs but totally acceptable for musicians listening to playback while recording."}
{"review":"Very good sound but they hurt my ears if I wear for any extended time. Overall I am very happy with them because I'm not willing to pay a lot more for a really premium set. They meet my need very well"}
{"review":"The ATH-M30s were a great value and sound at the price of $40, but i had one problem with them which eventually led me to return them. They would hurt my ears wearing them for more than 30 minutes, especially if i am wearing my glasses. They would fit over my ears but still cause discomfort after a few minutes, as well as get pretty warm. Its really a hit or miss on these, so I ended up returning them to Amazon. I cannot fully recommend these as a must buy, but for the price it is worth a shot."}
{"review":"These headphones are amazing! For the price you can't beat it. Spectacular quality. I use these headphones for casual movies\/music and I am so happy i bought them."}
{"review":"This was a good set of headphones while they lasted, which was 3 months.  One speaker stopped working, and the return period had expired, so into the trash they went."}
{"review":"It had a difficult time finding a pair of headphones that felt comfortable to me. I'm sure many people would find these headphones quite comfortable, however they just weren't for me comfortwise. The sound quality was excellent however. After I returned these, I purchased a pair of the basic Bose headphones, and found them virtually flawless."}
{"review":"Headphones are light, comfortable, clear, and easily adjustable.  The cord is long and the 1\/4\" adapter screws onto the 1\/8\" jack which is nice.  Just for your information, I'm using with a behringer pmp4000 powered mixer with a phones out 1\/4\" jack (make sure you push the PFL button to send channel to ear phones).  I had my buddy come over and test vocals so I could hear the difference with my earphones as a monitor.  Worked out really well against the bose sound canceling headphones.  However, when playing music through headphones, the bose bass is top notch quality and cannot be beat."}
{"review":"They are so comfy and they fit. The sound quality is so much better than my old head phones. The cord is so long I can now play movies while on my stationary bike. They aren't that expensive either, get them. They are so awesome."}
{"review":"The over ear speakers are a little small for me, and i definitely notice they are on my head, but the sound quality is superb."}
{"review":"I bought it at a discounted price. I like it. I think it's been a year or so since I purchased this and I still use it in the office.\n\nEdit: It has been close to 3 years since I bought this headphone.\n\nAnd I still use it. Let me tell you my honest opinion. This headphone is extremely durable. I am very clumsy and did not take a good care of this headphone while I was using it in the office. I used this headphone at work for at least 6 hours every day for the last 3 years (except on the weekend), and the cables did not break. The ear pads are still intact. The head band did not break.\n\nFor a headphone close to 50 bucks, this is more than you can ask for. The sound quality, mind you, is not the greatest, but it will beat most of the ear-phone or headphone around the same price. I own headphones across a wide range of price. If you want to upgrade the sound quality noticeably from this headphone, then you must spend about 100 dollars more and land in the $150 zone where you can find something like AKG Q701.\n\nIf you just need a durable headphone, this is probably good enough for an average person. The only downside I can think of is the length of the cable. It's a bit too long for an outdoor usage."}
{"review":"My husband was looking for some quality over-the-ear headphones for working in a crowded office, for watching movies while we work together at the kitchen table, and for general music listening. We didn't have super high standards or knowledge of the head phone options before I started researching, but he is thrilled with these. I think they are absolutely worth what we paid and I would recommend them to anyone who needs them for similar everyday use!"}
{"review":"I bought these to use with my amp and bass when I practice at night. They are comfortable, light, and sound perfectly adequate for the intended use. They don't get hot on the ears quickly. They aren't very isolating so it's fairly easy to stay aware of your environment. An excellent value with price-appropriate quality and fit and finish."}
{"review":"I cant wear these for more than 2 hours, they didn't make the cushions big enough causing your ears to press constantly on the plastic inside, making for sore ears. Its been about 2 weeks since i got these, and im just now getting use to it, but the pain of the first two weeks is deffinatly something to note, as its not discomfort, its actual pain."}
{"review":"The sound quality is better than $20 headphones out there but Sony 7506 is much better. This headphone is not very comfortable to wear. My ears start to ache after an hour from physical discomfort even though they seem to be soft. I guess they are just tight. I also feel my ears are stressed from listening and feel like taking a break after an hour. I could use the Sony for 3-4 hours. Given the price, I think they are okay but I am seriously considering returning them and spend up for the Sony."}
{"review":"So these aren't $3K FAD earbuds, but so what?  Do I need to spend that kind of money to listen to music off my computer.  Heck, no.  These are just fine."}
{"review":"I tried these with V-MODA Crossfades.  The sound from these was clearly not as good as the crossfades.  However, I did love the long cord and the padded top headpiece.  However, the ear pieces ended up putting pressure around my jawline, and after about 30 minutes it was really starting to hurt."}
{"review":"What else can I say? They are very Comfortable and do have Very good sound; well balanced. I use these directly out of my laptop (where I use these the most) and a portable radio. I use these mainly while I'm working and I want to minimize the background noise. I like them and for the price I think they are a great value."}
{"review":"I bought these based on the slew of good reviews and also purchased a pair of Audio-Technica ATH ANC3 NoiseCancel Earphones.\nBoth were purchased based on the reviews for this set of headphones. They sounded great and so I imagined that in person I would be decently satisfied.\nNot even close. They sound is distant...dim.. no matter what you put the volume up to and not the greatest quality. These are NOT good for music or gaming, so do not waste your money hoping for that.\nHowever, we have a young son who likes to copy his dad and wear headphones. These are perfect for him, since the volume does not increase to thundering booming ranges. There is no volume control on the headset either, so it relies strictly on the volume of the device it is plugged into.\nGreat buy for kids who you do not trust with volume control and horrible purchase for adults wanting good sound to their music.\nNice cord though with a metal spring at the plug end, unfortunately it is loose and you have to scoot it back down from time to time and please note, at the time of this review the headphones were owned for less than 24 hours."}
{"review":"These headphones, while a little on the large size, produce awesome sound for the price. About the best deal on a set of headphones of this quality in a long time."}
{"review":"I'm a former radio professional and current musician, and I've used many different sets of headphones.  I'm very picky about comfort and sound.  I use these for practicing music at home and playing live in a sound booth, and they are perfect for me.  They fit comfortably enough to wear for long periods of practice or performance, and they are snug enough to block out most outside noise.  The cord is nice and long and the connection to the plug feels very sturdy.  I think these will last a while.\n\nCan't recommend them enough."}
{"review":"These headphones look good, sound good -- but you can not adjust the fit...!\nIt's too small on my average size manly head -- and that makes it uncomfortable\nfor long sessions. I wish i could exchange it for the ATH-40 ---- more money\nbut more comfortable."}
{"review":"These are great comfort and are durable. I've had them for about a year now and they still hold up great and sound quality is still great for the price. Great for blocking out noise too."}
{"review":"Great for playing guitar. Comfortable, very good audio quality, and nice long cord. Also comes with quarter inch adapter. Would definitely recommend to a friend"}
{"review":"Comfort: 9\nSound Quality: 9\nPortability: 7 (Only real complaint is that the auxiliary cord is the length of a jump rope and is not replaceable in the instance where your dog gets a hold of the cord.)\n\nAll in all if you are looking for something with a wide range of sound quality from good rap beats to smooth lead guitars I would easily suggest these as the best deal."}
{"review":"I could wear these for hours with no problems. Very clear and the sounds are crisp! This is a pretty great headset for the price! They are probably the best set I have ever had! Would recommend to friends!"}
{"review":"I wear these for 3-4 hours at a time at work and they are the first headphones that don't make my head or ears sore. Whether I'm listening to classical music, metal, or The Beatles the sound is clear and impressive. Why pay $$$ for Beats when you can get these instead?"}
{"review":"Great headphones for mixing down, and listening to production\n\nif your looking for over amped headphones than this is not for you, but If you want decent crystal clear balanced sound than I cant see why you wouldnt get these"}
{"review":"Not very loud, but great sound. Good bass, clear voice, and very comfortable. It is better for home used just because of the very long cable that is attached to the headphone. For the price, the best headphone I ever had."}
{"review":"The sound quality is excellent. It also reduces most outside noise while the headphones are in place.  Great product. The only drawback is the chord is very long, but it can be bunched together in a rubber band."}
{"review":"Very good earphones for the price.  No complaints, they are comfortable and reproduce sound well - it would be nice to have wireless but maybe later..."}
{"review":"My old headphones died out after a number of years so after reading reviews I selected these. I'm not an audiophile, they do what I need them to do and the price was great. I have not experienced any discomfort wearing them for several hours. If I had to nag about one thing it is that the spring tension is a little to high. I could take off my old ones with one hand, but if I do that with these, the slam together as soon as they are off my head."}
{"review":"These headphones are great. They are comfortable and sound amazing. Also, the price is very attractive. I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a great value."}
{"review":"These are light and just as clear as a bell. The fit the ear the way they are supposed to and have a comfortably long cord. I really do love them for the price."}
{"review":"I have been listening to all sorts of music for the last 50 years. My collection ranges from Bach to Them Crooked Vultures. I cannot find fault in these headphones. The bass is rich and the treble is crystal clear. I especially like the UNCOILED cable that has an adaptable Au plated 2.5mm or 1\/4\" audio plug on the other end. These sound great when plugged into anything, including the whimpy little Mp3 player in my smart phone."}
{"review":"Unfortunately, these do not plug in to my newer generation iPod nano. They work with my laptop though. Just double-check what these headphones can plug into before you buy :)\nAlso, the cord is VERY long. Could be good or bad, depending on what you're going to use these for. I bought these just to listen to at home so the cord does get a little annoying, but it's not a big deal. If you're on of those people who likes to walk around with big headphones on, these probably won't work for you considering how long the cord is.\nThe sound quality is amazing- especially for the price!"}
{"review":"My Sony MDR-V500 finally broke after 8 years.  I wanted to get a reasonably priced and comparable replacement.  After a week of research, I settled on this set.  Excellent sound and fit, and for the price, you can't beat it."}
{"review":"I am very satisfied with this purchase. This is what I was looking for. I do hear some noise, but it's not that noticeable. All in all it's good for what I needed it for."}
{"review":"As I wrote above the sound is good but they are too small for a big man.  My ears don't fit inside the cups.so they get very warm, not unbearable but very uncomfortable when used for more than i\/2 hour."}
{"review":"I can hear on these. That is a minor victory for me.\nMy hearing loss has been hard to fix. These have helped me hear more than I have in decades."}
{"review":"These are good headphones. I use them mainly to practice my electric guitar when I'm traveling ect. They work great on my iPod as well."}
{"review":"The best for the money beats bose and sony. souds like it has powered bass but doesnt it. I just wish i had a little more pricey one."}
{"review":"These are the best headphones you can buy for the price.  I have owned a pair for over 3 years and they are still going strong.  I finally had to replace the ear pads (Auray Deluxe Velour Earpads) but otherwise they are great.  I'm sure there are better headphones on the market but for the price they deliver.  A++++++"}
{"review":"I bought these for work so that I could turn up my music without disturbing my neighbors. They work great, and the sound is really good."}
{"review":"This headphone set works well. I was surprised with the clarity and range of sound.  The cord for the headphones is twelve feet long ideal for monitoring the PFL channel of a mixing board. The cord is also reinforced at the plug to minimize wire breakage. Overall this headphone would compare with some more expensive models"}
{"review":"I bought these as a gift for my husband. He's an audiophile and wanted a pair of over ear headphones. He's had these for over a month now, and he's so happy. He says the sound quality is rich and they're comfortable enough that he falls asleep with them on."}
{"review":"My 12 year old wanted Beats and I wasn't about to spend that kind of money. These have great sound and he is really happy with them. You can't beat the price"}
{"review":"Yes, they sound good.\nI've owned these puppies for about 2 years now and they haven't skipped a beat. After dropping them countless times in snow, water, and cement, they still hold up and look great. The leather on the top doesn't even hint at a sign of wear.\nThis is, quite simply, a fantastic product for a fair price.\n\nBuy it."}
{"review":"Pretty much the only way to go if you would like to havean inexpensive  set of high quality headphones.  I've had mine over a year and typically prefer brands like bose and sony..."}
{"review":"Couldn't imagine better sound.  Snug fit...quiet for people around you.  Cord is a bit long for using with portable devices but my son just rolls up the extra and puts it in his pocket.  I'd have given it 5 stars if the cord was replaceable."}
{"review":"Initially I got these on sale, so the pricing was pretty good for a headset. I chose these because they seemed very large. I have a really big dome, so I tend to need some big earphones to size up it. Overall, the sound is pretty good, not as great as some other bigger named headset, however for the price I got them at, they're great. 4 stars from me only because since I have large ears and a large head, they kind of pin my ears and make them sore a bit. So other people with big domes, be cautious!"}
{"review":"You can't beat the sound  and affordability. My wife and I love them. The base is not \"muddy\" the high end is crisp and clear. What's not to like? She uses the head set while at the PC, watching a movie, listening to music and I can use the second pair to plug into my guitar amp without scaring the neighbors. If I were making professional recordings, I would probably have a pro headset, which would cost accordingly. This set sounds very good, it is well made, comfortable and affordable.  It comes with an eleven foot cord with 1\/8\" jack and a screw on 1\/4\" adaptor, both gold plated. A very nice pouch\/bag is included."}
{"review":"If you're looking for pretty good sound at a solid price, these are it. I got mine \"open box\" through Amazon warehouse, but the package was sealed and they were obviously brand new.. I guess they were returned? Regardless, it was about 25% off the Amazon price.\n\nThese are excellent headphones for death metal (or any metal\/rock genre). The bass is not overpowering, but is substantial, especially after they are played for a while. The mids are a little lacking in some songs, but others they are great.. I can't attribute it to the headphones, I would most likely guess it was the audio file itself. I use these for my computer, and I also game a lot with them. They are excellent for any game out there and provide great left\/right directional audio. However, if you are a big listener of heavy bass (rap, hip hop, r&b, dubstep, etc.), I can't recommend these.. They were lacking on the very low end, it's almost like they couldn't handle repeated, long bass notes. But, like I said, they are excellent for any other type of music, including metal, rock, country, etc.. just not so much with prolonged, extremely deep bass notes.\n\nThe build quality is excellent for the price range, they are very comfortable to wear, and they block out noise from inside and out as well as any other headphone that aren't noise-cancelling (the closed back design helps with this I think?). The cord is more than sufficient in length, but I'm not sure if the spring actually will help with and cord\/plug separation.. only time will tell in that regard. Overall, excellent headphones for the price, definitely 5 stars.. some people need to realize these aren't Audeze LCD3's."}
{"review":"These headphones work quite well, very comfortable, and came at a very good price.\n\nI use these with the iPad to watch streaming videos and youtube presentations.\n\nI would buy these again."}
{"review":"I have been nothing but satisfied with this purchase. The sound quality is superb. It is crisp and clear on high and low notes, and the bass is substantial but not overpowering. As someone who has never owned high-quality headphones before, I was amazed at hearing new instruments and subtle beats in songs that I had never noticed before. The pads are very comfortable, and the overall fit is great.\n\nThey are not true noise canceling headphones, but they isolate sound well enough that outside noises won't overpower any music, and people nearby won't be disturbed by sound leakage.\n\nIt should be noted that these have a very long cord, which could be a pain if you plan on carrying them around much, but for primarily home\/studio use, they work very well.\n\nFor the price of $50, the ATH-M30s are a fantastic deal. I would recommend them to anyone, audiophile or not, looking for quality headphones at a good price."}
{"review":"I got these for my 78 Year old father who likes to rock out to Eric Clapton. lol\nI tested them out and they sound great. The cord is very very long. Not good for going mobile but great for living room use.\nGood price Fast shipping."}
{"review":"We payed a LOT for a pair of bose headphones that didn't sound as good these do. When they say professional grade, they were telling the truth."}
{"review":"The sound is great. Both high and low frequencies are very crisp and clear. They are built very well and made to last, the only thing that could make them better is if the power cord was able to detach from the headphones. Very comfortable to wear for long periods of time."}
{"review":"My Bose headset only last 4 years and fell apart.  I found this unit as a replacement which seemed to have provided a lot of great recommendations.  I bought it, it arrived nicely packaged and on time.  I am impressed with the quality of the design and the strength of the materials used in its construction.  It should last a long time.  The single cord coming from the left earphone is a big improvement from the previous headphones.  Sound is excellent.  The reinforced plug is a real asset, as well as the eleven foot cord.  This is a very nice unit, and I am well pleased.  I would buy another if I needed a second set of earphones."}
{"review":"This product is good for listening in quiet places. It is completely the wrong product for listening on an airplane as it does not protect you from the noise of the airplane and cabin."}
{"review":"I think sounds great and really comfortable for the price I got it for (under $50). The only con is the headphone plug will not fit the phone if it has a case over it (deal breaker for sum, but not me)."}
{"review":"I read a lot of reviews before I bought these. Originally I intended to spend $20, but decided to get these to lessen my chance of disappointment. And I am glad that I spent the extra money!\nThese seemed more geared towards professional mixers, but they work great for me. I listen to music and watch movies on my computer, without disturbing my wife. The added benefit is that I hear sounds that I have never heard before. My wife can not hear these at all while I am listening, and I hear very few outside noises.\nThe other reason that I got these was comfort. I had a cheaper pair, but they hurt my head and ears after a very short session. I have already worn these for over 2 hours with no discomfort at all. And the cord is long enough that I can push back from my desk and recline.\nI would highly recommend these!"}
{"review":"I don't know if the three star rating is fair as I could not wear these headphones for more than a few minutes because they were so tight they gave me a headache.  The ear pads were small (maybe I have big ears?!), which was uncomfortable.  The top and bottom of my ear were pressed by the pads.  But the worst thing was the feeling that my head was in a vice.  The spring steel (?) inside the head band was for me extremely tight, compressing the head phones, the ear pads, tightly against my head.\n\nWhen I had the headphones on, I thought the sound quality was very good."}
{"review":"i would buy these over beats by dre any day, the sound quality is so much better and they are really comfortable to wear all day use"}
{"review":"I used to by high end Sony Headphones, I saw these on sale and decided to give them a try. After 6 months the earpieces show absolutely no wear and tear after lots of use. No sign of slipping off, cracking, or any of the usual things I would see with the Sony pair by now.\n\nIf you need a good pair with high longevity, I would recommend these in a heartbeat."}
{"review":"I love these headphones.  I work in an open office space and I was looking for a good headphone to get me less distracted.  I read the reviews for this headphone and wanted to give it a try.  It is not a noise cancellation headphone but with some music on , it serves the purpose. These headphones feel very comfortable and I am pleased with my purchase."}
{"review":"I though that this product had an in-line volume control, it does not. My fault for not researching more thoroughly.\n\nThey are comfortable, I wear them almost the entire work day.\n\nThe jack, which *appears*  to be strong is already showing signs of trouble. I have to wiggle it to get the full audio content. That's disappointing considering they are less than a year old."}
{"review":"I bought these because they were on every \"best headphones under $50\" list. I got them and the sound quality was very poor. I returned them as fast as I got them. DO NOT BUY THESE. They are trash."}
{"review":"These headphones are great.  Good sound in my cubicle.  When music is playing I can't hear the noisy conversations taking place in other cubes around me.  They do NOT have sound canceling abilities but they are GREAT at isolating out the office noise around me."}
{"review":"I found these to be a great buy and great for the money on behalf of my friend. They are comfortable and you can just get lost in the sound in these. The sound is clear and so quality sounding. It just sounds great. You can hardly hear anything else when you put it on."}
{"review":"The ATH-M30s are great. The audio is very clear and the headphones seem very durable. Another great feature is that length of the cord is about 8-10 ft so there shouldn't be any issues with restricted movement. The only issue I have with them is that wearing them for an extended period of time(2-3 hours) causes my ears to become sore. Other than that minor issue, they headphones are great."}
{"review":"These headphones are great, sound coming from it is crisp, and no static. I only have one gripe the cord is a bit long. I would have everyone buy this."}
{"review":"Comfortable fit and nice, quality components. The cable is the only concern, I carry around a hoodie front pocket full of cable when I use them."}
{"review":"These completely fit my needs as a budget friendly, good sounding pair if headphones for use with listening and recording my music creations.  They sound great and completely cover my ears. Really, what else do you need?"}
{"review":"comfortable, lightweight, much better sound quality than my iphone earbuds. these don't fold up, but i am only using at home. the folding set cost much more but the sound quality is identical"}
{"review":"I have been using the ATH-M30 headphones for about 2 years now. They are very comfortable to wear and I like how they completely cover your ears to keep other sounds out. I wear them a lot for watching YouTube videos. My daughter likes them so much that she keeps borrowing mine, so I broke down and bought a second pair. They don't have a volume control but that's not a big deal and I like the long cord.\nAlso have great quality of stereo sound for music, tv, etc.\nI would recommend these to others, as I am very happy with my purchase!"}
{"review":"Not being a huge audiophile of sound junkie, I couldn't care about the difference between sound or quality in my headphones. Yet these have change my perspective. These things are incredibly comfortable that I have fallen asleep with them on many times. The sound quality can range based on volume and genre. Each time I heard some hip hop the headphones were on medium volume in order to hear the bass, and on rock and alternative the volume is on high in order to hear all the guitars, drums, and any other instruments. The speakers close your entire ear so there is very little noise cancellation as well as no noise leaking from the headphones. For the price, these things were a great surprise.  I always try to recommend these to my friends and can't wait to save up and upgrade to the ATH-M50"}
{"review":"I wanted a noise cancelling headset that fit comfortably over my ears, so I bought this one. It's fantastic! It works with all my audio devices. A great purchase!"}
{"review":"I purchased these for my mother for Christmas, but I was able to test them out shortly after she opened her presents. Other \/far\/ more experienced audiophiles (I typically grab the closest set of earphones; I'm really not picky whatsoever) have remarked that these are better suited for recording and music production--which is obvious, as it's in the name \"studio monitor\"--but from what I've observed (tested them out on a DVD player), they're very good headphones for just about anything so long as you're not too particular. Exceptionally clear and bright sound, comfortable padding for short-term listening, and--overall--sturdy construction as typical of Audio-Technica.\n\nAgain, I'm not an audiophile, and there's a new version of these headphones coming out next month (!)--but as they are, the ATH-M30 is a steal."}
{"review":"I got these on sale for around thirty dollars and they are well worth the price.  Long, sturdy cord and jack, comfortable fit and excellent sound.  I think the normal retail price is close to eighty dollars, and I would not have paid that, but for the rebated price a very good product."}
{"review":"As a life long musician and home recordist, and a lifelong user of Sony MDR7506 and Sony MDR-V6 headphones, my purchase of these headphones raised for me the age old question, \"what's the best pair of studio headphones for under $100?\" Please notice that I said \"studio\" headphones, because in my view, the purpose of studio headphones is slightly different from consumer headphones. In the studio you want two things: 1) A good, reliable way to evaluate your sound recording, and 2) A good reference for how your music will sound on other people's equipment down the line--bearing in mind that they'll be listening with everything from $5 earbuds to $500 speakers. Given those criteria here's what I would say about the ATH-M30 Headphones:\n\nThe music you produce in your home studio will consistently sound richer and more beautiful on the Sony headphones, as compared to the ATH-M30's. On the Sony's, the bass is richer and the highs are sweeter. However, from the home recordist's point of view, the sound quality of the Sony's is so good as to be a bit misleading. That is, your product will sound better on the Sony's than it will on 98% of other systems. By contrast, the ATH-M30's are an excellent reference point for how your product will sound to the rest of the world. Don't misunderstand, I'm not knocking these headphones. To the contrary  they are an excellent pair of $40 headphones, just as the Sony's I mentioned are excellent $85 headphones. But the ATH's will give you a better window on how your music will sound to your potential audience.\n\nAn analogy to what I'm talking about it is the Motown experience in the 1960's: The Motown producers used the best studio musicians they could find, and the best equipment they could find. But ultimately their songs had to pass one stringent test: How would the music sound coming out of a transistor radio? That was the final test! If it didn't sound right coming out of a transistor radio, it had to be re-mixed. The equivalent today would be does it sound ok through a pair of throwaway earbuds?\n\nSo if you're looking for the most beautiful sound that you can find for under $100, get the Sony's. You won't be disappointed. If you want a good, inexpensive set of reference headphones for your home recording studio, think about getting the Audio-Technica's. And if you want to play it safe, do as I did and get them both."}
{"review":"The music sounds great with this headphones, they are comfortable to use and have a reasonable price.\n\nThe only issue I see with them is that they seem to be made for a studio recording rather than a home user. The cable is quite long and therefore it is a bit uncomfortable to use at home."}
{"review":"the headphones were reasonably priced, the sound is good, and they're comfortable to wear. I use them to watch movies when my son is sleeping and I'm not able to turn up the surround system."}
{"review":"I am very pleased with this purchase. I use it with my Kindle Fire with music, Pandora, and audio books. Each venue works great, providing an enjoyable listening experience. Great product and sound for a very reasonable price."}
{"review":"I was attracted to this particular headset because of the mass of positive reviews, and the great price. Now that I've had mine for some time I must say that they're quite comfortable, and the clarity is top-notch. While I'm sure I will eventually go for one of a higher quality in the future for right now the ATH-M30's are more than a bargain."}
{"review":"But still big for my head.  And they are heavy feeling.  I do like them since they don't squeeze my ears but not as comfortable as the gaming headphones my son has."}
{"review":"I'd tried on the ATH-M20 in the past, and the price-to-quality ratio was great. I assumed the same would be true of these (it is!). For the price, I don't think the M30 could sound much better. They're comfortable, and unlike the M20 I tried, the M30 speakers didn't need to be broken in (M20s had no bass at first). Though they're not active noise-cancelling headphones, these block out a lot of background noise.\n\nDurability:\nI can't say if they'll stand the test of time. They seem reasonably sturdy, but not bullet proof. I don't want to know what will happen the first time I accidentally sit on them. If the price tag wasn't so reasonable, I'd take off a star for toughness."}
{"review":"I bought this as a Christmas gift to a very dear friend and he was very happy about it. He never leaves without it. :)"}
{"review":"These are high-end headphones that I got for my wife, and she really loves them.  They truly are noise-cancelling and she loves to use them to watch movies."}
{"review":"Excellent sound if you compare that the price was really low. The audio jack is for pro users, which makes it a really good purchase."}
{"review":"Originally ordered the Skullcrushers for the same price, and boy did they live up to the name! Most uncomfortable headphones I've ever had. These on the other hand are fantastic and incredibly comfortable. I could wear them for hours."}
{"review":"I like these headphones, yes the cord is a bit long but it comes in handy if you need to move around. I definitely wouldn't want it to be too short. The sound quality is good. I would prefer more bass. As far as noise canceling they are moderately good. Overall, considering the price, they are worth a try."}
{"review":"I bought these headphones a while back and took my chance with them thinking they would be mediocre for the price I am paying. These are great! I am so happy with them because they have great sound quality and you can't hear any background noise when listening to your favorite music. As well, you can turn the volume up as much as you want and people around you won't hear a thing."}
{"review":"This was on my sons christmas list and the price was right. great sound from a very affordable headphone. I would recommend this to a friend."}
{"review":"I purchased this for drowning out the noise on an airplane, for which they do a great job. They sound great and make the in-flight movies sound fantastic. My only small gripe is that after extended listening their weight starts to make wearing them slightly tiresome."}
{"review":"Crystal clear, good quality sound and an extra long cord. Perfect for attaching to the computer or an audio device and be able to move around with ease."}
{"review":"The ATH-M30 have a very clear sound, the only thing I can say about these headphones other then sounding great, is my ears will begin to hurt after wearing them for more than 3 or 4 hours, other than that I am happy with my purchase."}
{"review":"This is a great headphones considering the pricepoint.\n\nIt provides a considerably good noise isolation and depth. This coming from someone that isn't an audiophile."}
{"review":"Solid quality construction, design and build with good audio performance and comfort at a bargain price. Nice bass and well controlled mid-range and clear highs. Only issue is can't be folded."}
{"review":"I didn't buy it for studio use, just to listen to music.  The cord is nice and long, the ear pieces are big enough to be comfortable, and it sounds clear."}
{"review":"Got these with a great discount from Amazon during the recent Christmas holiday. The mid-range and highs sound crisp and clear, without being overly bright or sharp.  The lows are reproduced through out the entire range, without being one note thumpy or muddy.\nThere is no hiss or unwanted audible noise. Outside noise is well blocked out and does not intrude.\nListening to them and comparing them with the my headphones is quite a shock. One sounds like I am tucked away in a closet and these ATH-M30 sound like I am front row center at the concert.\nI generally listen to oldies rock and roll, newer  KPop, JPop, CPop. I would recommend these with no hesitation or reservation."}
{"review":"These are some of the nicer headphones I've owned.  I must admit, I'm cheap: I spent a long time buying lousy earbuds, which wore out in a month or so.  FINALLY I broke down and got a nicer pair, and they have served me well!  I use them several times a day, and I've fallen asleep in them.  I have not, admittedly, been kind to them.  I've been using (and abusing) them very steadily for the last nine months, and just today I have gotten a small amount distortion (sounds were somewhat robotic?) which could be corrected by fiddling with the cord.\n\nIf you are kinder to them than I am, they will likely last you a good deal longer.  I fear I may have killed mine, but yours does not have to suffer the same fate!\n\nThroughout their time with me, they have provided nothing but the finest sound, and have a cord long enough for some dancing around near the computer.  Comfy and somewhat noise-blocking, I am very pleased to have owned these, and once they do finally go, I certainly intend to buy another pair.\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to mention, regarding that distortion?  That wasn't the headphones, that was the early sounds of my computer dying. As it turns out, the headphones were just fine, and continued to serve me well until just a month ago (nearly two years after my original purchase) the plug broke.  I was convinced by a friend to pick up Skullcandy ones as a replacement, and nice as those are... I miss these terribly. Super comfy, great sound, and excellent lifespan."}
{"review":"I like a lot about these headphones, especially the cord length which is perfect for watching T.V. in the rec room which is underneath our master bedroom. So, I get to hear all the dialog of the program and my wife gets to sleep soundly without being disturbed. The stereo quality is very good, especially for the price, so it's a great value."}
{"review":"These are amazing! I really like the sound. They fit nicely on your head for a long period of time. The cable is very long! Which is great when you have it connected to your desktop and you're laying on your bed. But kinda annoying when you're laying on your bed with an iPod or something. Overall, I couldn't be more pleased with this product and the price!"}
{"review":"I use these for playing in a band and they are excellent.  These days, \"noise cancelling\" seems to just mean the headphones go around your ears, and these do.  They are comfortable, easily adjustable and sound great."}
{"review":"For the price, pretty much perfect.  The bass is somewhat lacking but otherwise perfectly balances and the design makes it comfortable to wear for hours. Also most intelligent clamshell packaging ftw?  YES"}
{"review":"After purchasing three wireless headsets in the past fourteen days, along with returning one, see my previous reviews, I finally came back full circle and purchased the Audio-Technical ATH-M30 Professional Studio Monitor Closed back Dynamic Stereo Headphones. Why yes it's not wireless and why yes it's doesn't have built in adjustable volume at the headset but you can buy a Koss V20 Volume Control Extender to adjust volume for under $10. We're talking about a very comfortable professional headphone for under $40. Read the other reviews which discuss excellent sound and quality. You can't go wrong with this choice for that price. Nope not likely!\n\nTuesday January 20th ... The Koss V20 Volume Control Extender turned out to be only a meter long (39.37 inches) and the volume adjustment really didn't increase the volume. Therefore, don't buy this device as a solution here, if you're looking for either a longer cord or something that will adjust the volume. I sure there are solutions that will address these issues but this proposed solution wasn't it."}
{"review":"Great sound and comfortable fit. However, extended use can be tiresome. Around the ear design prevents air flow and causes some sweating. Continual use of ears can cause attention to wander. About one hour use at a time is about my limit."}
{"review":"Use these often in the recording studio and they provide a nice flat response and handle a good amount of volume.  Excellent choice for some basic headphones...not too bright..."}
{"review":"Bought these for my teenage daughter actually have metal framing verses the plastic crap that more expensive was so impressed with the sound quality plan on buying another for me"}
{"review":"I bought these as a Christmas gift for my husband. We all received a different version of headphone for Christmas. These by far are the most comfortable and have the best sound quality. These are professional studio headphones."}
{"review":"I like these headphones a lot. The sound quality is great. I chose 4 stars because they are obviously not the best headphones. One problem is the cord. It is around 5,000 yards long(exaggeration). That is basically the only problem. They are pretty comfortable to wear for a while. Overall, pretty good headphones."}
{"review":"I am happy with this pair of headphones, the sound is very clear and crispy, for the price I pay didn't expect , so great sound."}
{"review":"These phones sound great. However, they are really light and don't feel extremely well made.  When you hold them in your hand you feel like you need to take extra care of them as to not break them.  Great sound, just a little flimsy. AND the cord is obnoxiously long for the average user."}
{"review":"I'm not a sound pro, but the sound quality of these headphones are the best I've ever experienced. I like them better than a pair of Bose headphones I used to own. They're not noise cancelling, but they do muffle outside sounds. When I watch a movie with these on I feel like I'm at the theater. Very nice and a great price."}
{"review":"I'm not sure how you could get more out of a $40 headset.  Crystal clear and good noise cancellation.  I wear them on the metro and walking around.  Metal components, sturdy, and high quality for a non-professional headset.\n\nMy only complaint is that I have an old and tiny mp3 player so it doesn't have enough juice to turn the volume up very loud, but that is hardly the fault of the headphones."}
{"review":"These headphones were an awesome buy. The quality of sound is really crisp and they're very comfortable. I use it for online gaming, listening to music, and I use the jack adapter to plug into my amp for my electric guitar. I would recommend these headphones to anyone looking for quality sound at a great price."}
{"review":"I was looking to replace my old AKG 220 series cans, & since they no longer make them, started looking at other affordable set's when these caught my eye. My AKG's were my go to cans for tracking in the studio, & my grab & go pair for field work recording concerts & clinics. These AT's do a good job. For the most part, I just need to confirm that I'm getting a clean signal on whatever rig I'm recording with...no hum, or other noise maybe caused by a bad cable. For tracking, I prefer these for recording distorted guitar & bass. For vocals & acoustic guitar, I like the Shure 440's better. They're hotter to wear than the old AKG's, but don't squeeze your melon as hard as the Shure's. Bottom line, these are a good deal since they dropped the price to the $40 range from the $60 range. Great for everyday use, & good enough for tracking in a pro studio."}
{"review":"The main reason I bought these headphones was to plug them into my stereo system and listen to records. The sound quality is awesome. Really good a noise canceling if you are listening to them loud enough. Overall, I am super happy with this purchase."}
{"review":"The monitors were just what my grandson had ask for and he was very pleased with the quality. The package arrived on time and I was very satisfied with this product."}
{"review":"These are great for someone looking for great sound but don't need professional quality headphones, they're just listening to mp3s and gaming. The downside is though I found these searching for over-ear headphones, not on-ear, these are definitely not completely over-ear. They sit on part of my ears at least, making them uncomfortable for extended-wear. I didn't think I had exceptionally large ears, nor do they stick out too much."}
{"review":"I use headphone for several hours a day and many pair that I have purchased are uncomfortable over time and much more expensive. Also, headphones like those from Turtle Bay are flimsy and use poor materials. These seem to constructed much more solidly. Got these a couple of days ago and have been impressed with four things.\n1. Comfort\n2. construction and durability\n3. sound\n4. price\nCan't beat 'em for the money."}
{"review":"I've had these just over two years now, and have used them at work daily.  Every day, I will plugin\/unplug these in to my phone several times a day.  The audio jack is solid, and has a metal spring to protect the wire.  These are comfortable enough to wear 8+ hours a day without being a burden.  I love music, and these have great sound quality.\n\nI'm happy I bought these, and would consider buying them in the future if I ever actually needed to."}
{"review":"I'm not much of an audiophile and I got these headphones mainly because I wanted a pair of over-the-ears and it has an excellent 11 foot cord that lets me sit far away and still be connected to my desktop.\n-Solid build quality and very comfortable\n- Decent volume and clear sound"}
{"review":"Just opened up my new headphones, and blasting some \"Who\" songs as a test. I did considerable research on this site, and am very happy I upped my budget to purchase these Audio-Technica headphones. The stereo separation is terrific; some of the detail sounds I have never heard before from other headphones. I can play these as loud as I care to. I prefer the over the ear style - it certainly cuts out outside sounds and noise (although they are not advertised as sound canceling). I am very happy, and I believe you will be too."}
{"review":"I really love the headphones! They are great and good for the price! I am putting four stars because i don't know if it will last for the whole year because its  1 year warranty. Also, they are not collapsible and i don't  where to put them at.  Other than that you should definitely get this product!"}
{"review":"For $40, I haven't been able to find anything close to this value. They provide good quality sound, not as great as Beats\/any of those higher-tier headphones but the sounds loud and clear. Doesn't fold up, and its awkward if you wear them around your neck or something (i just turn the towards each other). Cable is really long, just tie it up, and they have a nice wire at the bottom so it won't break as easily. Overall, not as comfy\/good quality as those $300+ headphones, but then you're only paying a fraction of the price."}
{"review":"Be warned, the material covering the headphones themselves will start PEELING after awhile. Also, they're great if you like clarity. Not so great if you're someone who likes a booming bass."}
{"review":"This is my second pair of these in 3 years (first pair got stepped on by a careless bandmate) These are good headphones for the price. The sound is accurate and the headphones are very comfortable. It rivals my $100 pair of Sony's."}
{"review":"These are good for the price. They do have a small amount of buzz feed back that come through when plunge into my guitar amplifier."}
{"review":"I recently purchased these headphones and I must say, the quality of the sound is very clear. It is also very comfortable, even if you wear glasses. This type of quality I've witnessed is impressive clarity, from highs to lows, even the bass is appreciated. If you're a listener or a producer, definitely check these out."}
{"review":"I can't get these to plug into my mac book air outlet without an incredible amount of force--enough to where you wonder if you're going to break the inlet on the macbook.  And sometimes it won't plug in at all, so I'm going to return them.\n\nThe good news is that the sound quality is good--i can't tell a difference b\/t the sound on these and my $120 pioneers."}
{"review":"Head phones work great. I needed to get a 10 foot extension cord for them to reach  my chair in the living room. My wife works nights and sleeps days, so I need to be as quiet as possible during the day. I love the straight cord over the coiled cord on my old headphones. As long as you don't want to record something the headphones also work great with my computer. Guess I will go watch a movie on Amazon Prime to give them a good test.\nSHIPPING: Not sure what happen with shipping! I ordered them on 1\/9\/14 and they arrived 1\/14\/14. I am an Amazon Prime member and they were suppose to be two day shipping. UPS handed the package off to the USPS so it took even longer. The package sat in the UPS receiving center about 2 miles from my house for two days. Who ever shipped them must have pushed the wrong button I guess."}
{"review":"I wanted a set of \"work\" headphones that would be comfortable to wear for long periods. Not cost me an arm and a leg. And get somewhat decent sound without completely drowning out my coworkers. That last part seems strange, but I actually like to be somewhat attentive to my coworkers if they need me. So far this set of headphones has been a worthwhile purchase. I'm very happy with the sound and fit. And, I may just consider upgrading to the ATH-M50s for home use."}
{"review":"These cancel noise even though they're not advertised to. I can ignore anyone if I crank these up to their loudest which is mind blowing or enjoy the quiet with just the headphones on. Dubstep and any music really is beautiful when they come through these. Get these, they're for anyone and everyone, They will make your old apple headphones a thing of the past."}
{"review":"I purchased these for my son, who is a music fanatic.  He was replacing another set of another brand that just lost one side.  he is very happy with them.  arrive promptly, in great packaging and he is now back to his music...without disturbing us and loving it.\n\nAudio-Technica produces great sound, with noise blocking so he is able to keep the volume lower and hear more."}
{"review":"I'm one to just buy the $20 headphones I've always used.  Sony usually.  But I have to admit, these things are different.  I found myself going through my music collection to hear what the songs really sound like.  Nice crisp, clean sound.  Not simply loud and basey to make an impression.  And the price isn't that different from what I'm now thinking of as 2nd rate headphones.  Very happy."}
{"review":"Good to use at night so you don't disturb others. Cord is long but I still wish it was longer. Decent sound and the price isn't bad."}
{"review":"I found these on Amazon and decided to listen to the reviews... at least most of them.  These are warm sounding headphones with a nice bass fullness.  These don't have the scratchy highs (e.g., tsst, tsst, tsst) sound that some headphones have which I personally don't care for.  My only gripe is that the jack is a little large and won't insert completely in my Iphone unless I remove my protective case...which is a hassle.  Other than that, these headphone are pretty damn good for the price."}
{"review":"I have training as an audio engineer and producer, but I'm far from a professional. I needed some cheap headphones to record some music on my computer as a hobby.\n\nNo, they won't block the sound of a jet engine taking off in front of your face. No, they won't survive a shotgun trigger. No, they're probably not the most cross-spectrum, flat-frequencied, hyper-accurate, scientifically-developed specimens out there, but if you're looking for $40 headphones, you're not looking for that anyway.\n\nWhat they will do is sound fantastic. They're clean and clear and do an extremely capable job of blocking out all 'normal' external sounds. They have a very long cord which is handy if you're doing any recording and a minor nuisance at best if you're just listening to music casually. It's a natural 1\/8\" plug for use in a computer or an iPod, and there's also a screw-on 1\/4\" adapter if you need to use this with most recording hardware. The plug also seems to have a sturdy metal housing and a spring to help keep everything together if the cord is bending and moving around, which it will."}
{"review":"They have good reproduction of sound.  The 1\/4 \" RCA plug adapter screws on instead of plugs in to the 1\/8th \" plug, eliminating the distortion that comes with movement of cheaper phones and adapters."}
{"review":"Excellent product works well. It's exactly what I needed for recording and just listening to music. This product fits perfectly and comfortable and soft around the head and ears ."}
{"review":"Very comfortable, sound great, 11' cord gives freedom of movement, great value for the money.  Very happy with my purchase. The only thing I can think of which you may want to consider is that these aren't small headphones.  As with any large studio monitor headset, some women may find them too bulky; just like my girlfriend did. Other than that one detail, these are great and you will be happy with them."}
{"review":"Received the package 3 days before the expected date.\n\nThe headphones are very comfortable and sound is very clear. They actually justify their name. The headphones are studio quality headphone with very clean and clear sound and good bass. You can hear even the small sounds while listening to any song or watching a movie very clearly.\n\nAwesome product for the price and best in its class. The pricey beats can't match them!"}
{"review":"I only had them on 15 minutes before my right ear--the sticky-out one--was hurting. Fortunately I had a sheet of 1\/4\" stiff plastic packing foam that I'd peeled out of some small shipment, so I cut two donut shapes the same size as the earcups and slid them under the flap of the existing padding. That doubled the padding and is firm enough that it won't compress. Now they're fine on my ears and I should be able to wear them for a few hours at least. I'm only giving them 3 stars because I compared them to my Bose noise-cancelling ones, which I save for when I really need them, and they cut out a lot of high-range treble, including stuff that you really want to make sure is NOT in your mix. So they should work fine, with the caveat that I need to do a final check with the Bose. I wish manufacturers would put in some kind of adjustment for people with wider heads. I will add that the headband is extremely comfortable, much better than the Bose, and that's nice to see in an economy headphone."}
{"review":"I got this as a gift for someone so I can't comment on the quality but from what they've told me, this being their very first pair of over the ear headphones, they love it. Love the sound quality."}
{"review":"I just received these today. I am already incredibly impressed by the quality behind them and their sound. Everything is so clear and loud with great bass as well as highs.\n\nPros:\nGreat size, cover my ears perfectly and do not clamp onto your head like some reviewers have said.\nSoft ear cushions; They are very soft and comfortable for extended wear.\nSound: Great range of sounds put out. Clear notes.\nLong Cord: allows me to use it with my desktop computer without having to buy an extension for it.\nDurable Cord: Thick cord that is also very movable. Will post updates in the coming weeks on how it holds up.\n\nCons:\nNone so far.\n\nRecommendation:\nI really recommend these as a great pair of intro headphones that won't break the bank! Buy them and you will not be disappointed."}
{"review":"These were purchased for my 18 years old son who is a professional drummer in a Metal Band.  He loves them. Clear spectrum of frequencies.  Great bass response without being over bearing.  Very satisfied."}
{"review":"They are large and clunky (to be expected), but I don't carry them with me to use on the go, so that's just fine for me. Audio quality is exceptional. Fits great over the ear. Comes with an adapter for larger ports."}
{"review":"These headphones are decent for the price but my ears do start to hurt after wearing these any longer than an hour.  Also the sound canceling is not very good...I can hear people talking when using these."}
{"review":"I bought these on an impulse after reading CNET's listing of top headphones under $100. For $40, I am amazed at the quality of the sound these produce. Now, depending on what you're looking for, you might not be satisfied witih them. You can tell that these are studio monitor headphones because they have a very balanced sound - bass doesn't dominate (and can sound underwhelming if you are used to Beats or Monster headphones), and mids and highs come through clearly. Listening to Eluveitie's Helvetios album, I was hearing instruments that I never realized were there on my Monster Turbines.\n\nMy only gripe is that the cord is LOOOOOOONG. It's an easy 7 or 8 feet: way too long for use commuting in the subway. But it's great for use at my PC at work, as the cord easily reaches down to my tower's A\/V plug while still giving me plenty of slack to move about my desk. It would have been nice if they had a detachable cord and shipped with a shorter length for commuting use."}
{"review":"Let me start with something I must not have read - the cord on these is seriously like 10 or 15 feet.  It is LONG.  LONG, long, long!  Not the walking around listening to your tunes kind of headphones.  I bought them for my 13 year old.  He thinks the cord is funny.  We don't know what to do with it all.\n\nThe cord aside, the sound is AMAZE BALLS!  As a mom, I can say that I can't hear his music like I normally can when he's listening at a fairly high volume.  The sound is so clear and the music and other audio books sound absolutely perfect.  I don't have to partake in his listening pleasure - so I love that.  But that cord.  Seriously, it's crazy.  Maybe it's mean for sitting behind some big mixing board where you have to go far away from the audio source?  No idea.  But, just be warned."}
{"review":"These headphones are super comfortable and easily adjustable. They can be worn for hours on end without any problems.\nThe sound quality, overall, is pretty good. They're not the best, but they're pretty high quality for the price I got them for when it was on sale.\nThe cord is really long and you might want a twist tie or something to help manage it, but it's thick and durable.\nI would definitely recommend these headphones to someone."}
{"review":"I thought for the price, they can't be that great. My picky audiophile husband loves them and won't take them off. I wonder if that has to do with me nagging him about the dishes, hmmm......"}
{"review":"I have to say that i just love these, period. I got them on sale for $30 and i have to say they sound better than other more expensive ones like B&W or HK. After a while they feel a little uncomfortable however that might be just me"}
{"review":"Purchased for my movies,... I am not an audiophile so keep in mind, but find the sound to be very good. Reasonably noise- eliminating, but not totally. The top band needs to be re-positioned every hour or less because it puts pressure on the top of my head. Perhaps a piece of foam underneath will help Hmmm... Also, my ears hurt from the pads and I've had for about a year now. Lot of stretching apart helped, but was afraid they would snap.  (Did not).  Would I purchase again?  Probably so, because another brand might not sound as good and from everyone's reviews, seems impossible to find a set of phones that fit everyone.... All in all, pretty happy with these.  Extension cord was necessary for TV though, as existing cord is short."}
{"review":"These are a very good sounding headphones, but beware that the cord is EXTREMELY LONG, I mean its way to long. But its nice for the price."}
{"review":"Don't get this. its not loud at all. Don't believe the the 5 stars and the 4 stars b\/c they get $20 or something  for giving a good review... smh."}
{"review":"this is what I was looking. The soft fit, and exallent sound. It also reaches  to my recliner, with more  cord left over. An excellant pick for anyone who loves soft fit, and great sound:-)"}
{"review":"I found these headphones to be cofortable. They seal well over the ear, to stop distracting outside noise.\nYou can still hear other sounds, but muffled. Found it easy to focus on the clear quality of speakers.\nI found them loud enough, and did not have to turn up volume to max.\nProbably not for people that want to destroy their eardrums."}
{"review":"headphones replaced old pair of ear buds. For the price these headphones sound great, have solid bass and highs are clear and crisp. these are a buy for sure...."}
{"review":"Love these.  Great quality, comfortable, great sound.  I am not an audiophile super picky person, but I am a musician and I care.  These are nice."}
{"review":"We use these for podcasting, and recording demos and small things for blogs and 3D graphics, and these headphones have been great with no static or problems so far after ten months of consistent use."}
{"review":"Just got this today, so what I say is based on first impressions.\nFirst, the cord is very long.... very... long.  I might actually have to keep some of it tied up so it doesn't get tangled.\nSecond, I love that it has a 2nd connector adaptor.  One for your computer or small audio devices... even cameras.  And another that's larger for recording studio use and larger cameras.\nThirdly, The sound it truly brilliant.  It's truly stereo, so you hear everything in whatever you're listening to.  I only ever came across one other pair of headphones that I liked more in that respect and it was a Behringer.  Still, the Behringer wasn't nearly as sturdy.\n\nLike: I have big ears, so its nice to have something that will fit over them and not make them want to fall off after an hour.  Also, I've killed at least 2 pairs of headphones to wiring and cord issues.  It'll be nice to have a pair that has a thicker cord and is a bit harder to kill.\n\nDislike: The reason I give it 4 stars is because it isn't as compatible w\/ my Mac computer as I'd like.  Like many headphones, this set of headphones requires you to find that \"sweet spot\" when you plug it in to a MacBook Pro, or you won't actually hear the full potential it has... you might just hear a single instrument.  I'm sure at least a couple other people can relate to this problem.  However, as I've found that this problem can be fixed by tucking the cord under my laptop, I'd say its still a great set of headphones."}
{"review":"The noise around me is not completely shut out; - I can still hear some talking.  However, the product is pretty nice; and the price was especially good - sold for $41.  The quality of the sound is good for the price.  If you want perfect sound, you should spend more.  For my needs, it's good."}
{"review":"Works great for my purpose of listening to books or movies on the Kindle. They do not block out background noise as well as the $200 competitor, but look at the price difference. These are better than others in this price range."}
{"review":"I bought this as a gift for my dad. The sound quality is good, they are very comfortable, light. They look good too. My dad looks like a dj when he watches videos form YouTube on his iPad with these on. They are affordable enough, sound good, and feel comfortable. Unless you are a crazy 'soundphobe', I think you'll be happy with these headphones."}
{"review":"Some reviews I read claimed the ear pads weren't thick enough and caused ear discomfort. With my relatively small ears I haven't had this problem, and I've been wearing them for roughly two hours now. And while the very high vocal notes are a little less full than I would prefer, they sound very decent overall. If you listen to a lot of dubstep or electronic music I wouldn't recommend this pair of headphones, but for everyone else these should be more than sufficient."}
{"review":"These headphones are great for everyday use. Sounds are crispr and they block external noise exceedingly well. Definitely on par with more expensive Sennheiser DJ headphones I have used in the past and rotating\/fold able ear cups are a definite plus!"}
{"review":"Nothing bad to say about product.  Great price for a nice pair of headphones.  Cord is nice and long, if you're streaming you can move around without chaos."}
{"review":"Purchased as a gift for my nephew for Christmas...he really loved them...they are very sturdy and you can't hear any excess noise through them..........He told me they were very clear...I hope they last a long time..."}
{"review":"I bought these as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. They have amazing quality for such affordable headphones. We have 3 little girls, and these actually manage to cancel out their noise so you can hear the music too! ;) The cord is a little long for just home entertainment purposes but not a deal breaker. I don't know how we'll go back to using earbuds after having these!"}
{"review":"Decent response. The long cord is handy. However, the cups become slightly painful after wearing for more than ten minutes. This is likely because they don't cup the ear, but instead press on the edges of the ear. For the price, they were okay."}
{"review":"I urge you to purchase these headphones. They have great sound . The bass and high notes come out clear and crisp and the price is amazing. Save your money and buy these!"}
{"review":"If you are looking for a great set of over ear headphones at an excellent value then these are for you. Quality construction with a very long 11' cord and gold plated standard plug. Excellent for studio type listening."}
{"review":"While looking around for a gift for my hubby for Christmas, I spotted these.  I read the reviews of these and a few other headphones and eventually chose these.  The price was good and they seemed like the right choice for his needs.  Our computers are side by side and sometimes he wants to watch and listen to sports on his computer while I'm watching a movie or listening to music.  So, when Christmas came and he opened his package, his big smile told me everything.  He had previously bought some cheap headphones and they bit the dust rather quickly.  He plugged this one into his computer and away he went!  He absolutely loves them!  He said they aren't completely sound canceling but for the most part when he's tuned into a game on his computer, he can't hear what I'm doing right next to him.  I only wish they had come with some kind of case so our cat won't chew the cord.  But I have the box they came in and that will do for now until I can get (or make) something else."}
{"review":"I like this set of headphones. They work well when doing studio work and recordings which is why I purchased them. The low end is not the best so, if you are looking to blast some thumpin,\nbumpin, hip hop this my not be your best choice. They say Professional Studio Monitor phones and that is what they work best for. Nice phones, good price."}
{"review":"I've had these for a few days now, and I really like them a lot. Don't know if A-T could've actually justified $135, but with my Prime account, and @ $50, I'm IMPRESSED. While not noise cancelling, they are amazingly quiet. The cups are comfortable. My Son tried them and now, he wants a pair. We both found that they are musician headphones, not gaming headphones. The sound is very balanced. They remind me of my now defunct Koss Pro-4AA's. Try them, I think you'll like them."}
{"review":"Great sound, I love the long cord, and it comes with a 1\/4 inch plug adaptor.  Blocks outside noise somewhat due to the cushioning. Very comfortable since I use them for extended periods of time."}
{"review":"For the price it's excellent. Fits great and sounds great. Cuts out some sound. Would definitely recommend and will be getting my wife a pair"}
{"review":"I bought these as a Christmas gift for my son after reading about headphones for under $100 on CNET. They have a good sound and the price was right."}
{"review":"Ok, let me confess I had to send them back. No, it was the sound quality or charity, not comfort or frequency. The fact is, I was quit impressed especially with the flat clarity. You could actually here some of the low volume background that was pretty amazing. As with any device it is all in what your looking for. If you looking for vibrant sound you might want to weigh the high clarity you get from these however for an inexpensive set of head phones I'd say take a good look.\n\nNow the unfortunate thing with these was what I was looking for. I read the sound room and the isolation phrase in the description and that is where my version and the authors of other reviews clashed. For what ever reason the unit I got provide nothing. The wife and grandson where sitting 10' away speaking in normal tone and I might as well been sitting next to them. Fact is I have some Sony headphone and they came with no isolation, recording room or any other idea of some background limiting function which work 100x better. So, I'll rate them as a 4 star as long as your not counting on this use. They are impressive headphones for what they do."}
{"review":"DO NOT BUY! Don't believe the hype. These headphones are garbage. Usually I trust the massive amounts of customer reviews on any product, but this one truly sucks. The sheer amount of people that are buying these headphones I think are just trusting the previous reviews and it has caused a snowball effect on the sales. The truth is the sound distorts at low levels (the low levels it can even reach) and they are not loud AT ALL!!! I am not picky and I don't want some extremely loud kind of headphones, but these are really low volume. I have many headphones laying around my house that cost $20 that sound way better than these. The very long and high quality chord makes people think the headphones are of high quality, nothing could be further from the truth! I verified this by playing the headphones on many devices around my house. Again, the sound quality is mediocre at best and the loss of amplification and volume make these headphones worthless. Don't waste your money! Whenever I buy something from Amazon I do exactly what you are doing. I shop for ones that have the most good customer reviews, then I cross reference the customer reviews and make sure there is hardly any 1 or 2 star reviews. That's what I did with these headphones. DO NOT BUY!"}
{"review":"Purchased while on sale.  Great price, and well worth the original asking price.  I'm using them to monitor recordings and edit audio, and have been working perfect for that.  Exceptional range and clarity.  They are not super heavy on the low end, so might leave you wanting more if you're working with beat production or techno. A good comparison would be these are car audio they would be a 10\" subwoofer, perfect for rock\/alternative\/acoustic, where a 12\" would be best for techno\/beats\/etc. If you're looking for an intermediate level headphone for audio engineering or even just for listening, these are a great product."}
{"review":"The description of the headphones suggest they are only for listening professionals in the recording studio, I am not one of the those but these headphones satisfy my listening expectations. The sound quality is very good. I am very satisfied w\/ the base quality as well the dampening of surrounding noise. The fit of the headphones is very comfortable even for extended periods of time. Finally they are a great value for the dollar."}
{"review":"I read the reviews on these headphones and liked what I heard. It's true that they have great sound quality, but they pinch my head and are like wearing ear muffs. So if you have a small head and cold ears, you will like these headphones :-\/"}
{"review":"These headphones are incredibly sharp. Sharp sharp sharp. (were before burn in. Please read full review. Leaving at 3, but these are now 4 star in my opinion.. continuing):  In modern america, there seems to be a high association with good sound quality and its direct association with the upper treble. These phones have no mids. There just not there.  I wanted to think it was my equipment, so I hooked the headphones into a headphone amp to rule out being under powered.  No change. There was sufficient bass (decent quality bass this price point as well), and extremely sssssssharp treble. Sure you can hear detail and yes for this point you have good base....but it leaves so much to be desired from an audiophile standpoint. I know what people are saying above: don't listen to those who are complaining and give these headphones a poor rating. I bought the headphones and made the choice to purchase based on the many great reviews.  I can see how many are quickly satisfied with them. You have the \"crip detail\" and the tight bass, but where is the rest of it? The mids are a HUGE part of the overall sound experience and there not there.  Im telling you if you are looking for a decent pair of headphones and want mids as well, don't look to these.\n\nWhat are you planning on using headphones for? Do you like to use them by your computer, or do you want something to travel. My principle need was for computer listening (music, and gaming)....for only a little more you could get a nice pair of sennheiser 518s and be blown out of the water. Sure there is more sound leakage with the 518s, but I welcome it for audio fidelity.  You might also consider the Superlux HD668B, or the Audio-Technica ATH-AD500X. Open ended is where im headed. Not as much isolation but clarity wise in terms of imaging (hearing distinction of instramentation), that's where you will find it. Here is a good explanation of the two if your brain is having just as much of a headache as mine was in my long headphone search: [...]\n\nEDIT #1: Well apparently burn in really does make a difference with headphones. I put the volume on medium and played pink noise out of these for about 10 hours.(Not too much above normal listening comfort). Now there not nearly as harsh and beginning to sound more balanced...But still not to my liking (keep reading). They still lack the mids and the treble drivers themselves still tend to be on the harsh side...but not nearly as bad as the lazer piercing I lost my inner ear drum harshness that I first heard out of the box... the detail in music is coming out more than it was before.  ill have to update in this week after the 100 hour mark with pink noise running every night for 8 hours at medium volumes.\n\nEDIT #2:  Two days later: Mids are finally coming forward.  Enough for me to rate it a 4 star at this point. Ill still leave it here at three so people can see why I originally put it at three. Still a little too strong of a treble emphasis, but the detail is also more present now. Now the mids are at least there and the treble has calmed itself. They are worth it for around the 40 dollar price range...though if your picky and are looking for a higher fidelity consider spending the extra 50-60 and going for the KNS 8400S.  Those cans are steller. These will do the trick if your looking for an over the ear headphone that is much better than your iphone or Samsung earphones...but if your looking for something with more mids, and truer fidelity, I stand behind that while GREATLY improved with burn in, they still have that treble emphasis...though again now my ears are healing from there out of the box state....burn in with headphones is real. pink noise on youtube. Run it around listening volumes or slightly higher (not unbearable volumes) and leave it over night and let it stand. Dont run it 24 hours. Every night plug it in and let it go over night.  They keep sound in very well when cupped together.  I probably have around 25 hours by this point. So if there is any further improvement I will post."}
{"review":"These headphones ruuuule I've had them for twice as long now as any other pair I've owned, they're comfortable and portable because they sort of collapse in and get smaller when you take them off (in a good way). The sound is spot on and the bass is significant. When music is turned on they do very well at keeping sound out. Also the cord isn't too long like sennheisers (crew those things). HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"review":"The increase in quality from my standard s4 headphones to this is well worth, I can hear different parts of songs (bass, backup singers, and drums) They now make as big of a statement as the main instruments (vocals, and guitar)\nThere is a slight issue with the headphones but I took care of it quickly.\nSince they are meant for studio listening\/recording whatever the cable is more than 3 yards long!(not exaggerating)\nNot an issue, however because when they arrive the cable is wrapped.\nSo unwrap to the desired length and retie a little knot and you're good to go.\nThey are also nice for personal use on computers."}
{"review":"These were a gift so I have not used them myself. The giftee says the headphones are comfortable and have a good dynamic range. I bought them based on the brand name and reviews I found online. For the money they are a good set of headphones."}
{"review":"Pros:  Great sound and a very comfortable fit, even after hours of use.\n\nCons:  The leather on the ear pads seems a little thin\n\nAwesome headphones if you are shopping on a budget but still looking for a solid product."}
{"review":"Beautiful sound. The only reason because i rate ir with 4 stars it is because the wire. Is too long and there is not a volume control.  By the way the headphone has amazing sound!!!!"}
{"review":"THESE THINGS SOUND FANTASTIC!  There only flaw is they are a little tight on the head. But, it's no reason to give them less than 5 stars"}
{"review":"The audio is clear, it fits well and is extremely comfortable while worn. I am very pleased and it was well worth the money spent. :)"}
{"review":"Headphones seal nicely and make me think that they are active electronic noise canceling instead of passive. Flat frequency response with distinct and punchy lows. Great headphones for the money."}
{"review":"The Audio-Technica ATH-M30 headphones have met all my expectations.  The sound quality and clarity are excellent.  The phones are comfortable to wear for long periods and the design is simple without noise cancelling which usually requires batteries.  The sound insulation is good with minimal outside noise interference. Audio frequency response is outstanding - you will hear many sounds which are not reproduced in other headphones. The sound does not pass beyond the headphone cups so others in a room are not disturbed. I would recommend these phones to anyone looking for a reasonably priced set with excellent sound reproduction!"}
{"review":"Whether you are commuting, out listening to your MP3 player or on the road traveling, the Audio Technica headphones are extremely comfortable, lightweight and most importantly offer strong performance for their size and cost. If you are weighing picking up a new set, these should be on your list to consider."}
{"review":"these fit great, a little tight as some have mentioned, but I only wear for an hour maybe two for playback purposes.  nice to eliminate some of the external noise which creates a more focused experience.  going from a radio station to home studio seems to be great, but have not done a side by side comparison.  for playback of recorded voice material, works great."}
{"review":"They're not as comfortable as my pair of Sony MDR V6's, and the ridiculously long non-coiled cord is a pain to deal with all the time"}
{"review":"The headphones are very good. They are pretty comfortable and the long cord is easily tied up to make it short enough for mobile use. The closed-back design insulates you from outside noise and there is very little leakage of sound to the environment. The unit was purchased for an individual was a small head size and she was wearing the headphones immediately for hours!"}
{"review":"I use this for my synth setup and it gives good lows and all around good sound. I also use it on the airplane to drown out noise and crank up my tunes without much sound escaping to bother others. It is not noise canceling but it works for me!"}
{"review":"These headphones are quite comfortable compared to other models in my opinion and I find myself being able to listen for sounds better in After Effects when I am doing animations."}
{"review":"Overall performance.... 5 stars. sound, appearance and construction is superb. I bought this one with the  Qinpu a6000 amps and boy what a blast.nice Christmas gifts from my wife. Definitely recommended.\nManny from Minnesota"}
{"review":"I purchased these after reading other reviews. I am quite pleased. The cups fit fine over my ears, and they fit comfortably on my big head. Sound- not bad at all. Over all, again- nice product for the price."}
{"review":"I like these a lot; have only tried them for working at home without bothering family.  Probably not right for a really long plane trip, nor for napping.  But the sound seems just fine."}
{"review":"Comfortable and good sound in comparison to the little headphones that are so common, Lite weight for their size and a long cord. When the foam covers wear off your little ones buy these and treat yourself."}
{"review":"Great head phones.\nvery light weight\namazing sound quality (i've spent over $150 for worse sound)\n\nonly issue it the over ear is a little small so your ears get a little smushed"}
{"review":"Ok, I put these on my wishlist after much debate and reading through various reviews of different headphones. Basically, I desired some nice, over-the-ear headphones for when I'm walking around campus. I live in a cold climate so I thought it would be a bonus of keeping my ears warmer while listening to some awesome tunes.\n\nI received them for Christmas from my mother-in-law and immediately tore into the packaging like an insatiable five year old. The first thing I noticed was the comfort. I HAVE A TON OF EAR PIERCING! I'm not talking a couple cute little things in my ear lobes, I'm talking gauges, industrial, the kind that make your mother hurry you past me while giving sideways glances because she's afraid if you get too close I might consume your soul....those kind of piercings. Needless to say that makes more over the ear headphones start to ache after only a few minutes due to the pressure. These are incredibly soft and while sturdy, don't feel like they are trying to squeeze your brains through your ears.\n\nAt this point, distracted by the comforters that now surrounded my ears, I hadn't even started turned them on yet. I then realized that they were not completely noise isolating. I could hear the squeals of delight coming from my sister-in-law as she opened one of her various gifties. This, however, was ok with me. Like I said, I was going to be wearing these while I walked around campus....I didn't want to get so enraptured in my music that I wouldn't hear the car that is veering toward me at break neck speeds due to the exhausted college student behind the wheel who fell asleep after an all night cram session for finals. This isn't to say that you can hear everything that goes on around you. Sounds become quite muffled and once I finally turned on some music I realized that most people became charlie brown's teacher, their words morphing into a droning \"mwuah mwuah mwuah\".\n\nNow to the big part. The music. I am going to say these are the second best pair of headphones I've ever owned as far as sound quality goes (the first being a pair of bose in ear headphones...so you know, that's kinda a high bar). I should also confess that spending more than $20 dollars on a pair of headphones for me is incredibly painful so high quality usually isn't something I consider. I admit, I am not a music snob. I don't really understand the difference in different highs, lows, etc. I will say that I had a pair of Lady Gaga Beats. I like these better though. They didn't seem to get tinny or rumbly at any point. Granted, I was listening to Florence and the Machine so I'm not sure how hard I was really pushing them.\n\nSo if you've just skipped past all my ramblings and want to know the gist of it, I rank as follows:\n\n1. Super comfy. Clouds have now formed around your ears and are kissing them softly into a joyous slumber. Would recommend for those with piercings.\n\n2. Not completely noise isolating, but doesn't do a bad job at cutting out background noise.\n\n3. Great sound for the money. I'm not a music savant, so I may be ignorant, but if your not one who looks at the technical specs of headphones you will probably really like these.\n\nAnd that's it. Why are you still reading? I don't have anything else to say about these headphones. Seriously, go away. Read a different review now. I'm done."}
{"review":"For the money, these are hard the beat.  When compared to my Bose noise-cancelling phones, these have 70-80% of the sound quality for a fraction of the cost.  These are a great option for home use where noise-cancellation isn't needed.  Sound is very clear in highs and mids, and the bass is sufficient for most music types."}
{"review":"I had heard these headphones once at a friends , knew of there quality but with the Roku TV system just un believeable,,!! At this price get them ,I bought two..\n\n  Sincerely , Zazou"}
{"review":"Bought these for my brother who actually left another pair behind at a hotel room. The ones he had were more expensive. He said the sound on these is amazing. He said he can't get the music to blast super loud, but the bass is good and the sound is clear. And they are super-comfortable to wear."}
{"review":"I bought these headphones so I could study my online lectures and tune out 6 kids and 7 dogs in my house. They work !!!!! Yeah"}
{"review":"There is nothing negative that can be said about these headphones at the incredable price of $49. I use them for listening to my iPad\/PC. Great bass, clear sound. Cord is very long. Purchased a second pair for my son"}
{"review":"ok so for the price (I paid $40) they are amazing headphones.\n\nAs far as headphones go though, eh, I duno..... I can tell the difference between these and my old ones.\n\nThe pads are a bit hard on the head as a few others have mentioned so wearing them for an extended period of time becomes noticeable.  As for the quality of sound, it's a bit \"tinny\", not sure how else to explain that.  I can tell.\n\nI would buy these again for the price but not for the quality... I'd aim higher if you're looking for a high quality pair."}
{"review":"Received the headphones as a Christmas gift.  I had to search the house for my socks after my first use. ( Blew my socks off!)  I'm not in anyway an expert, but as a consumer I whole heartedly recommend this unit!"}
{"review":"I wanted these headphones to use when I am at home or in one place for a while, I have several Bluetooth headphones that are good for when I do not what to be bothered with the wires but there are some drawbacks with Bluetooth devices.\n\nI like the sound quality and the price was great, I know that there are many headphones out there that are probably better but for the price that I wanted to pay these really work great.  I keep them handy so that I can use them with my Macbook Pro and the cord is long enough so that I can plug them into my home stereo system and enjoy my music without disturbing the others in the house.\n\nGreat product for a reasonable price!"}
{"review":"I find that I am amazed at the rich sound quality when I am listening to music. When I am watching streaming video I am able to concentrate more of the action."}
{"review":"I bought these after a lot of research and what I was satisfied with after getting them was that they're not too pricy, very comfortable, super long cord, great sound."}
{"review":"The sound coming from these headphones is fantastic. I'm NOT an audiophile, but wanted something nice as normal earplugs make my ears sore if I try to use them all day at work. I'm hearing things I never heard before on my good tracks, and wishing I had better MP3's for some of my other tracks as it's now obvious they are low quality.\n\nI have a normal sized head, but these headphones are still slightly too large on their smallest setting. I've NEVER been accused of having a small head. To clarify that, the amount of 'pinch' is good, but I can't shrink how far down the ears hang from the headstrap quite enough. If your head is even remotely able to be considered 'small', these won't fit! I was hoping the kids could use these on the electric piano too -- but there's no way.\n\nThat said, my ears are also fairly normal, nothing 'dumbo' here...but my ears would have appreciated a slightly larger cavity for earphones that are supposed to go around the outside of your ears.\n\nWould have liked the padding to be slightly thicker as well on the ears.\n\nNot sure if this is just a 'live with it' thing for all circum-aural headsets, but my ears do get too hot in these, so all-day listening is still out."}
{"review":"Bought these as a gift for someone who doesn't have another set of over the ear headphones.  They are a good quality for the price."}
{"review":"-Pros\nBest sound I have ever heard coming from headphones\nBeats my Turtle Beaches easily\nCheap and has a long cord\nComes with adapter\nThick cord for heavy duty use\n\n-Cons\nDoesnt fit my ears very well, but you cant really account for everybody.\n\nAll in all, you cant go with anything better for this price, amazing quality at Audio-Technica"}
{"review":"My brother loved them was a christmas present for him. I don't know much about audio eqipment but he says they are great, one day use so far, will update if he finds an issue"}
{"review":"Between the rave reviews and the (marked down) high price, I was expecting a lot better.  There's an excess of base and the treble is off.  They aren't bad enough to return but I've owned much clearer headphones that were much less expensive than these, albeit without the muffs.  The cable for them is too long, a strange problem to have, but it really is.  If I had got these at Best Buy or somewhere with convenient returns, I'd probably return them, but since it's harder to mail them back, I'll just keep them for now."}
{"review":"The sound quality was pretty good for the price.  The jack broke off in my laptop though during the second week  from just unplugging it."}
{"review":"A very nice sub $50 set.  I just rose a star while writing this review, because you have to consider price and quality as well.  I don't think the quality is easy to match at this price...  Maybe a Sennheiser set can match the quality price ratio.  I bought this set for using Apple's Logic with my new Nektar keyboard, and also for gaming.  It represents sound very well... but for games I would recommend maybe one of those amplified headsets like turtle beach which has been designed not for accurate sound but to tweak it to sound good on games, for exaggerated bass...  I just add all this stuff to tell you that these are a multi purpose very accurate set."}
{"review":"Purchased for my wife who mostly likes computing\/surfing and they are way better than I thought they'd be. She uses them all the time and they just fit like a glove and work like a woman!"}
{"review":"To start, I am not an audiophile. I like all sorts of music and can appreciate the warmer differences between vinyl and more modern means of music listening. That illustrates all of my knowledge when it comes to sound.\n\nThat being said, these are unreal. Maybe I just had lower quality speakers around me my whole life (not entirely true, I have a pair of klipsch bookshelf speakers that will be going unused now) but these added another dimension to some of my favorite tracks. Little things I didn't notice before in songs now stand out.\n\nBottom line, I bought these for myself and after i'm finished with this review, im ordering 3 more pairs for Christmas."}
{"review":"Professional quality at an affordable price.\nThe adjustable cushioned headband and lightweight design make these headphones really comfortable.\nBecause of the design they also isolate ambient noise to an extent.\nLove them !"}
{"review":"I bought these for silent guitar practice. Im using them on a vox stomplab and they do a fine job. They are a great buy for budget headphones."}
{"review":"I guess it was because something about the phone jack was wrong. But when I plugged it in, the sound was not clear at all. I had to pull the 1\/8 inch out a little bit in order to hear an ok quality sound. Very inconvenient."}
{"review":"these m30 head phones have replaced a pare of beats studio phones, they are lighter and cover ears better. no batteries to change every 2 weeks.the sound is better more mid range and no bass boost cleaner over all."}
{"review":"I'm not at all an audiophile, so I can't really speak too much to the audio quality of these headphones, but it's certainly better than any headphones that I own.  I bought some velour earpads to go with them, but even with those, these headphones really hurt my ears after an hour or so."}
{"review":"Works great, long cord, fits over ears (man ears) and great sound. Not as good as real noise cancelling head phones but they do indeed help."}
{"review":"I have tried a wide variety of headphones, and these are the best headphones under $100.  They are light, the cord is very sturdy (the cord broke on my Sennheiser hd 203), the sound is very crisp, with bass response that is clear and powerful but not muddy.\n\nBetter in every way than beats, and the best value.  If you don't want to shell out for the ATH-M50, get these."}
{"review":"My in-laws live in Hawaii and I live in Michigan, so long flights are common for me.  I simply couldn't bring myself to fork over enough money for high end noise-cancelling headphones like Bose.  I gave these a try based on all the positive reviews.  Here is what I found on my first flight:\n\nThese headphones cancel out about 50% of the airplane engine noise.  This simply does not compare to what noise-cancelling headphones from BOSE and the like have to offer.  However, it was more than adequate to comfortably listen to music from my tablet during the flight without blowing my eardrums out like I have in years past.  As it turns out, the approx 50% reduction in noise was sufficient and I am content with these as a cheap pair of airplane head phones.  It also does a good job of muting out conversations going on around you on the plane, esp with music playing.\n\nAs others have notes, the sound quality itself can't be beat."}
{"review":"Overall sound quality is good, so can't really complain about that. I'm not that picky regarding sound quality like other reviewers.\nThe one thing that is a little disappointing is the fit over my ear. I think I have a medium sized year, and a portion of the foam is always touching the year directly, no matter what position it's in.\nThe cable tangles a bit because it has no \"spirals\" but other than that it works pretty decently."}
{"review":"I was shopping for a pair of mid range headphone to replace my old SONY one. This has given me a pleasant surprise when I plug it into the headphone jack, and listen to my usual collection. It give me the kind of resolution and depth that I will only expect from headphones a few time more expensive. The fit is also very comfortable. The only drawback is that it come with a very long cord, much longer than usual, and that's it!"}
{"review":"Cant beat it for the price.  Bose for $299?!?! Yeah thats not happening, i bought some Sonys locally but fit ontop of the ear and uncomfortable, these go over the ear and sound great"}
{"review":"Years ago I had a pair of Pro-AA headphones but have not needed to use headphones until very recently. These are great! And the 10-foot cord makes it easy for me to sit on the sofa across from the sound system. Excellent quality, reasonable price, and a good choice."}
{"review":"I've used these headphones for a few months now and must say that while they work fine, aside form the ear covers making a crackling sound when I wear them, they work OK. But the design is less than stellar -- the ear cups are loose fitting and the overall feel is cheap and tacky."}
{"review":"Just one word amazing!!!\n\nnothing more to say, if you want a good quality of sound for the right price this is the best option"}
{"review":"My brother is kind of obsessed with sound, around these days. He was looking for some good piece of good range, neutral and clear sounding headphones. I invited him to test my ATH-M30, and he got in love with them instantly! So I gave them to him, and then ordered mine again!"}
{"review":"Wow! I bought these for my wife and she was extremely thrilled.  She often comments that I sometimes buy her closeout items that no one else wants just because it was on sale or clearance, but this time the quality exceeded the deal.  Thanks for helping me bring confidence back in my marriage, now that's sexy."}
{"review":"These are really good headphones. Great range of sounds, great bass, really good clarity. I like how they designed the cord to only go into one end, this reduces tangling and catching the cord with your hands. With the metal band and the metal spiral on the cord these should last a long time with normal wear and tear. They have pretty good padding and fit comfortably, though it would help if the padding on the band was a little thicker.\n\nThis is the best value I've seen on headphones of this style. Of course there are better ones available, but you'd pay 4x the price for maybe a 10% gain. For the average consumer looking for very good headphones with a very good sound, these are ideal."}
{"review":"Sound quality is nothing special. I have earbuds that sound better.  The right ear has a buzz and sounds like the speaker is blown. If I didn't have to pay the return shipping I would send them back. Not happy"}
{"review":"Don't get me wrong, for the sale price I got them at they are probably the best headphones I've ever bought. But they're not the end all be all headphones.... maybe I'm not yet used to them but the volume to me seems kinda weak. I have turn up the volume kinda high to get a good volume. I listen to a lot of classical music and non auto tune singing and that is crisp and clear. When you get to dubstep and autotune music the sound kinda loses a tad bit.... I got these mostly to hook up to my TV and listen to music and they are pretty amazing for that."}
{"review":"For the price I don't think headphones get any better than this.  These are hands down the best headphones I've ever used.... I can NEVER go back go my $5 pair of \"iPOD \""}
{"review":"I am not an audiophile but I know what sounds good to me. These headphones sound great and the price can't be beat. If you're looking for headphones under $50 I would highly recommend the ATH-M30's. Quality craftsmanship here folks! (and the cord is nice & long)"}
{"review":"Bought it half the price on sale. Pretty good investment with excellent high, low, mid, and bass. The volume is slightly lower than my studio yamaha, but 65 impedance works well, compared with 120. I have to use the largest headband setting in order for my head to fit, but overall it is extremely comfortable like wearing nothing for a long time, in fact I can wear it all day long without taking it off. The headband adjustment is made of metal, very durable. However, when you adjust it, do not pull on the ear cup or the wire attached, but instead the metal band. Considering this is on sale now on Amazon, I would even purchase a second one."}
{"review":"I looked at a Panasonic pair similar in price and these are much clearer. I use the to drown out people around me.. They are not noise canceling headphones but have a clear sound with a good bass kick. I don't need crazy over powering bass headphones. This are well worth the money and comfortable."}
{"review":"This was a present for my son but he has informed me that it is everything that he wanted.  He had picked out the product on Amazon's website and even though we live in Australia, he wanted that particular product.  He said that it performs as advertised and is very pleased with it."}
{"review":"I loved this set because of how comfortable and easy they were to just slip on!  My 75 year old father and my 7 year old son both use them and absolutely love the comfort.  That says a lot for a picky 75 year old and a spoiled (yet awesome) 7 year old.  Enjoy!  Bummed that there's no mic on these to use as phone as well."}
{"review":"What else can be said about these that hasn't already been said in the past comments? Cord is a little preposterously long but eh, Ive managed to live with in now"}
{"review":"They are very good headphones for the price! Not much to say bad about them.  If I do have something I will update the review."}
{"review":"The sound quality is great. The fit is over the complete ear is very comfortable and snug, does not slide forward. Especially like the long cord, so that I can move around when needed."}
{"review":"These are very nice headphones.  I have hearing loss and ringing in my ears so need to have TV, Computer, etc. quite loud to hear without my hearing aids.  I can plug these headphones in and listen as loud as I want and not bother anyone else in the house."}
{"review":"These headphones are awesome. Buy these headphones because they are awesome. Georgie is great! Georgie is my cat and he agrees these headphones are awesome."}
{"review":"This headphones did not meet my expectations and I ended up returning them.\n\nwhile they are comfortable, the quality of the sound is not what I expected from \"professional studio monitor\" headphone. Everything is mushy, no definition in the mid-range and no pop in the higher range.\n\nWould not recommend"}
{"review":"For me, these were not comfortable to use, they applied quite a bit of pressure to my ears when worn, I could only wear them for 10-20 minutes max before my ears were too sore. The sound quality is great for the price, I just which they were more comfortable"}
{"review":"Sent these to my eighteen year old son who is a Music Education major. Unlike current trendy brands, these are reasonably priced.  They are great for life in the dorm and deliver quality sound.  Be aware however, the cord is extra long"}
{"review":"Great product for the price. These are a big improvement over my old headset. I operate a camera and do video editing and they allow some room to move around."}
{"review":"Okay, so first let me state that this is not a payed review. I just simply love these headphones. Super comfortable and I can wear them for hours without my ears hurting. The sound is amazing and very clear with a super super good booming bass. I could use a little extra noise cancellation from the outside world but it isn't an issue I'd give it a lower rating for.\n\nSUPER GOOD HEADSET!"}
{"review":"I purchased these years ago and they're still going strong. The outside cover on the earpads wore off pretty quickly, but it doesn't detract from their comfort"}
{"review":"I bought both these and the ATH-M20 headphones, and i have to say that these have by far better sound. These and the 20's have same comfort and same durability. But if you're looking for something with very crisp high's and a nice solid low end get these. They might be 15 bucks more, but it is well worth it."}
{"review":"got this head set to replace my other set that had a short cord , this cord is long and the adapter that goes in both jacks....."}
{"review":"These are very comfortable to wear with the padding and they adjust easily.  The sound and clarity is amazing for the price I paid.  I like all kinds of music and they sound just as great with classical as they do metal.  Well worth the price. Side note.. the packaging is refreshingly easy to open by just pulling it open."}
{"review":"Headphones sound really nice, have very good lows mids. Bass is marginally lacking in my opinion.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the tightness of the headphones. I personally can't wear them more than 30 min or so before it starts hurting because of the tightness. Maybe it won't be bad once they're broken in."}
{"review":"I am extremely impressed with the sound quality of the Audio-Technical ATH-M30 headphones. The rich base and crisp clear sound is unbelievable, especially for the price. Don't waste your money on over priced headphones."}
{"review":"These are great!!!  I bought them to use with Rocksmith on the Xbox.  Rocksmith has a delay issue unless you go through headphones or alternate speakers bypassing the TV.  These are perfect because of the length and durability of the cord.\n\nThese headphones also come with a large adapter that screws on so that I can plug these into my amp when i want to practice without the game.\n\nThese are loud and clear.  These things blow my Turtle Beaches out of the water as far as clarity and loudness.\nThey fit great and are comfortable around the ear."}
{"review":"I ordered these thinking they would be higher quality audio than a Logitech G35 but they just aren't. I was hoping to replace them because the G35 is so heavy on my head but I was very unimpressed by the quality on these."}
{"review":"For $47 and free two day shipping using Prime, this headset is a great purchase. I got these and compared to my previous clip-over-the-ear-psp-ear-pieces this headset is beast! I then made some adjustments to the options available on my computer stereo to make the headphones sound even better. Tip: Go to stereo icon - click on it - click on the audio icon above the level of sound - click on enhancements in the stereo properties - check pitch shift [put on zero] - check equalizer [put on powerful to make it sound like your are there in the music or in the video] - check headphone virtualization - check loudness equalization - and uncheck environment and voice cancellation. You can play with the environment options but I personally think the sound sounds better when it is unchecked. In the end, for the price, this headset is a must have."}
{"review":"These headphones have held up longer than any other pair I have owned (which is a lot)!  I highly recommend these for recording and light mixing.  Also good for cross referencing your monitor mix!"}
{"review":"My God,\n\nAfter ordering these and waiting for them to arrive I was experiencing a pang of buyers remorse. Should I have stuck with my original Sennheiser HD201s and bought another pair? Moments after trying these babies out my purchase was validated. The headphones pump out rich layers of sound that sound much better then their price tag. Though I'm no audiophile I highly recommend anyone looking to increase their headphone quality on the cheap.\n\n(One downside is that you can't run in these :( I guess the $20 Sennheiser are better in one way after all.)"}
{"review":"Best headphones I have owned at any price and I have had some expensive headphones.\n\nGive these a try and you will not be disappointed."}
{"review":"Even I would be hard pressed to break these. The converter from 3.5 to the 6.whatever screws in. \/It screws in.\/ Where the cord goes into the metal jack part, it has a springy thing to keep the cord from breaking. Also, the cord is sO F-ING LONG. I will never again be pulled up short trying to reach something. Gorgeous full sound for the casual music listener. I mean, these say studio professional monitor or whatever. I believe it. I couldn't hear snapping right next to my ear unless the music was turned down to less than 10%. I think I have a new favorite thing aside from whiskers on kittens."}
{"review":"For the money, these headsets are wonderful.  They're not SUPER base-like, but I can sure hear the beat.  At first I thought the headset was a little tight but with wearing them on and off for two weeks, they've relaxed on to my head.  Clean crisp sound.  They are not billed as noise cancelling and are not noise cancellers, but they go pretty far to lessen noise.  If you were on an airplane with a fussy baby they'd sure help.  My music sounds strong and good--good enough for the price.  I get great sound but won't freak out if I drop them.  There is a spring protection coming out of the headphone which helps prevent bend-over in that spot.  They fit right into my MP3 player but the set came with the adapter to fit into my stereo receiver.  The cord is a bit too long for me since I walk around with my MP3 (rather than plugging into the stereo to walk around), but I just wrapped it with a covered wire to the length I want.  It's for this reason I did the 4 stars...the too long plug (which would be great for someone else)."}
{"review":"Rich sound, VERY comfortable, and a great price. There are some high end cans with better sound, but these beat some $200 units easily. Great buy."}
{"review":"Really good sound really good product at a cheap price looking for another pair I'm not a professional but this pair world good for me"}
{"review":"I am very happy with the sound quality and the comfort of the fit.  I would have given it a five star rating if it had a connection at the left earpiece to connect the main wire into the system.  Seems too easy to have it break off instead of just come undone.  It was a great buy for the price as an Amazon deal."}
{"review":"I'm ashamed to admit how much time I've spent reading headphone reviews trying to make an informed purchase decision - My ATH-M30s arrived on 11\/30 and I KNEW I had made a very good decision.  Guys if you are hung up about investing X, Y or Z dollars and just can't decide on which brand, I've got the answer.  The ATH-M30 cans are absolutely wonderful!  It's been a long time since I've made such a great decision in electronics.  Well made, sturdy, comfortable, lightweight, and just really hard to describe in terms of sound quality.  What more can I say?  Well, buy these high quality headphones and you WILL NOT be disappointed.  Thank you audio-technica for such a quality product at a very reasonable price."}
{"review":"best bang for the buck had to let it burn in for about 30hrs of listening or so, the sound is amazing and they really are comfortable to wear for long time, these are the most pricey head phones i have ever gotten so take my review for what ever it worth."}
{"review":"I own these headphones and frankly, they are the best for under $100. With a thick one sided cord and extremely tough headphones, these closed headphones eliminated the majority of external noise. The cups themselves are thick and soft padded that makes long duration listening comfortable, a padded head band, and they are made of hard plastic and metal that bends and doesn't seem like it will break anytime soon. Of course, as expected with Audio-Technica, sound quality and frequency response are amazing. The specs say 20Hz - 20 KHz, and I have yet to test the high end, the low end is beautiful and strong. If you watch a movie with these and a plane is in the background noises, don't be alarmed if you take the headphones off to make sure one didn't really fly nearby because your aren't alone. These are absolutely breathtaking for the sound quality to price ratio."}
{"review":"I haven't listened too much to them (about 5 minutes), but I wanted to do a preliminary review to get one thing straight: they are VERY comfortable. I know many reviewers here complain about the comfort, but my Sennheiser hd 202's I owned before the broke (which sounded great) were absolutely painful. I took these headphones out of the box and didn't even need to adjust them. They feel like clouds compared to the sennheisers."}
{"review":"These sound so good when running laptop through a DAC. Great imaging and very closed environment. Don't use if you need to hear others chatting around you."}
{"review":"I use these all the time, both in the house connected to my A\/V receiver and outside working in the yard.  It comes with a removable 1\/4\" plug that converts to an 1\/8\" plug (it screw on and off).  The sound quality is excellent and it does a great job blocking out noise.  I use these while mowing the lawn and can hear podcasts great.  They have also held up well under substantial use."}
{"review":"The design was perfect for me. It fits over my ears and the cushioning is very comfortable, making long listening sessions possible. I have glasses and it's still barely noticeable. The sound quality is very good for the price, and I've had it for more than half a year now. For the price I got it for, (around $30) I've been satisfied. Highly recommended."}
{"review":"The sound isn't bad and the headphone itself is pretty comfortable, but the wire is WAY too long. I wish it had an option to choose a shorter wire. I can only use this at home, and even then it's super uncomfortable when on the computer with it because the wires get all over the place."}
{"review":"I've owned these headphones for over two years for personal use, so I thought I would give my opinion.\n\nSound: I have no complaints on the sound. While you shouldn't expect these to be soundproof, the quality of sound from these headphones has been great.\n\nComfort: Not that great honestly. Early on, these headphones would create a lot of issues with my outer ears; they would feel very sore to touch. I had to put additional padding under the outer area, and even then it still isn't perfect. This is probably the biggest reason I am giving these headphones a 3\/5.\n\nDurability: As I said, I've had these headphones for over two years and am only now considering a replacement. Aside from the comfort issues I mentioned, the outer area is starting to wither away. I'll occasionally see some of the padding cover on my ears and neck when I take off the headphones. That being said, the headphones still sound pretty good for being so old.\n\nAll in all, I would like to recommend these headphones, but the comfort issue is the biggest issue for me. If you can find some (very thick) padding to throw in the headphones, then maybe these will treat you just fine."}
{"review":"Great headphones. I'm not experienced with buying professional pairs of headphones but I was blown away with the quality of these. My only complaints would that I can't wear them for more than an hour at a time without some soreness and that the cord was longer than I expected but that is due to me not reading the details clearly."}
{"review":"Great headphones, very comfortable and excellent sound. I am an audio engineer and find that headphones that are comfortable for long periods of time, are rare ...not sure why. These are very comfortable and have a great sound. The cord and ends are well made so they don't accidentally snap. I've definitely worn more expensive headphones and I would prefer these if they were side by side."}
{"review":"I'm not a hardcore audiophile by any means, but I've used high quality headphones in the past. These are easily the second best pair I've ever used, which is saying something when the best pair cost $500. They didn't sound like much at first - not bad, but not really great either - then one day after a couple of months I was just sitting and listening (instead of my usual working and listening where I'm distracted) and trying to figure out when they started sounding SO GOOD. I take them with me when I go out nearly everyday. They're very sturdy and I can't hear anything but my music when I'm on the bus. I wish they had a shorter cord or came with something to wrap the cord around, but that's a very minor complaint.\n\nTrade in your old graphing calculators you'll never use again to Amazon and get these headphones! I'm very glad I did."}
{"review":"Here is a review I made of these headphoens. The audio is very quiet unfortunately, but I just want to say beforehand, it is a fantastic product.\n\n[...]"}
{"review":"I literally just got these half an hour ago, and I'm already logging on to print a return label.\n\nThey don't sound bad, they sound nice and clear actually. The problem, at least for me, is the low volume level and the significant lack of bass. I tried them on my PC and my Sansa mp3 player, same issues on both devices. I have a set of Turtle Beach x12's and Sony MDR-XB500's, and both of those are plenty loud enough and offer much better bass. The Sony's actually have a little too much bass, obviously, but these M30's have almost none. I don't want huge bass but I want at least some and these just don't offer it.\n\nI realize there is a \"burn in process\" but I can't imagine the volume level or bass would be impacted too much after a burn in, so these are going back."}
{"review":"These replaced my Bose QC 15 headphones when they eventually crapped out. Besides the noise canceling of the QC-15s, I really can't tell the difference.\n\nDurability\/cord: They seem very hardy and well built. Nice long cord with a very well constructed 5 mm plug.\n\nFit: 5\/5 Very comfortable. Had no problems wearing them for hours at a time.\n\nSound quality: 5\/5 I'm not an audiophile, so please take this with a grain of salt, but I honestly could tell no difference in sound quality between these and my Bose QC 15s.\n\nNoise canceling: 3\/5 They do a decent job of muffling background noise, but of course, they do not even slightly compare to the noise-canceling ability of the QC 15s. But unless you spend most of your life in an airplane, the QC 15's noise canceling isn't really worth it.\n\nPrice: 5\/5 They're comparable to a $200 pair of headphones, so yeah, they have some pretty good bang for their buck.\n\nOverall: 5\/5 Fantastic and I wish I had bought them a year ago instead of wasting my money on Bose products.\n\nNOTE: I highly recommend getting a headphone amp with these, such as the FiiO E-6."}
{"review":"Nothing impressive about the sound quality, but I chose this model for the low price and good reviews. The build quality seems to be solid. For playing music from my phone \/ laptop this would be perfect if not for the extremely long cord. For someone mixing and producing music the cord length and durability is great but the sound quality won't be enough for you.\n\nFinally the real reason these headphones were a waste of money for me was the cup size is just too small. Over an hour of use and my ears begin to get sore, at two hours they are on fire and extremely sensitive. I'm 6'5'' so above average height obviously... Going to give these to my girlfriend and see if they work better for her. For you other tall Amazon shoppers though, I would look elsewhere."}
{"review":"Headphones sound great for $50, only wish they didn't feel so plasticy.  I am a videographer who does editing and sound work on my computer.  Because I do primarily shooting, I take my headphones out on the field a lot to monitor audio, and headphones can get knocked around.  I was using Sennheiser HD 280 pros, but the right speaker just cut out after 8 months of use.  These feel much better on the ears, and I like that they don't block out all of the ambient sound, but just enough so you can hear the sound clearly, but hints of ambient in case someone is trying to talk to you on a shoot.  Perfect for my use, we'll see how long they last."}
{"review":"Excellent price and quality. The lows are clear and nice but not overstated. The volume is very high before any degradation in sound quality or balance of tones."}
{"review":"The sound is very detailed, Bass is fine, except for when the music was recorded not that way. I would rather my headphones sound neutral and not add or subtract from the original recording, I can aways add\/or subtract bass\/treble if I choose. I have owned Koss Pro  4 AAA's and AKG 240's and can say I prefer the ATH-M30's"}
{"review":"I bought a pair of these in 2005. I just went back through my emails to check the order confirmation to make sure it was the same model because I was kind of surprised to see them still being sold here nearly a decade later (though over ten dollars cheaper now, or maybe that's just Amazon.)  I originally bought them to practice drumming to music with. They seemed like they'd be hefty enough to drown out my drumming so I could actually hear the music and play along. I was right. They're pretty good at keeping out environmental noises.\n\nAnd I'm no audiophile, but I can't stand terrible headphones or pretty much any earbuds, so I have some standards. These sounded good enough that I felt good listening to music on them aside from my drumming.  I won't go into details on sound quality as others already have, but I'll say that it's good. They sound really good, especially for the price.\n\nWhat I will remark on is their durability. Like I said, I've had these since 2005. A few days ago I left them at work and somebody swiped them so I was browsing amazon to see if I could buy something similar again. Happy to see I can because these things won't die. I've dragged these things all over the country and through all types of weather while walking my dog. I've thrown them in the back of the car and let them fend for themselves there for weeks at a time and they still never failed me. The cord is very, very long (somewhat inconveniently so if you're using them for things like walking the dog - and I realize that is totally not their intended use. But still.) and I was worried it might fail since I had to bunch it up often times. Nope. Never did.\nMy friend bought some expensive bose headphones that sounded slightly better, but they broke after a month and after being replaced by warranty, they broke again. After that he was very, very gentle with them. No need to have such worries with these!\n\nThe only problem was that the thin cover over the foam ear parts wore away and peeled off after a year or two. I feel like that's expected given how hard I was on these, though. And it didn't seem to change the performance at all.\n\nI probably look kind of dorky always wandering around with these huge studio-ish-looking headphones all the time, but it's a small price to pay for comfort and good sound quality.\n\nI'm probably going to buy another set."}
{"review":"This was exactly I was looking for. It is very clear and I can still hear some one in the room if I want to."}
{"review":"We have Bose Noise Cancelling headphones which we love, but I have four pairs of these.  One sits at our piano and the other at our computer, and the other two are for video games.  They are comfortable, durable,  and work well as an everyday alternative that I don't worry about the kids messing up.\n\nWith a piano you will need a converter (A little bigger plug)"}
{"review":"Great headphones reasonably priced. They do the job I'm using them for, which is to mix and monitor recordings from our band rehearsals. A lot of crisp detail, especially when I compare them to the cheapo headphones I was using before."}
{"review":"While these headphones have excellent sound quality for under 50$, I find them incredibly uncomfortable to wear. The padding does not sufficiently lift the headphones away from my head, causing my ears to be smooshed by the hard plastic where the sound is produced from. Wearing these for more than 30 minutes makes my ears very red and tender. For those looking for both audio quality AND comfort, I would recommend another pair. However, if you're only using this for short periods of time, I couldn't recommend these enough."}
{"review":"Wonderful sound, very crisp and clear. I just wish the cord weren't quite so long, but I'm a home consumer user, and I imagine the length is meant for studio work. There's a metal spring\/coil near the jack, which is nice, since that'll help avoid fraying. I'm surprised that the price was so low when I bought thesethey're certainly worth it."}
{"review":"The price to quality ratio is quite favorable indeed.  I've even dropped them pretty hard a few times and they still are going strong.  Durability is always a plus for me."}
{"review":"Bulky and a little tight but great sound. I am no expert like some of these other reviewers. I'm just an average guy trying to listed to music and play my guitar without disturbing the entire neighborhood. I find the sounds crisp and clear for the money. I am sure I could have spent much more for a modest improvement in sound. These don't claim to be noise canceling so I don't know why others are commenting on that. Wire is very long which allows me to move around with my guitar and it comes with a 1\/8-1\/4 adapter that screws together so I can plug it into my amp and will not come undone."}
{"review":"These headphones are awesome. Can't imagine any better and the price (under $50) is even more awesome. I may never buy another brand of headphones again. Well done Audio-Technica"}
{"review":"They work fine and I have beat them to crap in my office over the years and they still work great. I am very hard on this stuff and there all sorts of little nibbles taken out of the soft parts. Not sure if that is really a genuine concern given my treatment of them."}
{"review":"These quit working in less than 3 months of use!! EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!! They are just junk now collecting dust in my home. I will never buy another Audio-Technica product again!"}
{"review":"Great headphones at this price point. Decent sound reproduction, sonic accuracy. Have listened to more expensive headphones and cannot justify the price for my casual use. Cord long enough for most applications, use an extension cord if more is needed. Fit is comfortable but can get a little warm on the ears. I like that the included 1\/4 inch adapter screws on so it stays put."}
{"review":"I'm no professional in the audio field, but I love these! Ordered this with the Beyerdynamic DT 235 and prefer these. Sound is great, clear, and loud and the closed back means you hear almost all your music instead of other people when you have them on. Will definitely look into getting the ATH-M50 when I have spare cash to spend."}
{"review":"I've had these Headphones for over 8 months now.\n\nI bought these primarily to plug into a guitar amp (which the 1\/4\" srew-on adapter is included to do so)\n\nWOW! The sound is amazing! Even at levels very LOUD these things to not disappoint!\n\nI was tempted to buy more expensive headphones but I'm very content with these, the sound, the fit, and the durability  (although I WILL say that the plastic \"Y\" shaped part, the part that has the \"L\" and \"R\", has always worried me that if I dropped them that it could break at that point, but that hasn't happened)\n\nThe cord is durable (I've accidentally  ran it over with my office chair more than once!) and has held up great."}
{"review":"Picked it up while on sale, comfortable light weight good sounding headphones. Sure they don't sound as good as a 400 dollar pair of denons but they come with a 1\/4 inch adapter and have a long cord"}
{"review":"Incredible sound quality. I forgot just how good speakers can be. And I finally have real base again. I can't believe how durable and hefty the audio cord is. You can't replace the cord, but its very thick and durable. A spring covers the plug end to help prevent the likelihood of you damaging it."}
{"review":"The headphones themselves provide excellent quality audio.. A rich, deep bass that doesn't overdo it by washing out the mids and highs. Really a very nice pair of headphones for the price they're offered at.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a downside. They don't hold up very comfortably to extended use at one time.. After about two or three hours my ears begin to feel uncomfortable and smushed by the enclosure, and I have to take the headphones out to stretch my ears, rub and flex them, etc...\n\nOverall, a good purchase for your money, but if you're an avid audiophile who is prone to having headphones in for more than a couple of hours a day, I'd suggest going up to M50s, or at least doing a little more research first."}
{"review":"Works great.  Fantastic sound quality.  The extra long cord lets me roll around my office without pulling the headset off by mistake.  Do have to be careful about running over the cord."}
{"review":"The sound quality is decent, but I got these because I wanted a pair of noise cancelling headphones that would help block out sounds while I'm trying to study. While these dull sounds, they do not cancel sound at all. It's possible to crank music up in order to drown out sounds -- but I could do that with any pair of headphones or earbuds. The point of buying noise cancelling headphones was that I wanted to cancel out noise without having to blow out my eardrums in an attempt to keep from having to listen to the sounds of people's conversations in the library."}
{"review":"These are wonderful headphones for $50. The sound is very good, though hardcore audiophiles will probably want something more advanced. The noise isolation is good considering they are not noise-isolation headphones. With music on I can barely hear the TV on in the same room. Best of all these babies are COMFORTABLE!"}
{"review":"It's hard to buy headphones without trying them on, but these ended up being a perfect fit after a few minor adjustments.  The cord is very sturdy.  Unlike other headphones I've had, these are so comfortable I can wear them for hours at work.  The sound is great."}
{"review":"You should take in consideration that is has a really long (3m) cable. If you want to use them outside, you must take care of this"}
{"review":"The cord is too long but the sound is great. I have had them for 2 years and the sound is still amazing they are better than beats."}
{"review":"At the under $50 price point this is a nice pair of headphones.\n\nThe Good\nI bought these headphones to plug into my vintage stereos.\n\n-The headphones come with a 1\/4\" to 3.5mm adapter which save me having to buy a $5 adapter.\n-As far as sound quality, these headphones are excellent and warrant 4 stars.\n-I found the headphones comfortable to wear for listening to a few hours of music. Are they comfortable for longer than that? I do not know.\n-Other reviewers said the volume was too low. On my iPod Touch the sound is fine at 50% volume. If you are looking at cranking up your music very, very loud you will not like these... I cannot speak for how these headphones work with other portable MP3 players. Bottom line, these headphones are not powered so they are only as good as the device driving them.\n- Headphones have a long 12' cord (but it is fixed!!!)\n\nThe Not So Good\nI only rate these headphones 2-1\/2 stars for everything other than sound quality. Here is what I do not like.\n- Headphone cups stay in a fixed position, as such they are not portable like my older Audio Technica noise canceling headphones.\n- Headphone cord is 12' and fixed. If you snag the cord you can send these to the landfill. If you want a shorter cord tough luck.\n\nFor my limited use at home these headphones are nice, though I do not think these are going to last very long based upon the fixed cord that does not seem to be repairable should it break. Had I seen these headphones in a store where I could inspect them before buying I still would have loved the sound and price but passed on buying them based upon my durability concerns.\n\n---\n\nAdded 1\/28\/2014\nI was a little harsh in my last paragraph. I now carry these speakers in a small bag to work along with my Little Dot I+ headphone amp, and my HRT Music Streamer II DAC. I have been doing this for the past three weeks and they are holding up well. The sound is really good and I wear these cans sometimes for 2-3 hours at a time and they are very comfortable. I actually would buy them again. I have upgraded to 4 stars."}
{"review":"The sound quality is superb. They are the best bang for the buck for an affordable set of headphones. Pretty good noise cancellation and excellent surround sound. They do kind of get a bit uncomfortable after a while would be my only drawback in addition to the long cord."}
{"review":"Was a gift for my BF.  He LOVES them. He is really hard on headphones and earbuds, and goes through them in a month. This pair has survived almost a year and are still going strong."}
{"review":"Great headphones for the price. Nice clear, crisp sound. I use the in my guitar amp and I am very pleased. Comfortable and easy to use. Comes with an adapter for the larger plug holes like my amp."}
{"review":"I'm not an audiophile and I don't care for amazing sound but this has been a solid pair of headphones. Awesome headphones for its price.\n\nAlthough I thought the cushion parts of the headphones were going to be bigger, it's still a great buy. I'm completely happy with it."}
{"review":"Good - but wish there was a connector to the headphones.  I just know in the future that's going to be the weak point where it breaks!"}
{"review":"These headphones were too big for my head, I have to  tilt them at an odd angle to sit them on my head.  They also pinch my ears after wearing them for more than 2 hours.  That being said, I use them for doing QA in medical transcription, and the sound is superior (at least for the spoken word with background noise) to help me fill in the blanks!  Still on the hunt for the perfect pair.  All things being equal, I prefer earbuds also.  These get too hot for me even in 65-degree weather-although that is not the earphones fault!  I forgot to mention the sound volume is very low, I can turn my computer to the max, plus the software to the max and still have them on my head."}
{"review":"I do a lot of home recording, and reading reviews by others told me to expect very good audio quality from these headphones without having to spend hundreds of dollars.  They perform exactly as I'd hoped, and this retiree did not have to spend a lot of money to get there.\n\nThanks, Audio Technica, and all reviewers...."}
{"review":"Nice headset. Works well, fits well, no problem at all. Good much of price and quality. Was a gift to my husband, he likes it."}
{"review":"The quaility is good, but the volume is not loud enough when compared with headphones of the the same price range. Even when compared to cheaper headphones this headphone's volume just isn't loud enough."}
{"review":"I've owned these headphones for about a year now and nothing has broken on them (they've been handled pretty roughly). I constantly roll over the cord with my chair and there are no grooves, kinks, or slices in the cable! I'm rating 4 stars only for the fact that after about 2 hours they get uncomfortable on my ears (I've experienced this with all the headphones I've owned, but these are't as bad as some other ones).\n\nI constantly recommend this product to friends."}
{"review":"They're not noise-cancelling when no sound is playing, but seems like it is when I press play. Very impressed with the quality\/cost ratio, definitely pleased with my purchase."}
{"review":"With so much variety available on the market nowadays for headphones it can sometimes be hard to find a nice pair for a decent price. When looking for a product that fits your specific needs it's always good to do your research before making a final decision. I wanted some headphones to use for my home recording studio to help me monitor tracks and I also wanted something to use for regular music listening. I don't consider myself an audiophile but I would like to think I know the difference between what sounds good and what doesn't. Even though I enjoy high quality products I'm not too harsh about certain things, if the price is good and the product quality is decent then I'm more than happy to make the purchase. I usually like to shop for my stuff on Amazon.com when you search for headphones on their search engine you will see a variety of options and choices. Depending on your budget you can find listed headphones ranging from $12.00 to a ridiculous amount of $2,000.00. I see a lot of people buying the Dre beats and those other high end headphones but I honestly would never spend that type of money on a pair of headphones. Not only that but sometimes people are only paying for the name brand and not so much for an overall good product. There are a lot of different alternatives for someone looking to buy a decent pair of headphones. I researched for a pair of headphones keeping in mind what I specifically needed them for. I also decided that I wasn't going to spend a lot of money for a pair of headphones that were going to serve me for basic purposes. For about $40.00 I got my self the Audio-Technica ATH-M30 Professional Headphones. These line of Audio Technica headphones come in different model numbers and depending on how much you are looking to spend you can keep going up in models until you find something that suits you. At first I wanted to buy the lower end model which was the ATH-M20 which cost about $10.00 less but I didn't want to be \"cheap\" so I chose to go with the higher model the ATH-M30. After receiving these headphones I kept wondering if it was worth paying the ten extra bucks for the higher model and I can honestly say I still have mixed feelings about it. When it comes to comfort these headphones are very light despite its \"professional\" look and they also come with nice padding providing your ears with soft cushions. I can use these for long periods of time with out feeling like my ears are being pinched or like they are having pressure being put on them. I have a pretty big head and these headphones do not give my ears any sort of real discomfort a side from the normal warm feeling you get from using headphones. These headphones are adjustable so you can always move them up and down to fit the size of your head. Compared to some of my previous headphones I can say that the Audio Technica ATH-M30 are more well built and seem very sturdy I think they could survive a few accidental mishaps. With the cable being 11 ft. long these are ideal for somebody looking to have space to move around while using them. I personally don't have a need for the long cable but it's nice to have the option to have more distance if needed. I also got these headphones because of its nice black and sleek look, I wanted something that would match my existing setup. Those are the physical aspects that I really enjoyed about these headphones but now let's get to the most important subject at hand. You might be asking yourself what is the sound quality on these headphones, well to be quite honest the sound that these headphones produce is satisfactory. When turned up they will sound very nice and crisp, I have ringing in my ears resulting from hearing loss so I usually use them at low volume but they still sound good. Some reviews will state that these headphones sound amazingly good and I didn't find that to be exactly true. They sound good but not better than any other decent pair of headphones that you can find online. For those of you who enjoy the extra big booming bass sound from a pair of cans I would not recommend these for you. If you like a more warm and subtle sounding bass than the ATH-M30's will fit your preference. The high and lows on the Audio Technica ATH-M30 sound very clear and accurate like I stated before I'm not an audio expert but I personally feel that they sound good. I listen to all types of music so I have tested these headphones out with pretty much every genre of music and they all sound good. I mostly listen to rock and rap so there isn't much diversity in the songs when I have my music player on shuffle but once in a while a techno or drum & bass song will sneak in there and it will remind me of how nice these pair of headphones sound. Some people have stated in some reviews that they started hearing instruments and sounds that they had never heard before in some songs after using these headphones but I can personally say that I haven't so I find that to be not true. These headphones are labeled as \"professional\" headphones and I find that title to be a bit misleading. I would say these headphones are a step up for someone who has never owned a proper set of headphones but I wouldn't classify these as professional. The Audio Technica ATH-M30 headphones do exactly what I wanted them to do which were to help me monitor my tracks when recording and to provide acceptable quality when listening to music. If I had to describe these headphones in one word it would be \"decent\" because they do deliver as headphones but just fall a bit short due to not providing superior sound quality. I will admit that I expected more out of these headphones especially since they were labeled as \"professional\" headphones. If I would have paid more than the original marked price then maybe I would have felt a bit cheated out but overall I'm very satisfied with this product. I would recommend shopping around first and researching before buying because you might get them cheaper some where else. Even though $40.00 might not sound like much to some it might be a lot to others so that's why I advice to shop around because you might find a different pair of headphones that measure up to these for a lower price. I walk away from this purchase feeling a bit discontent but not discouraged the Audio Technica ATH-M30 headphones look good, sound decent and are sold a fair price."}
{"review":"they don't block out sound basically- they're just for listening for music so if you're looking just for listening headphones then these are fine, but if you want sound blocked out too, maybe not."}
{"review":"Before I bought 2 pair of these, one for my husband and one for me I compared prices and quality.  This indeed was the best buy and we are not disappointed.\nThe only thing, and I don't know if it the headphones or my Kindle but the plug is loose won't work.  I  have my regular headphones that work just fine.  Works on my computer just fine."}
{"review":"Using these for the first time, and I am thoroughly enjoying them. A full, rich sound, without over bearing bass (like those awful Beats headphones)\n\nThe only thing that is keeping me from giving them the full 5 stars is that the cord is super long. Too long. But don't let that stop you, for $55 shipped these are the way to go. Don't hesitate.\n\nCheers."}
{"review":"the design and comfort are normal, but the cable is just too long! I can't believe they made a huge chord which tanlges up all the time"}
{"review":"Arrived earlier than scheduled. Comfortable on my ears. The headband is nicely padded and comfortable on my head. I can wear them for hours without any discomfort. Nice sound for the price. It has a thick single sided cord which is reinforced at the connection points. They seem to be well made. Comes with a 1\/4 adapter that screws on. A nice feature. I purchased the Slappa Pro full size hardbody headphone case to keep them in.  I recommend them and would buy them again."}
{"review":"I'll keep it short. These are some of the best sounding headphones I've heard for under $100. I've been using them for over 6 months now and they show no signs of wearing down. They're comfortable even with glasses on and they sound great while blocking a significant amount of background noise.\n\nThey have a sturdy connection with a spring around it to help protect the cable. It's worth noting that the cable is not removable, which is unfortunate if it breaks. However, it's a high quality cable and shows no signs of wearing down anytime soon.\n\nI would recommend them to anyone looking for reasonably priced quality headphones."}
{"review":"I needed something inexpensive to do some basic mixing and reduce background noise in a closed room - this is adequate for my purposes but would definitely upgrade for critical listening.  The sound is heavier on the low end as compared with the Sony headphones I used previously."}
{"review":"Before you read my review, my ears are not used to the very high quality sound. I used to wear old cheaper kind you can find at places such as Walmart. So of course my ears are going to have low standards of what good headphones sound like.\n\nThese sound really nice. Obviously they are not the best headphones you can get out there, but for their price I think they work great.\n\nThey fit nicely over my ears. I can wear them for as long as I'd like and not have sore ears (which is one of the reasons I bought these).\n\nThe cable can be shortened a bit. It's just to long for me. It's nice, I can get up and grab something within my room without taking them off (my room is not gigantic, but it isn't a small either), but it's a pain because it wraps around my chair a lot.\n\nThese headphones are recommended to anyone who wants a decent good-sounding pair of headphones without going incredibly expensive. With Amazon Prime, these are only $60, a nice price."}
{"review":"The headphones are great. The cord is only on the left hand side, so it doesn't get in the way when you are doing stuff. Super long cord if you need to move around. I would recommend."}
{"review":"Fantastic headphones for the price. A step below in performance from the ATH-M50s, but these can't be beat in this price range. Definitely recommend for use at work to help block out office noise while providing awesome sound."}
{"review":"I've had these for 15 minutes and already like them so much better than my $99 Grado SR80s (which I got sick of gluing back together) that I was moved to write this review. They sound about as good as the former, a bit warmer perhaps, and are very comfortable, unlike the former. For the money (I paid $45), these are insanely good; I plan on getting a second pair for the office."}
{"review":"These headphones are heavy and tiring to wear for extended times. Also the sonic quality is just lacking. They are dull. When checking a mix out I put these on, and certain frequencies are just not there. I'll keep these for an emergency backup, but they won't be my go to headphone.\n\nHowever the price of these headphones meet the quality and why I give it 3 stars. They are OK."}
{"review":"I ordered these headphones to improve the sound quality on my KindlefFire, which was kind of low and not stereo. Now the sound is better when i watch movies, and can hear what the actors \"mumble\".  :)"}
{"review":"I bought these to use at my job, in the office when I cut soundtracks for fireworks shows. I needed something that would be somewhat noise canceling as we don't have a dedicated studio, but I also needed to be able to hear if someone called for me. In that way, they cancel just the right amount of background noise out. The sound quality is good, albeit a little too much bass for my taste; it isn't that there is too little mid- and high- range, those are definitely present, the bass is just a little too thumping. I also have to expect my work to be played back on sound systems at stadiums which tend not to have a lot of bass sometimes, so it isn't necessarily a true representation for me. However, if you are buying them just to listen to your iPod through a good set of headphones, these are perfect. They are very comfortable up to a few hours, and after that, I think just about any headphones would be annoying."}
{"review":"These headphones are not quite as \"loud\" as others I've used, but they're very comfortable and have pretty good sound quality.  For the price you really can't beat it.  I can wear these on a 2 hour plane ride and they feel great."}
{"review":"Nice quality, very long cord, and nicely built jack. They block out external noise nicely and sound very good. My ears get a little irritated by being squished down for a long period of time, but that's not really this model of headphone's fault. Maybe some other headphones have bigger cavities for ears, but it's not really a big deal. Good value for the price. Gave me what i wanted."}
{"review":"I get to hear my tunes without bothering others in the house.  They work great , the sound is smooth.  I would purchase again and recommend to others."}
{"review":"Comfort is really important to me. I might have these on for several hours at a time working in my studio.\n\nThese are very comfortable. Light weight, soft ear foam, and a spring band pressure that doesn't make your eyes pop out. Sound I believe is more than I expected as well. Very satisfied.\n\nThey would be a 5 except I suspect the durability may prove less than ideal. At this price, if they last a couple of years I would be very happy.\n\nLong cord is a plus as well."}
{"review":"These work\/sound good, but if I end up wearing them for several hours my ears tend to get red and uncomfortable.  No fun.  Maybe I have big ears."}
{"review":"The sound quality is great, the long cord convenient and so far they have held up well to use that isn't always gentle. A bit more padding would be an improvement."}
{"review":"I use these in a home studio.  Very good sound clarity and decent isolation from room sound. I find the extra long chord a nice feature when moving around the room with a guitar, etc."}
{"review":"for $50 these are very good headphones. I haven't tried mastering just yet with these however I noticed a considerable difference between these headphones and others in terms of audio quality."}
{"review":"It's been working fine for weeks. Sturdy cord, a little long but manageable. I'd recommend these to anybody looking for something to block out noise."}
{"review":"These heaphones are light weight and almost perfectly comfortable.  Unfortunately the hole for the ears to fit in is just a bit too small and after about an hour of use...causes pain. Additionally unfortunate is that they don't block any ambient room noise.  Can still here the wall clock ticking and believe it or not...will AMPLIFY noises that I can't even notice with them off. For example...I can hear a far off train appoaching with them on ..but not with them on.  And the neigbor's central air can be heard much louder with them on than off.  They work, for me, somewhat as a sea shell does when put up to the ear.\n  Movies sound great...just enough bass and crystal clear.  I did, however return them due to the minimal noise reduction.  Bought some new Extreme Isolation ex-29 headphones and they're perfect.  Including enough room for my average sized ears."}
{"review":"Great quality. Bought after a lot of research and definitely made the right decision. I'm really happy with them. Better known brands aren't necessarily better performing is what I've learned."}
{"review":"They are very comfortable, the sound is very clear and the tone is very deep & rich. They fit really good on my head and I don't feel like it is compressing my head. I also like the connection part, there is a wire loom around the cable so it won't pinch or fold up."}
{"review":"I use them for my job and they are much better than the cheap set that I had.  Am able to hear better what is said through them.  Very good sound quality."}
{"review":"rated these a 4 cuz they could be a little louder.. however, they have great sound separation. which, with studio monitors that's the more important aspect to me.. some have said they are uncomfortable, but to me even after a couple hrs they are not too noticeable..\n\nIn the end, if your creating music and are on a budget, these are the cans for you! if you have an extra $20 the sony mdr-v55's are a nice notch above these, but these are still great for $50.."}
{"review":"Precise sound.\nBass response is a little low, but mid's and highs are definitely better than what i was used too.\nOnly problem is that the noise cancellation isn't the best."}
{"review":"I bought these because they had great reviews and I live in a basement above which thepeople have no consideration. I work nights and sleep days, and I desperately need something to block out the sound so I can stay asleep. These did not work for this purpose. That is the sole criteria on which I am rating them. I did not test for aound quality, only noise blockage. I am sure they are otherwise great headphones, but they did not work for my purpose."}
{"review":"Worked well before the jack broke on it. Cord is too long and is a tripping hazard.\n\nIf u are looking for dj headphones they are for you. Otherwise I do Not reconmend  this product"}
{"review":"While I will admit that I am not a true audiophile, these headphone are much more comfortable, and with great sounds, than my old JVC's."}
{"review":"Just got mine in the mail today. These headphones are SO SO SO SO SO comfortable. This is such an improvement over my last pair of Sony headphones (they were comparable in price but not in quality!).\n\nThey also seem high quality. I made a good decision to purchase these. Love when that happens. Yay!"}
{"review":"I'm a fan of many types of music and these headphones certainly demonstrate their capabilities better in certain genres than others. If all you listen to is pop rock and country, you can probably take a pass on these. The difference is fairly minimal in these genres and, while it sounds \"better\" it won't change your life. That said, while listening to hardcore, metal, and electronic genres I've stopped myself on multiple occasions and just said \"wow.\" The bass is so heavy, high notes sound so good... the sound quality of these headphones simply cannot be beaten at this price."}
{"review":"These headphones are great. I bought them for my dad for his birthday, as his cheap but good Koss on-ear headphones were broken. He plays in a rock band, and they record albums, so he used these cans to listen to the various versions of produced tracks that they recorded. He loves them. For the price that I got them for, about 50 bucks, they're insane. A guy I know has the&nbsp;, and I honestly can't tell much difference between them (although I've only used the M50s a few times, and by listening to them side by side, I could probably tell some differences). If you're hesitating to buy them, just do it. You'll absolutely love them, as my dad and I surely have for the few months he's had them."}
{"review":"For the money, it is hard to beat. I have used for hours after hours after hours. No issues with comfort, little warm for my liking, but here in Sydney it gets quite warm in the summer. The head band is made of metal covered by fabric, so when it arrived it was a little too tight for me, pulled it till it was bent permanently to fit a little bit more loosely, and its been symphony since.\nBelow is a review with closeups of the earcups.\n[...]"}
{"review":"Sounds good, comfortable and you can't beat the price.  These headphones are not advertised as noise cancelling, but does an ok job of blocking out sound."}
{"review":"I've had these headphones for a year and can tell you they are some great headphones. They cost ~$45 when I got them, now they cost $58 at the time of this writing. I also have the cheaper Panasonic RP-HTX7's which I will use as a comparison. I got those for slightly under $30 on Amazon.\n\nI recommend these headphones for someone who will be using these at home for their computer, electronic musical instruments, or studio recording. These are not good for plugging into iPods\/iPhones\/mobile devices because they\n1. have an 11 foot (~3 meter) cord\n2. don't block outside sound very well\n3. are not exactly a fashion statement.\n\nTHE GOOD -\n\nSound. I use these headphones plugged into my computer and electronic drum set. They sound great for music, gaming, drumming, and everything else. These are the kind of headphones that will have you noticing all the little details in your music, especially if plugged into a good quality source. The bass is great, Unlike the Panasonics' bass. It's tight and controlled with some good impact and presence especially when EQ'ed. The same could not be said about the Panasonics. They have really weak bass response to begin with, and it sounds very muddy and crappy when turned up. These headphones also have a nice wide sound stage (Where is seems the sound is coming from). Wider is better, you don't want the sound to seem likes it's happening 'inside your head.'\n\nConstruction. These are sturdy headphones. After a year of abuse (including being dropped and stepped on), these have not had a single problem. The cable is nice and thick, the plastic is tough, and the headband is made of metal on the inside. You can expect this good build quality on all Audio Technica products. They Panasonics, on the other hand, are pretty flaky. The driver on the inside the the 'phones came loose and I had to take it apart and glue it back.\n\nThey come with a 1\/8 to 1\/4 inch jack adapter. Handy.\n\nTHE BAD - (noticeably shorter!)\n\nSound Isolation. They don't block out external noises or keep your music in very well. When I took these on a road trip (bad idea), everyone in the car could here my music. The Panasonic headphones isolate much better than these.\n\nComfort. These headphones leave my ears hurting after an hour of use. They press down on my ears because the earpads are not thick enough. I've tried getting 3rd party pads (Auray Deluxe Velour Earpads), and they helped a little but didn't really cut it so I sent them back. The Panasonics also take the lead here, I can wear those for hours without feeling anything.\n\nOne thing to note, they have a pretty flat frequency response (how much low range, mid range, and high range there is. Flat means they are all balanced, which is a little more of a boring sound. With bass and treble turned up, it makes the sound seem more 'alive'). So if your device doesn't have a good EQ, like iOS devices, you might want to consider something else.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make in this review is that these headphones are not for you if you are going to be moving around or travelling. If you are, you should get some portable headphones. These headphones are intended for people who are going to be sitting\/standing still, and are great for those applications.\n\nLast paragraph--time for me to completely contradict myself (sort of). The price has risen about 15 dollars since I got them a year ago, so at this pricepoint you might want to look into something else if it aligns to your needs better. However, they're still great headphones even if not as good a value as one year ago.\n\nHope this helps!"}
{"review":"Just to be clear, I've never owned a professional pair of headphones before. I've used them in the past, but in very loud noise environments as a sound engineer.\n\nThese headphones are fantastic, especially for the $60 pricetag I got them for. Their acoustic balance is slightly more bass-heavy than I'm used to, and that's definitely a plus. No tinny sound whatsoever. Listening to various music (daft punk, folk music) I have to say that this is a great pair of headphones for any genre.\n\nHeadphones are very comfortable on the head, fully cup around the ears, but my ears don't touch the drivers. Although, this makes them a bit hot on the ears, since they're not open-backed headphones. The cable is very long, even if I have to reach and grab something partly across the room. They arrived in great condition, no inner packaging damage at all.\n\nIf you're not an extreme audiophile and are on a budget, I'd recommend getting these if you ever listen with headphones."}
{"review":"Paid: ~40$\n\nI primarily use these headphones at work.  The sound is crisp, full and clear.  After buying the first pair I bought two more (one for my wife and one for my home office)."}
{"review":"I was reticent to spend so much on headphones for the office. But my office can be rather busy, chaotic, and I wanted to be able to close out the noise.\n\nIt does a great job of closing out the noise without the battery hassles of active noise cancellation headphones. So on that front: winning.\n\nBut more importantly they sound fantastic. So much better than what you'd get for a little less money. It's worth the investment. I'm not an audiophile, I'm not going to nerd you out with specs & buzzwords. There are other reviewers here who can do that. :)"}
{"review":"They have a great sound for a resonable price.  My son is 13 and does not need $200.00 headphones.\nAs usuall they arrived early.  Love that!"}
{"review":"I bought these for a birthday gift and apparently they are a very good brand. He seems to really like the headphones and uses them a lot."}
{"review":"High quality for a very good price. I use them for an electronic drum machine at home. Fit is great. Cord length is adequate. Recommended."}
{"review":"Due to hearing issues, I use headphones quite frequently when watching television.  I've had other brands, but issues arose due to their design.  These are very well made, and the end of the cord with the jack has a spring wrapped around it, making it more durable for the bending necessary at that end."}
{"review":"Love the sound quality, comparable or superior to many more expensive brands\/models. Also very durable, I ran over the (very long) cord a couple of times in my office chair, and despite some cosmetic scratches on the cable, they still work perfectly."}
{"review":"I just got these headphones in the mail a few hours ago but I can tell you you right now that these are amazing!! Plugged these into my computer threw on some music and my jaw was on the floor! The sound quality is incredible. Crystal clear! On top of that they are super comfortable! I could wear these for hours unlike some other headphones that I've owned. Other headphones start to hurt my ears after about a half an hour, but these are like having your head lightly sandwiched between to fluffy pillows! I would recommend these to anyone! Only con is that the cable is super long. However, I easily remedied that by coiling up part of the cable until it was a suitable length and then zip-tying the coil in place.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAfter 3 months of daily use, these headphones are still like the first day I received them (the first part of my review)! FLAWLESS!! They sound the same. They're still as comfortable as ever. I use them for hours pretty much everyday! They are definitely the most durable and best sounding headphones I have owned to date! Still five stars!!!!!"}
{"review":"1)cheap and great frickin quality.\n\n2.a)blocks out sound of other people, which is awesome in noisy cubical.\n\n2.b)also, other people can't hear what 'I' am listing too.\n\n3) Super comfortable but this likely leads to the ear pads falling apart later... we will see."}
{"review":"I read a lot of the reviews for this product before I bought these, and I have to agree with every positive review. The headphones are comfortable. I can wear them all day without my ears getting too hot. The sound is terrific - very rich in all the ranges I can hear. These are probably my favorite headphones I've ever owned."}
{"review":"As a broadcast professional, I was a bit skeptical of the reviews for the ATH M30's.  Under $60 for \"professional studio monitor\" headphones is a bit hard to believe.  I do know.  The sturdy construction was the main reason I went ahead with the purchase and that part of the review was obvious from the moment I busted open the package.  The heavy cord, stout head strap were obvious as well as no apparently weak points which are too often a feature of headphones in my experience.  That was nice, but then when I put them on, I was shocked. The depth, separation, clarity..all outstanding.  And I could still hear myself talk when using them with a mic, which can be a problem with some audiophile-type equipment.  And, like many of the audiophile types who have reviewed previously, they just continued sounding better since, as I've probably given them close to a hundred hours.  Van Morrison's Moondance never sounded better.  Only quibble is that on some recordings that weren't as clean, the ATH-M30s make it way too obvious.  My downloaded  Miles Davis set has an annoying hiss that I'm pretty sure wasn't in the original.  Never noticed it playing through the crummy little speakers in my Kindle Fire (not HD.)  Wholehearted endorsement.\n\nUpdate:  a few months on, love them even more.  Tough as a boot.  Have been subjected horrendous feedback, loud play, rough treatment and still booming, even improving in sound response.  Hearing stuff on old fav's I never picked up on..caracas that are almost too loud on a couple of Rod Stewart cuts from the 70s, e.g....thinking of getting a second pair for home."}
{"review":"Wow, these are the most comfortable over-the-ear headphones I've ever worn.  Have these plugged into a mixer board to monitor recording of both music and spoken word.  Audio performance is just as good, or better, than the AKG K240s they replaced.  Based on comfort, performance and cost I think these are the best headphone deal going.  Last, but certainly not least, the packaging is brilliant.  Flip open 3 tabs and the package easily separates - NO welded plastic clamshell that you have to cut apart."}
{"review":"For those of you who feel uneasy about investing in high-quality headphones, these headphones are a worthwhile spend for the uninitiated; they are built solid, have decent sound, and feel great (once you wear them for a while)."}
{"review":"really good product that i got on sale. it was great. i love these head phones. i put them in my backpack when i go to school and when i forget i have them in there and just throw my backpack around these have not broke yet. they are great. a really long wire, i mean really long. Yes these are suppose to be used for a studio but they are great for school to. love them."}
{"review":"Great headphones for the price. They work very well for me in my project studio. If you need good quality flat response headphones for recording I recommend these."}
{"review":"These headphones are extremely comfortable and the sound is superb for the price. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a solid pair of headphones."}
{"review":"Pros:  The sound is great, and they are very comfortable, even after several hours of continuous use.  They are sturdy, but light, and the fit is adjustable.  My only concern is that the fabric covering the foam feels very thin, and I worry about how well it will hold up over time.\nCons:  The cord is not detachable, and is very long, which is great if you need a long cord for studio use, but cumbersome for personal use.  This is easy enough to solve by cutting the cord short and attaching a new end, but a detachable cord would be nicer."}
{"review":"No complaints for this bargain buy in the \"Headphones\" section.\n\nThey want me to write more, but there is no need.\n\nThese headphones at this price will satisfy most any entry-level customer.\n\nIf not \"Entry-level\" get the ATH-M50 s and pay $100.00 more.\n\nYour choice..."}
{"review":"The sound that comes from these headphones was very satisfying for me. I'm not a self-proclaimed audiophile, but I do have a bachelor's in music performance, so I'm rather critical when listening to classical recordings. Listening to symphonies with this for the first time was like finally getting the right eyeglass prescription, as I suddenly heard finer nuance than before.\n\nMy only complaint is that the housing for the ears is a little too small for me, and my ears will get uncomfortable if I wear for extended periods of time. Overall, very happy with the purchase."}
{"review":"Just like the title says, I love how these headphones sound but prolonged wear really hurts my ears.  They just aren't quite big enough to fit over all of them.  Now, my ears might be slightly larger than average but keep that in mind when deciding to purchase."}
{"review":"I really don't have any experience with sound quality. The only head phones I've ever really had was the basic Apple ear buds. As far as sound, I guess it sounds nice. I can hear a lot of sounds I could not hear which ear buds. As for the bass, You'll obviously hear it, it just won't make your head vibrate (if you like that kind of stuff) but definitely, you will hear things you would not have picked up from Apple ear buds.\n\nBought this at $35 during a sale which is what motivated me to buy this including the thousands of reviews that recommended this product.\n\nAnyways, I felt the need to express my feelings that this headphone is really worth it. For what I bought it for, I have no regrets of ever owning it...\n\nExtremely comfortable, the padding on top and around the ears are very light and can be worn for many many hours (provided that it's not pinching your ears). I spend a lot of time playing games or designing things on AutoCAD for many hours and I'll sometimes forget I'm wearing it. Well, not really forget but you get the point.\n\nOnly thing that becomes cumbersome is the length of the cord which is unnecessarily too long enough to the point where you can't really walk around school while wearing this without the wires tucked into a backpack or a pocket. Another problem is the wires are exposed. You can see one of the wires on the picture. It's not really a problem, I'm just afraid that it will accidently be pulled on which will break the headphone."}
{"review":"I love this stereo headphones. The sound quality is great. The cushioned (earbands) are soft and they fit over my ears just right. They don't hurt my ears even after I wear them for over an hour because they are lightweight and comfortable. The other thing that I really like is the long wire cable. It's just really convenient when I have to get up away from my desk."}
{"review":"I bought a pair of these well over 5 years ago and they have held up almost perfectly. The only wear over the years is the faux leather like covering over the padding around they ear has frayed and worn away, but the padding itself is still completely intact. Aside from running over them with a car, they will hold up to every day use and a few dings and scratches. The audio quality is amazing and better than most other well known brands and for a fraction of the cost, and I am not alone in this opinion. The low bass range is always audible and you can even feel some rumble, the mid and high ranges are clear and wide. The 1\/4 inch adapter that is included was my original reason for purchasing, and it is a great adapter that screws on so it is always secure. The cord is super long, over 6 feet, which can be cumbersome, but also can come in handy. I have used these headphone from everything to monitoring and mixing studio recordings, field recordings, location sound for films, and of course just listening to music. After buying these years ago and being blown away I decided to check out other Audio Technica products and they are all equal on quality and affordability. I recommend these headphones and the brand itself."}
{"review":"I had bought these for their noise canceling capabilities, but they lacked that ability. I could still hear everything just as clearly as my other headphones. Returned."}
{"review":"For $50 these are some of the best headphones I've used. Good response across the spectrum and vocals are very clear. One nice thing I noticed is that the sound quality does not change (i.e. more bass, etc.) when you press the headphones against your ears the way it does with certain other models."}
{"review":"Use the product for studio work and editing. Comfortable.  Good sound reproduction.  Cord is long, which can be awkward, but manageable if shortened as a loop."}
{"review":"These are great headphones. I like the construction. Very sturdy, and the chord is very long. The Input jack is very well constructed and very heavy duty. The head phones are very light compared to my last pair and no where as cumbersome. Although after prolonged use, they do tend to hurt the tops of my ears. But I have never had a pair of headphones that didn't hurt after a while.\n\nAll the sounds are crisp and nothing sounds hollow or artificial. I have some songs that are recorded pretty poorly and these seem to clean them up. Very nice headphones for the price."}
{"review":"Know what?  Can't do without this dynamic headphones.  Got headphones before but this AudioTechnica Professional headphone is superb in its class.  Bose does too good but this one match Bose to its sound crispness.  It picks up everything to its range and guess what?... cool and soft is the sound vibrations to your ears."}
{"review":"So far so good.  I've used them several times and have gotten good sound.  I am not a sound quality expert so if you're looking for a really high end head phone than you probably should be willing to pay for them.  These are great headphones for the price.  I used them on our worship team at church when I played bass and I could hear everything coming through the monitors."}
{"review":"Very nice piece of earphone. Sound quality is very good. For its price, can't ask more! Really enjoying.. Fits also well as it is adjustable. You can add it to most of ur devices. Has a long wire - can walk around also. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"review":"Ok for the money, not too comfortable if you're listening for a while and sound quality is descent coming from my macbook but I'm sure would sound better if I had a separate headphone amp or DAC."}
{"review":"I had a pair of sony mdr-7502 that I never really liked.\n These headphones sound really clear with good bass and mid-range.  I use these for recording and these seem to reproduce the sound good enough\nfor me to get a good mix on songs.  Very good high, low and mid range.\nThe sound isolation is Okay, blocks out most when the music is playing.  Really nice sounding, full range headsets.  Very comfortable, light, not so snug that it's uncomfortable but feels stable on your head."}
{"review":"I purchased these on a whim along with my Casio PX-150 and WOW. I can't believe how great the sound is. I have a number of other high-end headphones and these are right up there as far as sound quality. You can't go wrong for the money."}
{"review":"I ordered these for my daughter because she is completing an online program and needed true stereo headphones. They arrived quickly as expected and work great. My daughter uses them all the time now. The only problem we had is the cord protective spring at the plug portion has come loose.  It hasn't affected the performance however I worry that the end of the cable will break without the protection."}
{"review":"But there are few of us who actually need that level, and for the price these cannot be beat.  Believe me when I say I did quite a bit of research before settling on the final contenders, this one beat them hands down in a real world comparison."}
{"review":"I use these with my e-drum kit.  I can play without distrubing anyone else.  I can't figure out how drummers distrub anyone in the first place."}
{"review":"These are great.  I primarily use them to practice guitar without annoying the neighbors; however, they are becoming my first choice for listening to music as well.  They are comfortable, cut out background noise and produce quality sound from any device."}
{"review":"I had forgotten how brilliant sound can be via a good pair of headphones. After reading the positive reviews of this set, I ordered it and was not diasppointed.  One other person whom I had listen to the phones said he thought they could stand to have a bit more base but I didn't notice that.  I recommend them as a great sounding headphone at a budget price."}
{"review":"I am no expert but phones seem to have very good quality sound and good bass.  I mostly listen to my tv and mp3 and am very satisfied with their performance.  The 9 ft cord allows me some flexibility of use and that is nice also.  Have not tried any high priced phones so have no basis for that comparison but am very satisfied with my purchase."}
{"review":"I need really good noise-cancelling headphones for work. How well I can do my job depends a lot on how clearly I can hear every word that is being said in audio. I'm very happy I went with this brand. They are comfortable, and I can pick up a lot of spoken words I know I would miss with cheaper headphones."}
{"review":"I was surprised that there was such a large difference between the ATH-M30's and the M40's. the M30's don't seem to be as well made or sturdy as the M40's. I did not expect such a big difference. In spite of my disappointment regarding construction, I must admit that these headphones sound GREAT! I wear them to cut the grass because the over-ear design attenuates the sound of the lawnmower. For cutting the grass, the cord is much too long."}
{"review":"Just fantastic sound quality. Isolates outside sound well. Very comfortable. I wear these for 8 hours straight at work sometimes and it never bothers my big ears. Other headphones have always started eventually biting into me somewhere and leaving my ears sore. These are very sturdy, solid construction."}
{"review":"Its comfortable which is important because I use this at work for ~8 hrs everyday. i like how the cable plug has the metallic strain relief.  With my last earphones, the cable wrapping tore near the plug because it stayed in the same bended position for a long time. The sound is alright. I don't like playing things loud, but I think some sound quality is lost when I play on low volume."}
{"review":"It changes the volume when plugged to different machines. One of my Ipod has a cover, it can't plugged in. It uncomfortable when I put it on my head, just foe a few minutes, I don't know if I can endure it for thirty minutes or more."}
{"review":"For the price, I am satisfied with the sound quality and comfort when putting it on. I bought two other headphones around the same price range ( AKG K 518 LE and Ultrasone HFI-450 ) and I thought this is the best. I am not too sure if there are better ones at this price."}
{"review":"These are incredibly comfortable, even for my larger head, I can wear them all day with no issues.\n\nThe sound quality is VERY clear. They don't highlight or diminish any frequencies, everything sounds very crisp and natural. I'm noticing new small nuances in albums I've listened to dozens of times! I found them superior to Sony, Panasonic, and Sennheiser. I've gone through more than a few headphones and I'm going to stick with this brand.\n\nSturdy construction: metal headband, THICK, long cord, high quality metal jacks, screw-on 1\/4\" jack attachment (looks real high quality), soft earcups. Nice to wear in my studio, as they don't block out 100% of the outside noise so I can still hear other people trying to get my attention, but I never feel like too much noise is getting in."}
{"review":"I love the audio quality on these. I'm not an audiophile so wouldn't know exactly how good they are, but they're much better than standard cheap headphones.\n\nThe more I wear these, though, the more uncomfortable they are. I've had these for almost a year now, and I've worn them for many hours. A lot of days, I will want to wear my headphones for many hours on end. At first it was only a little uncomfortable, but now it's somehow gotten worse to the point where I almost can't stand to wear them for long periods of time if I don't have to.\n\nThe cushions completely surround my ear just fine, and taking my glasses off does nothing to solve the problem (though I haven't tested this extensively because I can't see with them off anyway). I think the issue is from the flat part on the inside (sorry, I'm not familiar with the terminology) pressing against the outer edge of my ear. And it's not like my ears stick out, but I think a flat, hard surface pressing against your ear WOULD hurt. The flat part just isn't far enough away - there's no slope in it to follow the ear back while still being close to the ear. If you look at part that faces your ear from the side, it really is very flat looking, like it doesn't even try to conform to an ear shape. I think maybe this cold be solved with more padding in the back to lift it away from the ear but I dunno\/never tried it.\n\nFor all my complaining I still like it. It hasn't broken on me yet or gotten one-side-syndrome. My last pair had a very uncomfortable part that rests on your head that kind of dug into your scalp, and the top is very comfortable on this one. If you have music playing these block sounds pretty good. The cord is super super long, if you're into that (mine is coiled and tied up to make it shorter and it's still too long, but I'd rather have it too long than too short). I've dropped these a few times and they're still fine.\n\nI don't know that I'd recommend this if you want to wear them like you live in them (like 8+ hours every day or something - which is pretty much how much I wear them - thought now it's painful to wear them after an hour or two) but everyone is different, and many reviewers like them so it's your call... I also bought these when they were much cheaper.. (they're $60 at the time of this review). I wouldn't buy them again unless I REALLY couldn't find something cheaper with good quality. But I won't get rid of them because they're still in nice condition and work well."}
{"review":"Friend recommended this brand, and I was a bit leery at first, and while I am no audiophile and don't 'get' most hyper-expensive headphones these are a must have for the price-point.\n\nThey're fairly comfortable, the style is not obnoxious, the cord is long, and the sound quality is amazing. While I am sure some proselytes will harp on about the absolute \"need\" for some $200+ headphones, these really all the normal person needs, and they are a need."}
{"review":"Best head phones I've ever owned. I know they're not top of the line, but they are great for me! Not much for bass and that's fine. The music I listen to doesn't require a lot of bass. Comes with a long cord."}
{"review":"The tone and quality are awesome. I use these for my home studio for mixing my music. Way better than the Shure headphones I had."}
{"review":"Quite a few people have written audiophile reviews on this guy so I'll leave it to the basics. The quality is amazing for the price, it's comfortable, and the quality is top notch. The cord is really really long, and is not retractable, so if your using this for travel keep that in mind. When I say long, thing how long 11 feet is and then imagine managing that on a plane or in a car. My wife did travel with this, she just used a sandwich tie and rolled most of the cord up and was good to go.\n\nGreat Product."}
{"review":"These are a solid set of headphones.  My only complaint is that they buzz a little bit if you don't have music playing.  The fit is quite comfortable, though."}
{"review":"I'm a beginner recording artist, so I needed nice studio monitors! and this seemed like the best choice since there are such great reviews.\n\nI record metal\/alternative\/funk\/halloween music and these headphone hit hard with the guitars, drums and bass.\n\nI strongly recommend these if you are serious about recording music!:) I love them!"}
{"review":"I chose to give this item 5 stars because it's definitely worth the price! Awesome sound and even better when you start playing with the equalizer on your phone.\n\nIf you are looking for good headphones for a reasonable price, this item would be a great choice."}
{"review":"I love these headphones.  The sound quality is excellent and the price was terrific!  They are very comfortable.  The cord is quite long as made for professionals in a studio I guess, but this also allows free movement while plugged into anything stationary.  If you want it only for your Ipod, or other small portable device, then the cord is a little cumbersome."}
{"review":"I got these to replace a cheap ($4-$5) pair of earbuds.  At first I thought that they sounded cheap until I realized that the reason was that the earbuds had been smearing frequencies.  These headphones show off all of the artifacts from the low bit-rate encoding that I was listening to.  For good quality audio they sound great."}
{"review":"I'm not a big audiophile but like having nice sound reproduction and depth. This pair does a nice job for my style of listening and comfortable to wear for a long session."}
{"review":"They fit nice and tight without wiggling around or falling off like my Sennheiser's, but not too tight like some have complained. I've never been an audiophile so I cant attest that they've got the best sound quality, but the quality is as good as I would expect. There are three negatives about these headphones, but one is just a matter of preference. The first is that that they snap together very hard whenever you take them off, I hope that doesn't effect their longevity. The second, more minor negative is that the ear pieces swivel 180 degrees where they point outwards, I don't understand why they would design it like that, every time I go to put them on one ear piece needs to be swiveled inward, like I said, real minor complaint. The third, and this is completely a matter of preference, the cord is too long. I prefer to have a shorter cord on the head phones, and an extension cord where I need it the extra length, though had I properly read the product description I would have known that before hand.\n\nOver all I like these headphones so far, I hope they last."}
{"review":"These are no ear buds, much better than I expected.  When they say Studio Monitor, they aren't kidding, you hear layers of music from your source that you just don't hear through most speakers.  A++"}
{"review":"I use these for editing videos and they work great for that. The cord is very long so I am constantly running over it with my chair but then it is nice if you need to get up and go to the bathroom and can't be bothered taking your headphones off.\n\nOkay, the cords not really that long..."}
{"review":"These are a great pair of cans, clear sound, powerful bass. However, they are too tight, if you use them for 3+ hours prepare to be in pain."}
{"review":"I got these headphones to replace an old pair of headphones that broke and wow, what a difference! I was just looking for something passable, but instead got something wonderful! The audio reproduction through these headphones sound great, with just the right mix of frequencies. I use these as studio headphones in my little home studio for recording as well, when necessary. The only downside I've had is that these aren't as comfortable as I would like - they get uncomfortable for me after 30-45 minutes usually."}
{"review":"I bought this for a more comfortable listening experience. The headphones are comfortable and don't sit tightly on my head. The ear pads can get a little hot\/sweaty and uncomfortable."}
{"review":"I am not an audiophile but I can tell you these headphones are comfortable and sound good to me.  I bought these headphones so I could listen to music or videos late at night and be sure not to disturb my neighbors and for car rides.  For these purposes these work great."}
{"review":"My son wears them everywhere.  I do wish the same model came with a shorter cord. . .  I could use them with a 3' cord."}
{"review":"I've bought Audio Technica mics in the past and have been impressed with their products so I thought I'd give these a try.\nI ordered a used pair and they arrived promptly and in good order with a little wear on the inside of the top head pad. Not a problem for me. I've been doing some home recording projects and these headphones are much more accurate than the twenty dollar Sony's I was using. The spring tension is quite tight and I experience some ear discomfort after a couple hours. At that point it's pretty much break time anyway. The clarity and definition of reproduced sound is probably beyond what you might expect out of phones in this price range. I am satisfied with my purchase and will probably upgrade to another AT product in the future."}
{"review":"These headphones have them wear it counts..  Great audio with the perfect amount of bass.  I use them primarily to monitor audio for television commercials and they work amazingly.  Listening to music or movies on a tablet or iPod also sounds great.  They aren't flashy like Beats but they sound better and probably won't get stolen from you.  Understated but with a lot of power.\n\nONLY drawback, and this is really nitpicking, is the super long cable.  It gets tangled under my chair wheel sometime BUT I'd rather have too much cable then not enough."}
{"review":"Don't waste your hard-earned money on Beats by Dre or Bose headphones. These puppies will deliver the goods for a fraction of the cost. Chump change, even.\n\nGood highs and lows, very comfortable for long periods of time. I record music and can have these sit on my ears for hours before feeling any cartilage discomfort."}
{"review":"Kid absolutely LOVES his headphones, a friend of his had a pair and we were able to track down the headphones through Amazon! Great sound!"}
{"review":"I bought these because of the excellent price and good reviews. I use them for Live Sound work and to also just listen to music on my I-Touch and cell phone. I think that they are great and have great sound quality."}
{"review":"So I just got my&nbsp;&nbsp;and holy crap, am I impressed. Impressed enough to write my first Amazon review.\n\nYou *really do* hear things you've never heard before, music clarity is great, bass is beast, and the headphones are snug, but comfortable (and I wear glasses so this is many times NOT the case).\n\nBuy this.\n\nList version:\n\nPros -\nEverything\n\nCons -\nCan't think of one.\n\nNote - I wasn't expecting the cord to be as long as it is, but that isn't a con. Not an issue if you're buying for a home setup, but if you're a commuter, something to consider."}
{"review":"I did extensive research before I bought headphones. These were by far the best for my price range, which happened to be $35. I would say the the only thing that I wasn't expecting was how the long the actual cord is. I think it's something like 5 ft. That sounds nice on the screen but when you try to plug it into your front facing headphone jack, you're left with a s*** ton of it just laying on the ground. This isn't the worst of complaints but the only one I can give it. A++"}
{"review":"When you're designing a product intended to be worn for hours at a time, making sure it is comfortable to wear is key. These, on the other hand, clamp to your head so tightly it hurts. You can go on and on about the sound quality but if something is actually painful to use, what's the point?"}
{"review":"For my 'untrained' ears, these are great.  Keep outside noise to a minimum and they seem to balance out the sounds of my music for a nice full rounded sound."}
{"review":"I am a casual music listener (not an audiophile...yet) and, before purchasing the ath-m30's, have never owned any over the ear headphones. I wanted to increase the quality of my music listening experience but stay under $100. After doing some research, it appeared that these would be the best value and wow, they have not disappointed! Music has never sounded so crisp and clear. The cans are very comfortable; I wear them for extended periods of time and do not experience any discomfort (although my ears will get a tad sweaty sometimes).\n\nAs I have never experienced other higher end headphones, I have nothing to compare these to but they sound great to me. The bass (which some reviews have knocked) sounds great to me coming from ear-buds. These come highly recommended."}
{"review":"These headphones came with good delivery speed.  Works well and has clear sound.  Comes with 1\/4 inch attachment, which adds a plus to the product."}
{"review":"Needed a replacement for my ageing headphones (plastic covering on earpads was sluffing off).  These are very acceptable for sound quality -- a bit tight on my head, though."}
{"review":"Now, they aren't like my Harman Kardon NCs or my Bose QC3s, but they are a great headphone for the value. Audio quality is good, they are comfortable, and they are all around a great headphone."}
{"review":"I play videogames competitively for money (leagues) and I make music just as a hobby and I was looking for 4-5 star quality headphones that fit my needs and my budget. I specifically wanted (1) closed-ear and (2) comfortable headphones.\n\nFrom a gamer's point of view, these headphones are definitely a great choice.\n1. Great precision of sounds to tell directions of gunshots or footsteps that are heard.\n2. Great balance of bass and treble.\n3. Sound leak is not a concern. Sound does leak, but the volume must be at high levels to do so. This makes it excellent for using with a mic of any sort since it will not pick up any sound from your headphones, making your voice crisp and clear. (Modmic would be a great choice).\n4. Comfortable for long gaming sessions.\n\nFrom a music maker's point of view these headphones serve its purpose well.\n1. Great balance of treble & bass\/meant for playing all sorts of genres.\n2. Comes with a 1\/4-inch adapter and 11 foot cable.\n3. Comfortable for long studio\/jamming sessions.\n\nThe little downsides are: (1) 11-foot cord can makes things a hassle at times (but who would be mobile with these???); (2) sounds aren't as detailed as they could be as they are with the ATH-M50s (which are not that steep of a price).\n\n For anyone on a budget looking for some new cans that performs excellently, these are a wise choice. :D"}
{"review":"These sound great and wearing 'em on your head feels like huggin a big fat guy: it just feels right. Cord's ridiculously long but whatevs."}
{"review":"Earbuds ruin hearing and are uncomfortable ...bought these to use while listening to meditation and music CD's..l am pleased with fit and quality of sound"}
{"review":"The bass in these are absurd. They'll start hurting your ears after a few hours, but you can bend the headband part to any shape pretty easily to release the pressure on your head. The ear pieces also adjust to be longer. Cheap, super long cord (great for sitting at desks), and great quality. Worth every penny."}
{"review":"Pros:\n- for cheap headphones the sound is pretty great.\n- the wire is really thick and is much longer than I was really expecting or needed. Great if you are trying to work with the same pair of headphones around an office\n- They were delivered the day after I ordered them without Prime\n\nCons:\n- Lack of comfort. after just an hour of wearing the headphones the top of my head hurts as do my ears from the cups. I would consider myself to have an average sized woman head and pretty small ears but even my ears are smashed by the padding. I'm really sensitive to headphones on my head and these really hurt. I can ease the tightness to prevent it from digging into my head but then it really hurts my ears even more.\n\n- Lack of noise canceling: I got these to work in an office to not completely block out sound but to at least muffle it. I can ear everything around me, even the conversation two cubes away."}
{"review":"These headphones are absolutely amazing! These headphones give a great \"flat\" response so bass-heavy users beware (not to say the bass is bad just not strong), they are very comfortable, and very affordable!"}
{"review":"First of all These things rock! The sound quality is as good as my desktop speakers or tv sound system ( which since I don't have a great \"ear' is great). I don't think I could have done better for $50. THe only issue is that the cord is 11 feet long which is waaay to long and I missed that detail when I ordered. That said that is more my fault then theirs and if thats what I have to do for a $50 pair of head phones that are this good it ill deal. Would buy again (unless they break in the next 6 months in which case these aren't durable enough) That said they feel very solid much more than my skullcandies."}
{"review":"I actually ordered these by mistake, confusing them for the noise canceling variety also sold by Audio-Technica. That was my mistake so I decided to live with it. I tried to use these on the plane yesterday and it was an abysmal failure. I could barely hear anything coming from my ipad, even with the volume turned all the way up. I used them in the house though, and they sounded decent. One of the main problems, even in the house, is the exceedingly long cord that comes attached to them. This thing must be at least 8 feet. It's unwieldy."}
{"review":"I have had the ATH-M30 headphones for over 1 year and they are great headphones for under $50. I have used them with my laptop, iPad and home theatre system and the sound is fantastic for headphones in this price range. The only complaint is that after extended wear time (over 2 hours) they do sometimes become a little uncomfortable."}
{"review":"Great set of cans with a super price from the warehouse. Nice tonal qualities for general work and enjoyment. At this price point you want clarity but don't expect the accurate reproduction of sound these deliver."}
{"review":"Maximum value for your money. Sound is very clear. Lacks good bass. I'll definitely recommend you to buy if you are looking for good headphones under $50."}
{"review":"Like others have said, the jack does not fit properly in my device so no sound out of one side. Poor engineering I guess...save your money."}
{"review":"Am I missing something here? The product details and other reviews seem like a joke. Do I need to download something to utilize these headphones? My MDR-V150 headphones I got 5+ years ago work better than these and I think the bass\/stereo broke in one ear. Plus they are more comfortable."}
{"review":"I have had these headphones about a month now and I think they work great for the price. These are now really expensive headphones so they do not have too much base or too much volume but I think they are enough for me, its plenty loud. I love the fact that they have the cable only coming out of one side and it is plenty long. Cable is very thick and looks durable. Would recommend."}
{"review":"These headphones are affordable, yet are delivering quality audio.\n\nMy ears get pressed down easily and hurt after a while with any headphones. Although these are not an exception, they are definitely better than most headphones out there."}
{"review":"I use these with my home computer, so I'm not at a mixing board or anything, but I do listen to a lot of music or watch tv\/movies while I work. I got a great deal on these, so that helps. In any case, I'm entirely pleased with my purchase, and would definitely buy them againI'm considering another pair for my computer at work. The sound is rich, the headphones do a good job of blocking outside noise, and despite being solidly constructed, they are very light. The cord is really long, which to me is a bonus, I don't get the whiplash effect from moving farther away from the computer than the cord allows. Hardcore audiophiles may have more stringent requirements of their headphones, but for me, these sound great at a great price."}
{"review":"I have another pair of Pioneer headphones that were around the ear, and they were much much more comfortable.  They were in the same price range.  The Pioneer headphones did not sound quite as good, but I would rather it not sound quite as good as long as my ears don't start to hurt in a short time.  I could literally wear the Pioneer's all day without discomfort, and I can't go an hour with the Audio-Technica set without needing to remove them.\n\nQuality for the price: 4 stars\nSound for the Price: 5 stars\nComfort for the price: 3 stars (this was important enough that it was the overall score I gave)"}
{"review":"For the price $44.00 it is a very good product. It isolate the noises quite perfect when the volume it is in a medium level. But when the volume goes higher you can heard some noise produced by the headphone. I use it in the office = perfect. For professional use look to something better."}
{"review":"Right out of the box I was blown away.  I have heard things with these that I've never heard in 10+ years of listening to certain music. It is great for video games and comfortable for extended wear."}
{"review":"For the price these headphones went above and beyond in quality of sound. Very comfortable wearing and excellent quality. I am using these for my electric Piano and love it"}
{"review":"They look & feel great but I cannot so-far get what\nmust be a high Impedance to be compatible & work\non the too-small devices I've tried them on. They may\nbe more compatible with heavier duty, studio-type sound\nequipment. I'll try some go-arounds when I find the time."}
{"review":"These headphones are comfortable and sound amazing.  You won't be disappointed!  The cord is very long which can be great and a pain at times."}
{"review":"Not great set, or wonderful set.  But good set.  Good base, good overall sound.  But I got these under $50 and that is what you get for $50, a good set.  I would reccomend these."}
{"review":"After searching for months for a pair of headphones that gave spectacular sound without a ridiculous pricetag, I am happy to say that these fit the bill and exceeded my expectations. Definitely a good buy for anyone interested in balanced, tight sound."}
{"review":"A waste of money, almost.  No Volume, no matter what I plug it into I have to turn the volume to maximum in order to hear it, then you run the risk of blowing your speakers out if you unplug and forget to turn the volume back down first.  It sounds ok once you max out the volume though.  Not great sound, but about what you would expect from any old headset or ear buds, not any better that other units I've listened to."}
{"review":"Bought these headphones to listen to music and watch TV on my pad.  These meet the bill nicely and were not overly expensive.  The cord is LONG, both good and bad.  The sound is great.  I'm sure not multi-hundred great, but great enough for my needs."}
{"review":"I bought it for 40 dollars. But somehow I think the sound quality is not as good as Klipsch IMAGE S4. In addition, large and heavy."}
{"review":"Ordered this through Amazon and received it in 2 short days. I am not a nutty audiophile by any means but DAMN! This headphones are awesome for the value! Blows whatever Bose that i have tried in store. Bass are deep but not overpowering the other sound elements. If you're looking for cheap cost and high end sound quality look no further. One thing though, it isn't as beautiful aesthetically as the other offerings in 5x the costs."}
{"review":"They sound  good but they are too tight.  I wear glasses and they press on my ears and are uncomfortable.\nI'm thinking headphones are one of those items that you need to try on before buying."}
{"review":"Having never had an expensive pair of headphones and going to these is just amazing at the difference in sound quality, build quality, and comfort. I would recommend these to anyone who wants a pair of headphones that are cheap and amazing quality."}
{"review":"Honestly, if you are buying headphones near this price point, you might not expect much. These headphones however blew me away!\nThey are extremely comfortable and sound fantastic. I use them while I dj and they feel perfect and sound great!"}
{"review":"These headphones sound amazing, especially for the price. They are also very comfortable when adjusted to your head size, but if you don't be careful how you wear them, you can be left with some embarrassing headphone hair! It also has a very long cable and doesn't require a go-between-cord-thing, which is preferable to a very short cable requiring an extension. It doesn't have a mic built in, but that's not really a negative thing against this product, since I bought it knowing it wouldn't have one. All in all, very good product, highly recommended."}
{"review":"The fit is good, and pretty comfortable.  I've used them basically for two days straight at work and they work very well.  I think once the metal stretches out just a tiny bit they will be perfect.  Extra long cable which is really nice because my tower is under my desk.  Good sound quality, and they are great for my desk because no noise cancelling so I can still hear when someone needs something."}
{"review":"Headphones are solid, work well, no problems with them so far. The price is also very reasonable, would recommend to someone looking for a reasonable pair of studio headphones"}
{"review":"Very comfortable to wear, sound is exceptional, I use them for Home recording, mainly Guitars.\n\nNice long cable and high quality fixtures used\n\nStrong and solid build"}
{"review":"I was pleasantly surprised at the overall sound quality of the ATH-M30 headphones.  It has been a long time since I've used headphones for stereo component listening, my previous phones being from Koss, Pioneer and Sennheiser.  It's impossible to make an A\/B comparison with those units, but I don't recall being more impressed with them than this one from A-T.  The bass is solid, not boomy, and the highs and midrange are natural.  Comfort is a big thing with me, and these meet my expectations on that requirement.  All in all, well worth the money."}
{"review":"These headphones by far have the best quality of any headphones that I've owned. Admittedly, my last ones were $20 sonys, but whatever the case, you can tell that these headphones give you the true sound of whatever you may be listening to.\n\n For $55, these headphones are unbeatable!"}
{"review":"After only a few weeks, the cord to male jack has weakened to the point that the sound often dims or cuts. out. I would not buy this again, I feel cheated."}
{"review":"I bought this item almost 5 months ago and has been using it regularly in my noisy office  and this just works great. Once you have it on, You have the best music and you feel like working alone which is very much needed for my software job. I am wearing this almost through out the day and it is really light and comfortable.\n  In all, I highly recommend this item to any one who wants good music,wants to be off in a noisy office."}
{"review":"I'm a voiceover artist on a budget but needed something to clearly listen to what my clients would hear. These are really great quality and inexpensive headphones and one of the best things about them is the super long cable that allows you to plug the headphones into your laptop and leave the laptop outside while recording in a closet!"}
{"review":"I put these on, plugged in my Nexus 7 tablet and watched some movies.  I was at my destination before I knew it.  The ear phones filtered out the surrounding noises well so I could enjoy my movie.  I am not an audiophile, just your average listener.  I rate them 5 stars because they do exactly what I needed.  To me the sound quality was great and I have no complaints.  Others seem to not like the long cord (just keep it in the small loop with the tie) but that did not bother me."}
{"review":"I had a hard time adjusting to head phones after listening to 4 Bose speakers for over 10 years. I moved temporarily to a place that would not allow me to turn my music up to the desired level. I have adjusted, but from time to time I hear static and I don't know if its the headphones or the CD player. They sound fine most of the time however."}
{"review":"I bought the ATH-M30's for my 15 year old nephew who loves music.  These headphones are extremely comfortable, providing a cushy yet snug fit around the ears.  The headband piece is also smooth with nice padding.  The headphones do not seem bulky at all.  The ear pads provide a nice seal around the ears that muffles outside sound.  I've tried on the Bose Executive headphones (which are $299.99 and are amazing) and these are in their league for initial comfort (not sure about long term wear comparisons however).  I have not had a chance to hear how they sound (have not given them to my nephew yet).  But these were super affordable at $55.00 and they look and feel way more expensive than that.  I'm super impressed so far!!"}
{"review":"The ATH-M30 beat my expectations with studio quality sound which many in-ear headphones could not beat.\nI use it as a replacement for my PC speakers and found it exceptionally better than any PC speaker."}
{"review":"These work better then the ones I had been using for the last 5-6 years. it cups my ears which I prefer instead of on hear or in ear. With the cup I get a pretty good seal. Cord is longer then I am use to.\n\nLove it it works."}
{"review":"I don't like ear bud headphones.  These are comfortable for wearing many hours per day.  I typically use mine for 30 hours per week, listening to the radio while I work on a computer terminal.  The separation is excellent, as is the sound quality.  I also like the long cable, which gives me many options for placing the radio for optimal reception.  The exact orientation of the cable is also useful for improving the quality of FM radio reception.  This headset works equally well when plugged into a computer headphone jack."}
{"review":"When I listen with these things on even on Low it blocks out  all sound from the outside so I can hear a thing and people cant hear what I'm listening too. This is a must have."}
{"review":"These headphones are comfortable and provide good sound.  However, they are not up to par with many other noise canceling headphones.  They do well to mitigate road noise when I am driving and listening to my phone, but for recording purposes, they are not good.  The price is good for the headphones earning a four star review."}
{"review":"For the price this set of headphones delivers really good sound and I am glad I got them as a backup for my wireless set."}
{"review":"LOve the case,its a good quality case for the price. It has a opening for the rear camera and front camera. It also comes with a free stylus and can convert to a pen."}
{"review":"I use these with my Ipod to listen to books while I mow the fields. It acts as a sound dampener for the mower and I can listen to my books instead of being bored mowing."}
{"review":"Not audiophile quality, but excellent for casual listening. Gave them to a friend, but liked what I heard. Not sure why I bought them in the first place. Just wanted to try them."}
{"review":"They are NOT as good as their big brother, the ATH-M50, which I think is the absolute best of any headphone I've ever owned and I've owned many different types of headphones over the years.  But having said that, the ATH-M30's are very good headphones.  They produce very good sound across all levels of the music.  They are well-made, comfortable and are a much lighter and also cost much less than the M50's.  While not up to snuff with the M50's, these are still a very good set of headphones."}
{"review":"He said it was better than listening without them. Made the sound much clearer. Mom says it gives her some quiet time when Dad has his music on."}
{"review":"I bought these for my 18 year old daughter. She has a terrible habit of playing on her IPad with earphones on, yet interrupts every conversation we have because she can hear what we are saying.  These earphones aren't completely soundproof, but they have done wonders for us. She has to take them off to hear what we are saying unless we scream when we talk. She's a picky kid but loves the feel of the headphones - how nice not to hear her complain.  I highly recommend this product!"}
{"review":"These are a step down from one of the most popular and well-reviewed Audio-Technica models. I am thrilled with them, and others I've had test them out were quite impressed. I use them for music, video games, and audio transcription. I love the fact that the cord is quite long as well."}
{"review":"Exactly what I wanted and expected. Some reviews said that they were uncomfortable but I think they fit great. The cord is extra long but that is a good thing if you need to move around a lot. I use them to plug into my guitar amp when I need to be quite and the long cord allows me to stand and move around. Sound quality is also very good."}
{"review":"Have owned these headphones for about 1.5 years and have been very satisfied. Sound quality is very good for its price range (especially on the lows), and it still works like a charm even after multiple drops, unceremonious use, etc. I've had no problems with discomfort from long-term use (your head size may vary), the padding is intact, and the cable shows little\/no signs of wear. Overall a great buy!"}
{"review":"I don't know much about audio quality. I just want to put that out there first. But I know that these headphones have lasted me almost two years exactly which is rare in how much I abuse my headphones. I am so happy with how long these have lasted and they only have some cosmetic stuff wrong with them. I luff you, headphones."}
{"review":"I bought a Audio-Technica ATH-M30 headphone to replace a Sennheiser PX 100-II, which lost connection to left side after a year and half usage.  I liked the review comments of the sound quality of the ATH M30 head phone.  Shipping and packaging of the new headphone is all very good.  However, the music is very faint and with high pitch noise when using with my laptop.  It works with other laptop and desktop computer.  Examining its Specification I realized this ATH-M30 has a higher impedance at 65 ohm while Sennheiser PX 100-II has a 32 ohm impedance.\n\nThe vender approved a return and refund, however, it requires buyer to pay for the initial free shipping and return shipping.  I decided not to return it because returning would mean I will pay half of the price of ATH-M30 for nothing.  Now I bought another Sennheiser PX 100-II.  ATH-M30 still sits in its original packaging and maybe someday I will find a good use of it.\n\nIn summary, if one thing can be improved to avoid similar problem happen to others will be to add a remark to the product description that \"ATH-M30's higher impedance may not work well with some laptop and portable audio devices\".\n\nA Causal Music Listener"}
{"review":"I use these headphones mostly for podcasting, but occasionally to listen to music or movies on my macbook or iPod.  These over-the-ear headphones are incredible."}
{"review":"I bought these for home, to listen to music or audio books in the evening while my wife is reading in bed. I wanted something similar to Sennheiser HD 280 pro, but without the cost (I have a pair that my employer gave me, but I keep those at work).\n\nThese are NIIIICE. For someone with single-sided deafness, I can't talk about stereo sound, but I can tell you that I love the range of sound these reproduce. I think that they sound nicer than the Sennheisers that I previously mentioned, which is great when you are buying them at the fraction of the price."}
{"review":"I love these headphones. They sound great. I wear them for hours at work and they are very comfortable. I would recommend these headphones to everyone. Great value for such a price."}
{"review":"I have big ears, and for me these don't work very well. The cushioning presses down on the top of my ears so they get sore. I'd recommend these for just about anyone else however, as the sound is good. They even came with a jack for a guitar amp so I was pleased. I would keep them if they were comfier."}
{"review":"These phones work well with an iPod, and if you like bass, turn on the bass control on the iPod.  Nothing refined about the sound in comparison with expensive phones, but enjoyable sound on the mellow side.  If you use a headphone amp, they work better with a tube amp rather than a solid state one in my opinion.  I'm happy with them."}
{"review":"The criteria for sub-$50 headphones are as much about avoiding nasties as they are about seeking virtues.  If you can get a unit without design flaws that torture your head or cause other annoyances, quality flaws that cause it to break, or sonic flaws that distract from the listening, you're most of the way there. The high fidelity stuff is gravy.  The ATH-M30 covers the basics well with more than a little gravy thrown in.\n\nThe design can be best described as basic, low bulk, and light weight.  The band is fully padded, with a decent amount of extension that allows full ear coverage.  The resistance is sufficient to keep the band in adjustment.  The tension is sufficient to keep the lightweight headphones in place through a range of movement, but not excessive.  The earcups are shallow.  The cushions are covered with crinkly vinyl and pliable, forming a good conforming barrier.  There is some contact between my ears and the soft fabric liner.  I have no problem wearing these cans for hours, but they might not work for someone with protruding ears.  The cord is robust and reinforced at the earcup and the plug end.  The plug end is nickel plated metal and a screw-on 1\/4\" adapter is included.  The dreaded Y cord is avoided.  The cord is also excessively long for a straight cord, and is kind of a PITA to manage.  That's my only real complaint on the design.\n\nThe sound quality is mostly accurate and well defined, with good reproduction of detail in mid to upper range acoustic sounds.  You can actually hear the key noises on Sonny Rollins' saxophone and the nuances of brush slaps on the snare drum.  Piano transients and timbre are reproduced in vivid detail.  The bass response is deep, but kind of mushy and artificial in comparison.  Not boomy or anything, just not as defined as the mid to upper ranges where the definition is surprisingly good.  Bass transients are muted.  I agree with the reviewer who surmised that there was a tweak done to boost the bass on drivers strong in the middle to upper range, with a lower fidelity bass result.  Maybe the shortfall in bass fidelity would be less noticeable for more electronic sounds.  Another thing that separates these cans from a true audiophile set is dynamic range.  It isn't especially impressive, so there isn't that same punch and sense of presence that you get with a true audiophile set.  So the combination of accurate, detailed mid to upper range reproduction without the dynamic oomph of a true audiophile set seems to be what earns the title of \"studio monitor.\"  And that level of performance is a big bonus in this price range.\n\nWith 65 ohms of impedance, the gain is relatively low.  That's not a problem for my media-oriented laptop with its powerful audio system, but someone using it with a lower powered device might not be satisfied.  And the cord is too long for mobile use anyway."}
{"review":"I bought these headphones looking for professional grade performance, with a comfortable fit and at a most price. I am happy to report that these fulfilled all of my requirements! When I bought them, they were only $40. They fit comfortably on my head and expand if needed. The cushions around them are very comfortable.\n\nThe most important part - the music sounds amazing. Bohemian Rhapsody (who doesn't love that song?) sounds fan-freaking-tastic. It's amazing to hear, honestly. I have never experienced quality like this for such a great price! Now, if you're looking for fashion or extreme portability, eh, maybe look elsewhere. I'm using these primarily at home, so I'm not too worried about the super long cord -- and by long, I mean long. It's HUGE. The design is extremely practical, but that's doesn't detract from anything.\n\nAs a side note, the plug-in end of the earphones is reinforced so it is less likely to break!\n\nI would definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for a less expensive route for audio."}
{"review":"great value and delivered on time and as described.  great sound and i have a larger head and was great except not comfortable for hours of listening."}
{"review":"This headphone sounds so much better than the $59 headphone I bought a few years back. This is also built better. The only reason I needed a new headphone was that my old one was breaking up - the sponge was falling out. I don't see how that would happen with this headphone because it is build with a very compact cushioning which to me is very good for the sound and comfort of the headphone. I bought two of these - one for myself and one for a Audio Visual System that needs constant monitoring. This works perfect for home and work."}
{"review":"These phones are decent. They do the trick. I use them for an electronic drumset, and while they work fine, if I pump music through them, or turn them up, the phones kind of burp a little on the bass and floor toms. For the money pretty good though."}
{"review":"As the title says, good sound, could use more bass, but very well balanced.  Comfortable band and endures all day without hurting my ears.  I'd buy again, next step up with noticeable improvement it twice the price."}
{"review":"In the sub $100 category (and I paid substantially less than that) these are outstanding headphones. The sound is crystal clear at all frequencies and they are extremely comfortable to wear for extended periods. I would thoroughly recommend them to anyone."}
{"review":"I honestly wasn't expecting that much from these as I'd never owned a pair of Audio-Technica headphones. I was in a pinch and needed some new cheap headphones and decided I'd give these a try. Wow. The range. The comfort. The PRICE! I am very pleased with these and would highly recommend them to any friend needing a pair."}
{"review":"This headphone offers great sound at a very reasonable price. It fits comfortably on my head allowing for long periods of uninterrupted wear. The frequency response is nice and even, making the sound less tiring to the ears.\n\nWhen compared to my DJing headphones by Allen&Heath, these offer less noise isolation an sturdiness. Also, they are not foldable making transporting them without a proper case a bit risky - especially considering the exposed wiring (visible in the picture) and fragile headband."}
{"review":"GREAT PRODUCT, FAST SHIPPING, AFFORDABLE PRICE, DEEP BASS, VERY HAPPY WITH MY ITEM. THANK YOU ! THE REVIEW HAS TO BE 2O WORDS BUT I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SAY LOL... IM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT AND I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE."}
{"review":"this is a steal for a headphone below $50! the cables were too long so i braided mine ( you can watch youtube vids on how to do this) and it actually looks better now."}
{"review":"not gonna say much but they are SO comfortable on my head, the sound is pumping. Just buy the damn things, you won't be disappointed."}
{"review":"But it sounds okay. And I have a large head. So beware, big-heads. The padding around the ears and crown of your head are insufficient."}
{"review":"I'm hardly a super high end user, but have done some radio work and roadied a bit. Broke my old cans (which I thought were so great) in an unrelated incident and my wife bought me these. Wow. Sure, mine were old, but top of the line when made. These are like a whole new dimension in headphones. I'm sure there are things that sound better (which I'll carefully avoid getting used to unless they're not in the $500 range) but these are awesome. Comfortable, great range, long cord, came with a studio plug."}
{"review":"For a pair of headphones under 50 bucks I guess they're nice. I can see why they were reduced to such a low price though.\n\nThey're very comfy so that's a huge plus. Sound quality I wouldn't say is the best I've heard for this price."}
{"review":"Given the good reviews, I ordered these as a pair of relatively inexpensive headphones (~$48) to replace the cheap (`$20) but quite good Sony MDR-V150s that I sat on and broke.  These headphones were more than twice as expensive as the ones I broke and were about twice as bad.  They had poor clarity, sharpness and an overall muted-muddy sound.  I returned them and replaced them with a set of Sony MDR-V6 which were a little more expensive (~$68) but way better.  I must admit though, if you are not a professional musician and want just an excellent pair of basic headphones, the Sony MDR-V150s have great overall sound clarity and power and the more expensive MDR-V6 is only a bit better, despite costing more than twice the price.  I like and listened to a range of music- classical, pop, rock, alternative, world, hip-hop, techno, etc. and judged the quality of these headphones listening to my itunes collection via computer."}
{"review":"Just got these today and I'm impressed!\n\n I've been too busy with work, Grad school, and life in general to enjoy music.  I re-discovered my love of music, when I purchased a HTC One Cell Phone (with Beats Audio) I've been using the HTC One to listen to music in my car and was amazed with the sound quality.  So I borrowed my daughter's Skull Candy Skullcrusher and was impressed, some more! So I took it to the local Best Buy to try other headphones and was impressed with the various options.  Of course, the more expensive ones like \"Beats\" Headphones sounded the best but I just did not want to spend the hundreds of dollars.  I agree with all of the great reviews that this is a great set of headphones!  Everything from Red Hot Chili Peppers to Haydn, sound amazing. The Bass in Red Hot Chili Peppers \"Higher Ground\" is unbelievable, as well as the beautiful voice of Sara McLachlan, And  Yo Yo Ma's Cello Haydn Cello Concerto in C major is absolutely beautiful! For under $50, these headphones are a great value.  For a audiophile on a budget, these cannot be beat.\n\nMike"}
{"review":"Sound quality is very good, Earcups do a good job of excluding ambient sounds, mainly because they grip your skull like a vise. Can only wear them for half an hour then have to put ice on my earlobes.  Oh, and the cable is about 100 feet long."}
{"review":"These over-the-ear headphones produce great sound in an inexpensive package. Combined with an amplifier they sound great. Your portable devices may be maxed out when watching a movie or listening to loud music. All heads are different; but these start to hurt my ear cartilage after about an hour of use. They have a very long cord and a 1\/4\" screw-on adapter."}
{"review":"Definitely not the best in terms of sound quality or bass reproduction, but they are definitely the best pair of headphones you can get for the price range. I use these mostly for gaming and they provide a much better experience than my old turtle beachers. If you don't mind the lackluster bass, these headphones are perfect for almost anything."}
{"review":"Great sound for that price. I started hearing sound in songs which I've never heard before. The cord is tough and the audio plug is also durable. There's a good depth of sound and the outside world doesn't know about it.\nI listen mostly to metal\/classic music. Everything sound great - guitars, drums and violins.\n\nI'm really happy with that product, next time I'll go with the better version of those headphones.\nThanks."}
{"review":"decent sound but i'd be damned if you can't hear every bloody sound around you as if you didn't even have on phones. this one is going in the trash. no one should have to deal with the frustration."}
{"review":"I've used headphones for a long time, and this is the best sounding and most comfortable cans I've ever used at a price like this. The sound is balanced, with the midrange clearly audible and not swamped by artificial boosing of the bass and treble. And these are the first cans I've ever been able to forget I was wearing. I've worn them for up to 4 hours at this point with no discomfort. The sound is a small step down from the ATH-M50, but with a big step down in price. If you're looking for entry level audiophile headphones give these a try."}
{"review":"After trying out a few cheaper headphones at this or a slightly cheaper price level I picked these up.  These easily compare to $100-120 msrp headphones.  Probably one of the best values out there for something of decent quality and at a sub $50 price range.\n\nWhile not audiophile quality or high end by any stretch they are perfect for the office and do a decent job of blocking ambient noise."}
{"review":"I was looking for something with a closed-back for the office and these have been great. The sound is much better than some others I've tried in the price range. Construction seems good and the earpieces fit well."}
{"review":"I'm not an audiophile by any means, but these are a fantastic pair of headphones for cheap. They are comfortable (almost as comfortable as my Bose Triports) and I can wear them for long periods of time without having to take them off. They do make my ears sweat a bit, but that just comes with the territory.\n\nI'd say at the $30 price point you'd be hard pressed to find better value for your money."}
{"review":"I returned this set of headphones. The description said they have volume control, they don't.  I needed them for audio files that are often very quiet and require additional amplification.  Even with my computer up to 100% volume I could barely hear the audio.  Perhaps for other applications this product would do well."}
{"review":"Great set of affordable headphones for studio monitoring. Got these at an excellent price without having to compromise on audio quality. Audio-Technica is going to be my first choice in headphones from here on out."}
{"review":"Relatively low maximum volume off of a normal driver, but the response curve seems quite flat. Not terribly useful as headphones for a personal music player, but they sound great coming out of a full Roland keyboard.\n\nThe double size headphone jack is wonderful."}
{"review":"Good sound with no extraneous boosting, and very solid construction.  The cord's longer than I need it (I had to braid it to make it usable), but that's a personal issue.\n\nThe only real problem I have is that the padding is a bit thinner than I'm used to, so they press on my ears a bit after long periods of wear.  That's usually a sign that I should get up and stretch though, so it's not a big deal.\n\nI'll definitely consider Audio-Technica when I need another pair of headphones."}
{"review":"I ordered these headphones cuz they were highly ranked on the best sellers list. But I guess the best sellers list is not always indicative of a good product. These headphones have really bad bass. That's the only complaint I have so far. Like literally, the bass on my Galaxy S3 earbuds is better!"}
{"review":"Title says it all. The set is robust and therefore I expect it to last. I use mine for recording light music -- piano, acoustic guitar, vocals -- so they are sufficient enough to block out sound from the outside enough to allow me to hear what the mic is picking up.  They are easily adjustable and the cable is a good length.\n\nI gave it 4 stars because of the 1\/4\" adapter and 1\/8\" jack which are both plated with an alloy (gold in appearance but who knows) that makes their connection clean and secure. The adapter screws on, so that is a definite plus."}
{"review":"The sound that comes through these headphones is incredible, and for under $50!  I have been able to hear nuances in music that I would have otherwise never noticed.  True that more expensive headphones can deliver the same quality or much better, it becomes hard to notice the difference unless you work in professional music production.  For casual listeners, independent DIY musicians and producers, or hobbyists, nothing can beat the superb clarity of the rich bass, mids, and ringing treble tones that aren't harsh on the ear, and the large volume range free of sound distortion."}
{"review":"I'm not a music professional or anything but I love these headphones.  They have great sound quality (much better than your standard issue in-ear pods) and are great value for the price. They don't cancel outside noise but other people can't hear what you're listening to and they isolate pretty well with the music on.  You'd have to cough up more money to get complete noise cancellation.  I'd definitely but them again."}
{"review":"I bought this as a gift for my brother. It was good quality for an excellent price. He says he likes them a lot. They're not noise-cancelling, but they are noise-isolating."}
{"review":"I bought these headphones expecting a little upgrade from my apple headphones that i have been using for about 2 years. What I got was a HUGE upgrade as i could hear things in songs I never heard before. The separation of the instruments was great and just to clarify i listen to hip-hop, R&B, Classic Rock, Alternative, Classical, Jazz, and just about anything except country...(sorry y'all). The headphones were comfortable although my ears did get a bit sweaty. Something worth mentioning is that these cans are VERY PUBLIC FRIENDLY. By this i mean i cranked my ipod to max volume and could not hear anything but the music and people around me couldn't hear anything either. The only time they could hear the music was when I had them around my neck, but when they are on your ears...not a single sound. For 50 dollars, you can't go wrong with these and the sounds are very crisp and bright. The bass is great, and the treble is cool also. The only thing is that these may sound a bit quiet because they are monitor headphones but on a computer or laptop i don't see this being a problem. I recently sold these to upgrade to the MH50 but these are still great. If you are on the fence i would say not to worry and purchase these!!!!\n\nPROS:\n-Very crisp sound\n-Comfortable\n-Sleek look\n-Comes with an attachable plug-in for an amp\n-Cheap price\n-Good bass\n-Good treble\n-Seals in sound and keeps environment sounds out\n\nCONS:\n-Mids could be better\n-Needs a little bit of burn-in time for maximum potential (This means you need to listen to these headphones for a few hours for them to break in)\n-Can get a bit stuffy\n\nOverall these are great entry level headphones and way better than some crap skullcandys and over bassy beats"}
{"review":"As the title hints, they are not the world's greatest headphones, but they are worth the price.  Anyone looking for studio quality sound needs to look for studio quality phones.  I use these with my electronic drum kit, and the sounds are muffled compared to the last set I used, but definitely not so much that I'm upset or disappointed."}
{"review":"I would definitely buy these again. I use this headset at my computer for gaming and music. Very good sound overall. No complaints. A great deal, all in all."}
{"review":"These headphones have a wonderful clear sound, and plenty of punch all the way from the bass to treble range. Don't seem to muddy up in the lows or mids, or color the sound too heavily.\nIf you're using headphones to listen to Pandora on your work computer, remember that any sound deficiency compared to your best hi-fi equipment at home may well be down to a poor onboard soundcard rather than the headphones themselves, and therefore best to listen to any headphones on quality equipment to judge their ability.\n\nFit fairly comfortably, although I do start to notice they are there after an extended (3-4 hours or more) period of wearing them. Never have worn a set that didn't start getting uncomfortable after that length of time though.\n\nOverall, for the price, very impressed."}
{"review":"Tried this headphone which is a reasonable price with a reasonable sound quality.\n\nHeadphone looks quite cheap, sound quality is okay. I would give 2.5\/5.\n\nMost suitable for people who wants a good branding and affordable pricing.\n\nComfortable to use too."}
{"review":"I purchased these phones used though they were like new. Nice smooth response, good bass. They are loud enough without hurting your ears. The only problem I have is that my sons keep borrowing them so I have to hunt them down when I want to use them."}
{"review":"I have been using this headphones for two months and I am very satisfied.  Sometimes, I wear it for a while but I would not feel hot in my head; the sound is very good."}
{"review":"up until recently I was very impressed with the product. The price was good and the quality of the headphones great. However that all came to an end when for no apparent reason they stopped working."}
{"review":"I wanted headphones that sound better than $20 earbuds, but I'm not enough of a hard-core audiophile to pay $200 (let alone $2000) for cans.  I'm very happy with this choice: they sound great, and are comfortable to wear for hours and hours at work.\n\nThe main drawback with the headphones is the cord: it's long and the plug is huge.  This is okay if you're listening to music sitting on your couch plugged into your receiver.  But trying to use them with a mobile device is laughably awkward; I had to wrap up 2m of extra cord, and the plug won't fit into anything that has a case.\n\nSo a few days ago, I cut the cord down to about 1.5m and soldered on a new plug  one designed to fit into a recessed plug through an iPod or phone case.  Now a great set of headphones is a perfect pair of headphones.  If you'd like to do the same, there are three thin (30 gauge or so) wires in the cord: the blue one connects to the tip (left channel), the red one connects to the ring (right channel) and the yellow one connects to the sleeve (ground)."}
{"review":"this makes a great first headphone. i was confused at first  what to buy considering the variability in prices and manufacturers and i have never bought a headphone before. anyways i went ahead and bought it. i can't compare it against any other headphone becoz i haven't used anything else. but it sounds good. and as you might have read in other reviews, it is not noise canceling and the cord is really long. i have been using it for about 4 months now :)"}
{"review":"Honestly, I can understand why some people are giving this product reviews that are just okay, but I really am an avid music listener and this will probably give 99% of people a great music experience. I wore them for over 8 hours on a plane ride and I didn't feel they were uncomfortable at all, so I'm not sure why people keep complaining about that, they're really comfortable. The audio quality is really great, and the sound doesn't seem to leek to those around you, so that's good.\n\nThese aren't the best pair of headphones in the world, but they're not priced that way either. These are the best I've seen for anything near this price, and I'm really happy with them."}
{"review":"I use these headphones at work to drown out other noises while I'm coding.  I've found these headphones to be of good quality and comfortable to wear for hours on end.\n\nThe long cord is especially helpful as I often move around from one area to another within my office.  The tension reducer on the connection to my computer is also quite useful as I've had previous headphones that have failed due to stress on the connection.\n\nI would definitely recommend these headphones to others."}
{"review":"Professional? You have to be kidding me! The amount of line noise generated BY this headset makes it unusable. The headset has ok highs, muddy mids, and non existent lows. I did find the weight and fit to be quite comfortable and the single lead was also pleasant."}
{"review":"I mostly use these with our iPad watching netflix & they've been great so far. They are comfy to wear, sound is great & the price just can't be beat for what you get. I wish they collapsed for easier travel but you can't have it all. Great buy!!"}
{"review":"I bought the kids Dr Dre Studio and Solo and Bose earplug... Duh!  I will never buy a name brand for an uninformed child consumer. I purchased these based on Amazon reviews and I feel intelligent.  I'm happy with the surround sound effect I get when immersed in these headphones.  They transform the sound coming from my Galaxy III into my own personal concert.  Adapter is enclosed.  Use in standard headphone jack or old school (professional jack).  High quality and priced to compete."}
{"review":"You get a lot of bang for your buck with these headphones, I would recommend them to anyone who enjoys music. They still don't beat a good sound system with large speakers, but close enough."}
{"review":"I love these headphones. I can't hear anything outside them once I'm playing music. They are incredibly durable, very comfortable, and I love that they have a long cord. Also, I can't believe the awesome price I got them for."}
{"review":"These headphones sound fine, but make my ears hurt after a while. I like to wear my headphones while I work, and if I wear these for any length of time (more than an hour) my ears get really sore."}
{"review":"I love these headphones. I bought these to replace an old set of Sony headphones that finally wore out. I listened to dozens of sets (including the nearly omnipresent beats audio) and bought these without hearing them first (huge risk) based solely on reviews from other sites and they surpass all other sets and the beauty of it is they cost less than half of what the next best sounding pair I could find (Sony something, cannot find the model number right now but they were VERY good). No ear fatigue from ridiculously over processed bass other headphones try to pass off as \"fuller sound\". Just a beautiful sounding set of headphones for a great price. They are not stylish or sleek or a design fetishists dream, but they are comfortable and sound amazing. Function over form every single time and you can never go wrong.\n\nI was initially concerned about them not being noise cancelling but after 30 hours of airplane travel so far. I don't have any regrets. I am sure those that buy the noise cancelling sets are equally enamored with their purchases. Having owned both, I just don't see what the fuss is about. Plus, I don't have to carry extra batteries. Also, when not flying I use them around the house and it is fairly useful to be able to hear people when they need you, like perhaps a crying baby... They claim to be noise isolating... I don't really know what that means but I do not have to compensate for noisy atmospheres with more volume.\n\nBuy some beats audio or bose and you may not regret it, buy these and go nuts at the mp3 store (or itunes store if you prefer to pay full retail) and you definitely won't regret it.\n\nJust be sure to pay for your music, except for Metallica, never pay for Metallica."}
{"review":"While the sound is okay, the comfort level of these keep me from being able to wear them for more then an hour.  There is hardly any room for the ears with the hard back of the headphone pressing into the ears.  Very disappointed, and I gave them lots of time for me to adjust."}
{"review":"I received them today and they are wonderful. They are very comfortable and the sound is absolutely spectacular. As a college student in a large dorm, the fact that I can hear my music clearly even when I have it at a low volume is wonderful as it means it also is blocking out a hefty amount of outside noise. Nothing to complain about here."}
{"review":"They give me great but not LOUD sound. I have no issues hearing in virtually any environment and they are extremely comfortable. For the money, you can't beat these. Buy 'em."}
{"review":"I use these mostly to listen to British TV shows on Netflix because I watch on my computer and sometimes the sound isn't good enough to understand the accents and\/or slang.  They work great for that and I can hear much more clearly and in more detail.\n\nI guess I wasn't expecting them to be so tight and sound proof, but they were designed that way so my bad. I'm sure they are fine for studio work and great for listening to music.  Well designed.\n\nGreat sound for the price!"}
{"review":"Well worth the money.\nI have them on for hours and they work fine and\ndon't cause too much heat buildup.\nThe frame is very durable and the wire is tough.\nI have a habit of gnawing on the wire while listening to\nmusic and that has caused me to damage a lot of my\nprevious headsets.\nOverall the audio is superb in comparison to its price.\nThats why I give it 5 stars."}
{"review":"Really impressed with the sound quality and comfort. I was using an old pair of Sony headphones for Xbox gaming (mostly to reduce household friction) and I am hearing all sorts of new sounds with the ATH-M30's.\n\nSound deadening of external sounds is almost too good as I cannot hear when my \"supervisor\" is providing negative feedback. Base is deep and rich, not boomy.\n\nVery happy, just wish I had bought two pairs for the price I got."}
{"review":"I use these mainly when playing with Garage Band\nOn the iPad and I don't want to wake the kids.  I was concerned that the eleven foot cable would be a pain, but it turned out to useful; it 's amazing how much I have to walk around while recording or listening.  I'm not a high tech audio geek so don't ask me about performance data, all I can say is the sound I get is full and without any interference."}
{"review":"I loved this gift from my husband for Mother's day! No more missed dialogues. I can also watch my programs late at night without disturbing the rest of my family. Best of all, one set up works with both the TV, and the stereo volume. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs that extra hearing support."}
{"review":"After doing quite a bit of research I was looking for a pair of over-the-ear headphones to wear while at work. I chose this pair because it was on sale and had decent reviews. Now, having worn them for a little over a month, I agree with the reviews I read. The sound quality is solid, and the comfort is good for long term wear.\n\nI like the leather ear cups and the long cable (not coiled like the Senheisers I also considered). They are also not too heavy for long term wear.\n\nThey do get a bit warm after a while, but that is par for the course with almost any circum-aural headphone. It's nothing unbearable.\n\nI would recommend these headphones to anyone who is looking for a comfortable pair to wear for extended periods. They are not audiophile quality, but they are much better than ear-buds and more comfortable (for me at least) than most on-ear headphones I tried. And the price can't be beat!"}
{"review":"These earphones are good, comfortable, and well worth the money...when they are On Sale for $39.95. They come with an adaptor plug and a long cord."}
{"review":"Solid and great sounding. I would have loved a plug-in replaceable cord to better match the length and specifics of the use. Right now the cord is very sturdy and looks buit to last but swapping it out for something shorter or with an in-line mic or volume control would have been an asset."}
{"review":"I'm not an audio-phile so I cannot speak with any technical precision on their sound quality, but they work perfectly for my needs at a desktop computer. They're comfortable on my (large) ears, although the pads can get too hot after a while and I'll start sweating. The cord is quite long so I can move around the work area a fair amount.\n\nOnly had them a month so I can't judge their reliability yet, but so far I am satisfied. Definitely a world above the $15-$20 headphones I used to use at the computer."}
{"review":"I bought these headphones for noise cancellation.  However, when I play brown noise or white noise through them I can still hear my co-worker talking on the phone.  I won't return them because they do block some sounds.  For instance, when using the headphones to listen to music they do block out almost all the noise (except that one guy) around me.  Also, the sound quality is nice for listening to music.  Maybe I had too high of an expectation regarding noise cancellation.  The guy sits 30 feet from me and practically yells into his phone, but maybe I'm just asking too much from these headphones."}
{"review":"These bad boys are perfect. Comfy and great sound quality. Also that sale price was pretty awesome. I'll be using these for a long time."}
{"review":"I listen mostly to classical music and I was looking for a good set of headphones which won't lead me into near bankruptcy (which is often the case). At the last moment, after considering several options from Sony, Sennheiser, Grado and other brands, I opted for Audio-Technica's ATH-M30 Professional headphones based on its reviews and price. Perhaps in the future, when I hit the lotto, I'll go for a pair a Grado headphones; meanwhile, I'm satisfied with this nice sounding device."}
{"review":"Best at its price, hands down. Great clear sound quality, robust. I would definitely recommend it if your are looking for a cheap and a good headphone"}
{"review":"For the price we paid for these, they are excellent, well made headphones. The frequency response is in the average range, but except for the most discriminating listener, or the most sensitive music, it's really not going to make that much difference. My teenager loves them, and they keep the noise, I mean music, quiet for the rest of us. Very comfortable cushioned cups."}
{"review":"These headphones are very comfortable.  The sound is great.  The packaging was SUPER!!!  No scissors or any cutting to do.  Just release a few flaps and you are in the package.  I am very happy with this purchase."}
{"review":"I'm not a stererphile, so this review won't consist of numbers you don't understand and comparisons to other headphones from brands you can't pronounce at prices you can't afford.\nThey sound great, seem sturdy and fit my gigantic head.\nThe cord is extremely long which can be a good and a bad thing depending on how you use them.\nMuch better then my basic model SkullCandy headphones."}
{"review":"A little bulky, but excellent pickup on sound . Definitely what I was hoping for. Hopefully will last 30 years like my last pair of headphones did!!"}
{"review":"These work very well and have a long cable which I find helpful. This product is priced right and I use it whenever I want the sound experience that only headphones can give."}
{"review":"First off I work in radio so I use head (cans) phones all of the time my old pair died needed a new set found these and not only was the price great but the phones themselves are for the price unbelievable. Can't go wrong, now you can pay more but for everyday use, price and product perfect."}
{"review":"I bought these because I was sick of my apple headphones, plus they were broken. I needed a real pair of headphones that would work for listening to music, playing games, and give me clear sound while editing video. I had seen reviews for the ATH-M50s and was really impressed. My budget however was a bit low so I decided to go with the M30s and I can honestly say I was NOT disappointed. These are amazing. The sound is so clear, the bass is great, and it doesn't distort at high volume which I think is nice. If you want great sounding, all purpose headphones at this price range, then these are the ones to get. I also love the look. They have a very simple, all black look that is very sharp. The padding is great, the only thing is that my ears must be huge because if I wear these too long my ears start to hurt a little as if there isn't enough room. This is strange because up until that point they are very comfortable and it might just be a problem with big headphones in general. All in all these are, in my opinion, the best headphones in this price range and I would recommend them to anyone on a budget looking for a great pair of headphones."}
{"review":"Great headphones.  CONS - cord is too long and I wish it had an inline volume adjustment control.  It would be a 5\/5 if it had those two changes."}
{"review":"I'm not an audiophile, so I'll do my best to give these a quick review for the normal listener. It should be noted that I am using a Fiio E17 DAC\/amplifier with both sets. I've heard that the M30's do not really require an amplifier, but the M50's do benefit from the extra power.\n\nI recently purchased these headphones and a pair of ATH-M50's. I am really happy with both. Both sets provide a vast improvement over any pair of in ear phones I've ever owned. I'm hearing parts of songs I never knew existed. I would have given these 5 stars if it weren't for the M50's. The M50's have a noticeable increase in quality, but you wouldn't notice unless you were directly comparing the two, one after the other.\n\nOn the other hand, these are well worth the price, and I even find them to be a little more comfortable than the M50's. That may just be due to having a smaller head. It seems like the smallest the M50's will go is just slightly larger than I'd like, while the smallest these go is actually smaller than I need. So keep that in mind if you know you have a small head.\n\nFinally, the increased clamping force and depth of ear cups on the M50's provides better isolation, but because of this, they can become slightly uncomfortable during long sessions.\n\nOverall, both sets are really good. I would recommend either. If you're looking for the absolute best sound between the two, go with the M50's. Otherwise, these are really good, and maybe even a little more comfortable. And definitely more affordable."}
{"review":"I like the sound and feel, they are comfortable.  They do not have a removable cord, so if it breaks, you cant replace it.\n\nOverall very good."}
{"review":"Bought these as a birthday gift for my brother, he is very happy with them. Only drawback, which other reviews' warned of, was the length of the cord!"}
{"review":"Before I go on, I'd like to say that I\"m still using my M30s, because they really are amazing, but I have a serious problem with them that prevents me from enjoying the experience. The sound quality is excellent regardless, and the included 3.5 to quarter inch adapter was a nice touch.\n\nThe problem with the M30s is that they have very shallow over-the-ear pads, and convex driver cups. In plain English, they have no room for my ears to fit inside. This is partly on me, as I have large ears, but even after replacing the pads with thicker alternatives and attempting to stretch the headband to lessen the pressure, I still get headaches within an hour of use. The grinding got to the point where they were actually causing my ear cartilage to calcify, creating these very sensitive hard spots that would stick around for a day or two before I could wear the headphones again.\n\nI can't imagine I'm the only one having this problem. I've never gotten this with cheaper headsets; my cheapo Turtle Beach set had indented cups so my ears weren't pressed against the inside, but I just can't find a safe position with these. I keep using them because at first I thought they would get better with stretching, and then because I had exceeded the return period, but honestly, I'd really like to use them, because the sound is just so much better than anything I've owned before."}
{"review":"I wish vendors advertised headphones by hat size. I have a big head and finding comfortable, durable headphones is a challenge; buying headphones that are too small feels like sticking your head in a vice. These are very comfortable, have good sound, and are well enough made that I'm not worried about breaking them through normal usage."}
{"review":"Good sound (movies & music from laptop) and  excellent isolation.\nWire way too long but the main problem is the jack (even with the minimum stress comes off)"}
{"review":"I got these for my gaming desktop, and for listening to music. They are amazing, heck if you don't tell people how cheap they are most think these are top line headphones"}
{"review":"The Audio Technica ATH-M30 are excellent headphones. The sound quality is good and the construction is also excellent. For the price, these headphones truly deliver and you can't go wrong with them."}
{"review":"Oh my science, these are the best headphones I've ever used, EVER, IN MY WHOLE LIFE. So glad I didn't waste money on $100+ headphones. The bass on these is ah-mazeballs."}
{"review":"First time buying such \"expensive\" headphone and I am totally in love with them. Very nice noise cancellation, you think that you \"belong\" in your own music world!\n+1 by me."}
{"review":"After 2 weeks of use. my find verdict is average. Sound is OK. And quite comfortable. But it will not be able to produce sounds from a $200.00 pair."}
{"review":"I prefer a closed back because this style is much more comfortable to wear.  The sound is clear and very acceptable.  Good quality and value for the price."}
{"review":"The quality of these cans is alright. The bass response leaves alot to be desired, and the highs are a bit weak. I own a pair of Sony MDR-V6 headphones and there is no comparison between the two, but, for the money, the ATH-30 cans perform realitivly well. I will use them as a backup set for my multi-track recorder."}
{"review":"So far so good, decent audio, fantastic price. Have not encountered any of the issues mentioned by other users, and been using them for a month or so."}
{"review":"I picked these up on sale to replace my worn-out Grado headphones. Although they aren't as loud, these are awesome headphones. They are solid and well designed."}
{"review":"I got these to replace a pair of Skull Candy headphones that had started to wear out. The price was right for these, and they haven't disappointed.\nI'm not an audiophile so I can't speak to the ranges and all of that. But, these are comfortable to wear and I think the sound is pretty good.\nDefinitely a good choice for the money."}
{"review":"I'm just a regular gal who likes to listen to music without hearing a lot of background noise.  These fit the bill for me.  I only wish they came in different colors."}
{"review":"I love these headphones. They completely surpass my expectations of when i bought this headphone. Its definitely good for the price it has and is highly recommendable. with little more research i discovered that many people on forums and on Youtube recommend this product and the manufacture (Audio-Technica) as well. It was definitely a great buy."}
{"review":"Without getting into the intricacies of high quality audio headphones, I'll just say these are a great-sounding set that will likely satisfy your musical thirst. You're probably not going to find a set of headphones at a higher quality for this price. They're not flashy and they're not endorsed by some well-known rapper, but they definitely get the job done. They're pretty comfortable (I wear them at work almost all day), have a full sound, solid bass and seem to be pretty durable. I've worked in radio off and on and feel these are pretty much on-par for what you'll usually find in the on-air or other studios. Bottom line: If this is in your price range, get them."}
{"review":"I had an Sennheiser HD239.. This headphone has better audio quality, solid bass and GREAT SOUND ISOLATION.\nUsing all day in work, the hp is very comfy."}
{"review":"I got these headphones to monitor my recordings, and so far, so good. The speakers give a flat, uncolored playback of recorded material. I did an A\/B against my friend's powered studio monitors, and I couldn't hear a noticeable difference. The studio monitors cost many times what these headphones cost, so that's a good value for money.\n\nThe over-ear headphones could be a bit more comfortable (hence the 4 star rating). I have to take off the headphones after about an hour because the fit is so snug. Of course, this is a conscious design tradeoff to guard against bleedover. These headphones keep outside noises out, and the sound from the headphones in (my mics don't pick up any playback from the headphones when I'm tracking)."}
{"review":"I have a limited budget for my headphones but a real need for quality. I love these. I have had two before this that were not as good and just as expensive. One broke and one just didn't cancel any sound. These fit great ( I have glasses to accomodate and they are still very comfy), as well as canceling outside noise (playoff games and other loud tv). The sound quality from the headphones is great. Couldn't be happier."}
{"review":"I bought these headphones along with the Audio-Tech mic.....If you need noise canceling headphones these are the ones to purchase!...The price is great as well!\n\nAtlanta"}
{"review":"Bought these in July 2012 for my elderly mom so she could hear the TV above the household noise of teens and relatives where she resides. Needed an adapter\/extension cord to get it to reach her lounger near the tv in her room. She liked them and used them daily. They shipped in a descent amount of time, were easy for my sister to install and did not require much adjusting.\n\nI'm giving only three stars because by April 2013 (less than 9 months) one earpiece had stopped working. We checked the box and online receipts trying to find a warranty or exchange\/refund information but saw that it had only a 30 day refund policy and no exchanges available. That's a bummer. I would have expected them to work for at least a year, hopefully, longer. I'm researching another set but will definitely look for a better brand this time and make sure a warranty is available."}
{"review":"feel good, sound is nice and not to deep and overall great for the price. im very happy with this ish\nwould recommend to those looking for some nice headphones that aren't overpriced like those awful beats by dre\/monster\/rip-off"}
{"review":"very good sound for this price, use it at work and it cancels ambient noise fairly good.\nmy ears get hot\/go red after maybe an hour thou, not much of a prob, since i need to take it off often (being at work and all)"}
{"review":"it's a cheap price for the large audio jack that i needed for my piano and capable of being used in regular small audio jacks as well. i am by no means knowledgable in music and got it for fun or just starting out. sound quality is good, this entire thing works like a charm."}
{"review":"Great for the price.\n\n* Reasonably comfortable\n  -Don't really breath and push on the head a little. Fine if you take a break every now and then.\n* Got them for 38$...\n* Good volume, base a little weak, good highs and lows, have not heard any sound breaking even up to the max volume\n* One problem i had was the left headphone was slightly louder than the right , easier enough to fix by changing equilibrium and increasing the right by 5 volume points above the left"}
{"review":"These are nice headphones for the price.  Not a ton of power but enough for true sound.  They look great and wear comfortable. They appear to be very durable.  At this price don't hesitate to pick up a pair."}
{"review":"I got these based on the glowing reviews, as I was looking for a pair of headphones to wear while watching TV and gaming at night when the family is asleep.\n\nThe sound is pretty good, and very balanced. They're excellent for dialogue (no more wondering what people are saying because the background explosions are too loud!) and very clear. They're a bit lacking in bass, and would not be my first choice for music. But they're good for the price.\n\nThe cord is 10' long, which is my viewing distance. I wish it was a bit longer, but that's just because I sit farther away from my receiver. Others may feel the cord is too long. It's a good quality, thick cable with a 3.5 mm end which plugs into phones and mp3 players. I use a cheap adapter to make it plug into my receiver.\n\nI have a rather large head, and these cans definitely get uncomfortable after about an hour. They're pretty light, which is nice, but squeeze my head a bit too much.\n\nOverall they feel quite cheap. They're very plasticky, and do not retain their shape once off your head. The cable only attaches to the left ear, so they're imbalanced weight-wise. The ear pads flip over very easily, which makes them kind of a pain to just slip on quickly. And they get hot after about an hour.\n\nThey're great for noise isolation (note - they are NOT noise canceling), as I can barely hear anything else going on around me when I have them on.\n\nOverall they're decent cans for the price. If you need a cheap pair of headphones for watching TV at night, these should be on your short list."}
{"review":"The headphones sound great. The only con I have is the cord, which is maybe 7-9 feet long. It can definitely get in the way at times."}
{"review":"All the notes are well represented and they are comfortable. I don't use headphones much as I prefer my home theater set up but when I have to use these, I am thoroughly impressed. You can't beat the price."}
{"review":"Good headphones for the price range,  but after comparing them to a few other brands around the office, they sound muffled.\n\nI'm pleased with the comfort and length of the cable,  just not blown away by the sound."}
{"review":"These are very comfortable even for long wear. The sound is amazing, I can hear sounds I couldn't hear with other head phones. For example, the song If U Seek Amy by Britteny Spears I can hear glasses clnking at the start that I never heard without these headphones. The only thing I don't like is I miss having volume control on the cord but the amazing sound these have makes up for that."}
{"review":"Sound is good and flat with more bass response than I expected. Far superior to everything else I've tried in this price range. The downside is the pressure hurts my ears. After a 5 hour session, it was difficult to sleep as my ears were sore. Still sore the next day. I've tried stretching them overnight without luck."}
{"review":"I assume you are buying these for music.\nIf so, pass on these, especially if you do hip hop.\nYou can barely hear all the instruments in the beat.\nI would rather use my ear buds."}
{"review":"For 40 dollars CNet rated in Top10 headphones you can get, this was definately an awesome deal.  I bought two pairs and they sound terrific.  The only bad part is, that I wish they were a bit louder.."}
{"review":"I think I figured out that I have extremely sensitive ears because many headphones hurt my ears from minimal usage.\n\nI heard good things about this not-so-expensive pair of headphones, so I wanted to try it out.\n\nFirst of all sound-wise, these are good. Probably on par or better than my JVC RX900s.\n\nOn to the comfortability: I rated it 2 stars because they are extremely uncomfortable for me.\n\nSome people say  they are comfortable, but for my 'sensitive' ears - they don't cut it. I can't wear them for 10 minutes without it really hurting my ears and having to remove them completely.\n\nI was extremely dissatisfied with them and returned them less than a week later.\n\nI bought another pair of JVC HA-RX 900's (my last pair's left ear died) and I'm loving them. They [RX900] are a great budget pair of headphones which completely cover my ear, unlike the M30s which were just sitting on my ear.\n\nIf you have sensitive ears, I would not recommend the M30s. If you don't have a problem with sensitivity, give them a try - you might like them."}
{"review":"These are nicely constructed, very good at cutting out outside noise, and sound excellent. I can put them on and shut out nearly everything else in the room. It works well for me for listening to and recording music, playing games, watching movies, etc. The cord is nicely constructed with an anti-fraying spring on the end and includes an adapter for 1\/4th inch stereo that screws in securely."}
{"review":"especially for people like me who's ear protrude out; this headset is an absolute no. the sound quality is pretty good but the discomfort to the ear is a lot. my ears started aching within 30 minutes and attempts to stretch the headset didn't help. unfortunately, i had to return this :("}
{"review":"My work recently gave me the opportunity to test drive a couple of higher-end (a.k.a. more expensive) headphones and many of them didn't sound as good as these.\n\nThe sound to price ratio is great."}
{"review":"these are the best headphones you can buy for the price. I use them at work and also on the plane when I travel. I love how clean and crisp the sound is and how it keeps noise in and also blocks a lot of environment noise. Would most-def recommend these bad boys."}
{"review":"After reading the reviews, I was expecting a quality product for the $43 I spent on these headphones.  I surely was not disappointed.  I am by no means an audiophile, but love my music and cant stand listening to music on the shoddy apple earbuds.  To my novice ear, all aspects of the sound stand out, especially the clarity between sounds...none of that 'blended' noise that you get with cheap products where you can hear the song but cant appreciate the color of different instruments.  The clarity of these headphones provides an almost concert-like quality.  If this is your price range, I would be surprised if you can find a better product."}
{"review":"I bought this headphone mainly due to its long wire and decent build quality.\nWhen comparing with my grado SR60 (the lower end of grado products), it lags far behind. All music sound very dull.\nThe sound isolation could be better.\nThe plug is excellent in quality.\nIt is very kids friendly."}
{"review":"I purchased these for work where I have to listen to phone calls our reps take all day.  We bought two pair and with both pairs, when using the noise cancelling feature there was distortion and feedback and static. We are returning both pair and I'm purchasing another brand."}
{"review":"It should have it's own volume control, but I think it is a good product.\nI wood still recommend this to someone else if asked."}
{"review":"I bought this headphone set primarily for use while traveling, on airplanes.  They really aren't noise cancelling, but they muffle the noise well, have good sound, and are comfortable."}
{"review":"I usually have to practice later at night and love this set of hp's they sound very clear and make my late night practice sessions much more pleasant for the others in my home."}
{"review":"I have worn these for a couple of days now.  I can honestly say that they are the best headphones I have ever had.  You should know that I have never paid more than $25 for a set though.  :)\n\nThese fit perfectly, sound great and no matter how hard I try, I can't distort the sound, so kudos are due there also.\n\nI would buy them again, and I may have to.  The reason for me giving 4 stars instead of 5;  The line in comes into the left can only.  This I like, so I don't get tangled up all the time like my last set of Koss did, but I should have looked at the picture really closely.  You can do it now, go ahead, I will wait.  See that little feeder wire to the right can?  It is an annoyance.  I realize why it is there, so you can make the head carriage longer for those tall faces out there, but it's a finger grabber, and I am afraid that I might rip it out one day.  Just a subtle design flaw that I feel could have been easily fixed by routing a service loop interior to the design of the headphone instead of externally.  Just a point of failure that could have been avoided.\n\nI'll see how it works out in the long run.  If something happens, I will update this review.  If not, I may come back and bump it up to a 5 star review.  Time will tell."}
{"review":"These are very nice, amazingly rich sound, good outside sound suppression, and pretty comfortable all things considered. I'm not an audiophile, nor, do I usually buy headphones (I prefer speakers) but since I am sharing an office now the purchase was a necessity. They have worked extremely well thus far and the cord is quite long which is awesome I can walk around the office and not get yanked back by the length. Compared to a lot of other headphones I've seen and compared on here for less than 40$ I'd buy them again."}
{"review":"this headset is very good at blocking outside noise while listening to music or my voice over recordings before i submit them. very good sound quality."}
{"review":"They're comfortable for a while, but after a few hours my ears start to hurt and I take them off. I don't think there's a head size problem with these - the headphones stretch pretty far, big enough for all sized heads. I think the ear pain just comes with any set of headphones. We're all spoiled with ear buds these days, we've forgotten what it's like to wear a pair of quality headphones.\n\nI don't use them for recording, just for music at work, but I can tell that they would work great for anything studio-related. The bass is powerful and clean (doesn't rattle or buzz). The plug is metallic and the wire is long and thick, not that tiny, two-wire webbed business that wal-mart sells you."}
{"review":"These headphones are solidly built and quite robust.  They're comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and make great workhorse cans. They're really not much to write home about in the audio quality department.  Solid middle-of-the-road performance.  The highs are a bit crispy for my taste, the bass is full and bordering on \"boomy.\""}
{"review":"Ok I literally got these headphones today. Ive listened to Nas to dubstep to jimi hendrix and these headphones are amazing. It seems like it changes with every genre I try. It's almost like hearing my favorite artist for the first time all over agian. I notice little things in the background that I've never heard before. The only negative is the cord is super long even though i understand because im sure these where originally intended for studio use. But since these are soo nice im only going to use them for home use.  I will update this review in a month or soo for the duribility of these headphones since ive only had them for like 12 hours"}
{"review":"I'm not an audiophile at all so I can only really review these within the context of the type of headphones I normally use (~$25 on\/over ear headphones). These blow away all the headphones I've used in that price range. The bass is prominent without being too punchy (my main complaint with most cheap headphones - the bass is either overbearing or nonexistent).These sounded good on my old iPod Shuffle. On my computer with integrated audio (Realtek ALC889) the sound was a bit weak. I couldn't get quite enough volume without excessive software pre-amping which introduced a bit of hissing and popping in the treble. Plugging it into my Xonar DG and activating the headphone amp function fixed this. So, if you plan on using these with a computer keep that in mind.\n\nOverall, I'm not sure if I'd be completely satisfied with these if I paid the list price but at 70-75% off these are definitely worth it for a few bucks more if you're used to $25 headphones."}
{"review":"The headphones come out of the box a little tight for my head, but after a little bending they now fit perfectly.  Very deep, natural sounding base.  Significant reduction in outside noise (can't hear yourself talk)\n\nAll in all very good, recommended."}
{"review":"I was looking for some headphones that I could use while plying my guitar as well as listening to my iPod . Well , these headphones are great ! They are comfortable , and the sound is fantastic ! I am very satisfied and feel I got my money's worth ."}
{"review":"The sound is very clear.  They are not noise cancelling, but once you have them on you don't hear any outside noises.  I was impressed by the comfort and light weight of the set.  You can wear them for several hours before they start to get uncomfortable. Great set; I'm very happy with this purchase."}
{"review":"The quality of the headphones is great without huge price you see for others out their. If you intend on using them while traveling they're a bit bulky but if that's not a issue then you won't be disappointed. The audio quality is excellent and their very comfortable."}
{"review":"I did quite a bit of research before deciding to go with this particular set of headphones.  I primarily use them for professional video editing and for the occasional gaming.  And they have been performing wonderfully for the past two months now.  The sound is full and clear and  for the money, it would be a challenge to find a better  set of headphones.  The only drawback is the comfort.  When I first got them, there were several pressure points on my ears.  But either the headphones or my head have seemed to adjust enough to not notice it anymore!"}
{"review":"The quality is good for cheap headphones. Got what I paid for and I am happy.\n\nIt is very comfortable and looks like it would last for a long time.\n\nThe wire is also very loooooooong"}
{"review":"These headphones are fantastic and they do indeed have some great passive noise canceling. They have nice crisp sound and have some great bass for those out there looking for that.\n\nFor the price, these headphones are very much worth it. I would definitely recommend them."}
{"review":"These are great sounding headphones. No color just a flat 20-20k response. Because of the price I picked up two pair and am glad i did. Can't miss with these for a small studio application."}
{"review":"First off, I am no audiophile. What I enjoy the most about the ATH-m30 is their comfort. Easely the most comfortable cans I ever owned. I found the quality of the sound much to my liking. It sounds true and equal. No over-emphasis on bass or anything. Considering that i paid around 55$ with shipping (with a huge discount), I am most pleased with this purchace. They also look better than on the picture. Some would say plain, but I would answer they look like they sound : clean, honest and true with no fluff.\n\nTbh though, I almost gave four stars to the ATH-m30 because I also own a set of meelectronics ht-21. Those costed me around the same price than the ATH-M30 with shipping and without a discount...and they sound better. Granted, the ht-21 have absolutely amazing sound for the price, but not much more (very uncomfortable)."}
{"review":"Been on a long quest to find the best sounding headphones I can afford. This is my 4th pair in the last 2 months or so. They sound absolutely delicious. The greatest buy ever at $40."}
{"review":"I got these for my girlfriend because she wanted a (more) comfortable\/professional pair like mine. These are not as great as the more expensive Audio - Technica headphones I've owned but for the price, I seriously doubt you will find a better pair! Amazing sound quality, comfortable, and relatively little sound bleed. 100% satisfied. Everything I expected?"}
{"review":"Got a great deal on amazon.  They can be worn for ages with no problems, nice long cable,  Not the same as wearing microsoft or logitec computer headsets, but der...  It looks heavy but you never notice and the clarity is great"}
{"review":"Haven had as many stereo headsets as I have in 35 years, these are clearly the best bang for the buck. I took my 30's to a good audiophile store. They let me try the AT-40 and 50 series. There may be a difference but not enough for me to notice... lets just say the high end differences do not constitute $100 more. Get the 30's, they rock and a bargain."}
{"review":"After 3 days of lots of use\nThe sound quality is quite good for a pair of 30 dollar headphones. Very precise. Bass is strong, full, and precise, mid and high range sounds are pretty accurate and every little sound in the music is clearly heard. Isolation is not very good, however, these headphones are not made to isolate you from outside noise.\nThe only bad thing about these headphones: the ear cups are a little small, not a problem, but they do make your ears very warm after prolonged use. Overall, very good for the price.\nEDIT: in comparison to the Sony MDR-NC7 on-ear headphones that I own, they are not great at noise-cancellation. The Sony MDR-NC7s are better at noise-cancellation, but have less sound quality by a lot.\nI also own skullcandy hesh headphones, which are less cramping and hot around the ears, but the music is not as clear cut as coming from the ATH-M30s. The bass on the skullcandy heshs is stronger by a little but, again, not as clear and precise as the ATH-M30s."}
{"review":"I have had these head phone for about 10 days. They are light weight and very comfortable. They do not sound as good as my more expensive A.T.'s , but really sound good for what i paid. Very happy with my purchase."}
{"review":"Having both the \"small\" and \"large\" headphone jack adapter makes this a great value.  You will not get a better sounding, versatile product for under $50."}
{"review":"I got these after the cheap, un-gluable headband snapped on my (otherwise quite nice) noise-cancelling Bose headphones.  Believe me, I *tried* to glue it back, then awkwardly duct-tape it, then...\n\nThese are comfortable, they are made of heavier materials and it's all beautifully assembled.  The large padded earpieces do a better job at cancelling noise than the cheaper earpieces and electronics could do anyway.  The headband is more comfortable and sturdier.  Even the cable is reassuringly solid yet nicely flexible.  This is clearly an object of quality."}
{"review":"I got these for an electronic drum kit.  They work great.  Given the low price, I was skeptical, but they are perfect for what I was looking for."}
{"review":"Good value. I don't have to listen to the war movies my husband likes to watch, they are big enough to cover the whole ear"}
{"review":"These have great sound quality.  The ear pieces fit very snugly and the cushions are nice and comfortable on the ears.  Blocks a good amount of ambient noise as well.  The cord is nice and long.  These have a good weight to them - not flimsy.  Looks like they will hold up for a while.  Really impressed with the value, and would recommend to anyone."}
{"review":"Bummer, my first flight with these and as soon as my leg hits the part that goes inside the jack it breaks right off. Now, useless."}
{"review":"I have a studio and I needed a second pair of headphones.  I saw these and they had decent reviews so I purchased them thinking they would be so-so considering the price.  I can't say enough about these headphones. I have a pair of $70 sennheisers, and these are just as good if not better! Super comfortable, super durable, and they sound superb.  For the price, these are a great buy, hands down.  No complaints.\n\nBuy these headphones.  They were far better than what I was expecting."}
{"review":"While I am not an audiophile nor a studio engineer or recording musician, I can tell the difference when bass is too strong or the high-end is screeching too much. These ATH-M30 headphones provide great clarity and are perfect for my needs.\n\nI haven't used headphones in many years, relying primarily on ear buds because they were \"more convenient\" when I needed them. However, I had never found ear buds that I was truly happy with. The closest has been the&nbsp;&nbsp;which provide pretty good quality sound for what they are but they are still inside my ear. Thus my quest began to find headphones that did not cost a fortune, produce good sound, and are comfortable for long periods of time. I read a lot of reviews and queried my friends. I ended up with these AudiTechnica cans and have not looked back.\n\nThe sound quality is very good. They are certainly not as good as the Bose headphones my friend owns but they are (at the price I paid) a fraction of the cost and he needs the quality that Bose delivers. I simply need something that sounds good, providing a good balance between bass, and the mid- and high-range, does not distort the sound if I want to crank it up a bit, and is comfortable. These do fit that bill. I must say that I hardly feel that I am wearing these due to their light weight and the nearly perfect fit over my ears. In addition the noise cancelling works very well.\n\nMy primary uses are with my: Lenovo G570 laptop when traveling or away from home;&nbsp;&nbsp;when traveling; and,&nbsp;&nbsp;while at home working or editing photos. I do on occasion use these with my TV. I have a few hundred of my favorite tunes loaded on my computers and Kindle and the music covers every genre performed.\n\nThe cans work extremely well with my TV, laptop and pc, not as well with my Kindle, but passable. And really the only time I use them with my Kindle is during a flight. The sound (and noise cancelling) work well while in the air. While they do not fold up like some others do they easily fit in my backpack and I simply keep the cord wound and secured.\n\nI appreciate that there is only one cord going into the phones on one side and the fact that they are thick. These were a couple of other key points that assisted my final purchase decision. There were many reviews about headphones where the cords were thin and the owners ended up trashing them due to damage.\n\nWould I have paid the $100+ MSRP? I doubt it. Though I am not sure what I would have ended up with were these not priced below $50. Glad I don't have to worry about that.\n\nThus, to sum it up, I definitely recommend these for anyone who wants a quality made comfortable product but who does not want to spend a small fortune on cans that will provide, in most cases, a good consistent sound quality across the boards, i.e., for any genre of music. Giving them 4 stars because I have heard my friend's Bose which are definitely 5 star."}
{"review":"So I don't know all of the technical terms on how great these are, up until I got them I was the kind of guy who was ok with $5 cheapo headphones. No joke though after getting these I may never go back to another set of headphones again.\n\nThe simplest way I can put it is that when I use these headphones I hear things I swear aren't there when I use my other set. They are also so comfortable that after a while I forget that I am wearing them to begin with. I just spent about four hours playing Skyrim and I honestly feel like they added something significant to the experience. The biggest thing was that the world felt more alive. When using standard headphones I could hear the sounds of nature around me, but it wasn't like I was there, everything was somewhat dull. The sound from these headphones really came to life though, I felt like I was listening to a waterfall, or listening to the sounds of a forest instead of a recording of that sound.\n\nBottom line if you are looking for headphones that are cheap but really good quality these are probably a good bet. I got them while they were on sale and honestly I think even at full price they are a bit of a steal."}
{"review":"My ears hurt after having these on for 20 minutes. They need to make the ear pads larger. Beyond that, the sound quality is good for the price."}
{"review":"I received these the next day! Great sound quality and so far I love them! They seem just as good as those pricey name brand ones but with the sale price these are a much better value!  They are very comfortable and sturdy.  They don't block out all background noises, but I don't turn the volume up very loud, and as a mom, I do still need to have some awareness of what's going on in the background.  They drowned out enough that background noise isn't a distraction and so these are good enough for me."}
{"review":"Just a disclaimer to start, I am not by any means a music\/sound\/headphones professional but I do enjoy music and I listen to it a lot at my desktop computer. On to the review!\n\n+ Very comfortable!\nThe ear pieces are spring loaded so when they are put on it feels like a custom fit. They are nice and large with cushion surrounding the ear pieces. The head band is made of a soft leathery material that you do not notice while wearing them.\n\n+ Extremely sturdy\nThe headphones have an overall sturdy feel to them. They seem very well put together and made out of high quality material. The cord is very long and thick and is only attached to one side of the ear piece. The part of the headphone that blew me away was the connector. They are surrounded by a spring where it connects to the aux port which protects it from damage. This place is where the \"one side of the headphones does not work\" problem usually arises from, genius in my opinion.\n\n+ Great sound quality\nI've owned just a few headphones that I've used for long periods of times and they were all budget (~$30) headphones. The sound quality of these guys are about the same. They also don't leak music very much and does a great job of isolating outside noise."}
{"review":"My girlfriend had a nice pair of Bose noise canceling headphones which broke recently. She spends a lot of time editing videos and needs to hear everything going on. Being after Christmas and her birthday, I did not want to throw down $200+ on head phones, so I got her these as a temporary fix. She loves them. Granted they are not as clean and not as comfortable (extended wear) as her Bose or my Sennheisers, they are still awesome for the price!!"}
{"review":"These headphones do a great job in presenting music clearly and with a nice frequency response across the board. I like them and the are an excellent replacement for some older headphones I had in my studio.\n\nIf there is any negative that I can find about these headphones is that after an hour or so of use, the ear pads felt uncomfortable on my ears. But they may just not be adjusted correctly. My older AKGs do not have that problem and I use them as reference to all headphones for comfort because they have always felt comfortable when using for extended sessions."}
{"review":"After two months of light use, the left side of the headphones quit working.  Audio-Technica's warranty requires owners to pay for shipping on warranty repairs, which hardly makes it worthwhile, considering the price of the headphones.  So, you have a product that is basically crap, and the prospect of any kind of meaningful service past Amazon's window for returns is highly dubious.  I would recommend buying a different product."}
{"review":"I listen to meditation tapes and some include alpha-producing sounds. Also I want to block out environmental noise when I'm meditating. These work with all my computers. Also my boom box. There's an extra adjustment piece for a larger earphone outlet.\nVery comfortable. Very clear. If I were recording music I might want something more high end and expensive..... but again: at this price I looked a long time and found nothing better!"}
{"review":"The ATH-M30 was marked-down to $37, and was a fair price.  I would not have paid the full price, because the soft ear parts seem like they would rip easily, and the shielded wires on both sides could easily get snagged."}
{"review":"I'm not someone who spends a lot on this sort of thing, but I read a lot of reviews and chose this product thoughtfully. The sound is great for me. I use it on my computer, on my piano (to spare my family) and on my tablets to watch movies. Nice full\/rich sound. Very comfortable (I have a small head), put them on right out of the box, fit perfectly. No complaints at all."}
{"review":"I am looking for a headphone to use in the office.\n\nSo, I am looking for something\n* Not expensive, since I am using the default sound card from the computers.\n* Comfortable (not to hurt my ears after 1 hour) for hours of using.\n* Light weight.\n* Great sound quality.\n* Not super sounds proof.  I need to be aware that if someone is talking to me, etc.\n\nAfter 2 months of use:\n* This head has great built-quality.\n* Very comfortable and reasonable light weight for its size.\n* The sound quality is great.  I have to use my laptop (not the desktop).  My desktops sound card is so bad.  I could not realize that from my old headphone (Sennheiser eH250).\n* However, the bass is solid and weak.  Just ordered a new desktop and I hope it will have a better sound card with equalizer.  My current desktop is 3 years old.\n\nIn conclusion, it is very good buy, but it may require a better source (for the bass)."}
{"review":"Ultimately, I am satisfied with my purchase of these, I ended up buying them locally for a few dollars more because I didn't want to wait for shipping.\n\nI was looking for a good set to use when it was too late to use my monitors, and something for general use as well.\nMy current budget only allowed for about 100$ to be spent on headphones.\n\nThe reviews of these are a little bit exaggerated to be perfectly honest.\nYes, they have a good sound. Yes they have good lows, mids, and highs.\nFor 40$ I feel that they are a good buy with good sound quality.\n\nI only gave them three stars because the reviews of these are completely blown out of proportion.\nThings being said like \"these monitors sound like something costing 4 times as much\"\nThe way they're spoken of, makes one think that they sound ALOT better than what they are, which is a low end headphone.\n\nIndeed, they are a good sounding 40$ headphone, and will sound better than your average off the shelf at best buy 30-40$ headset.\nDO NOT expect them to sound like real Professional Studio Monitors, which they are marketed as.\nThey just do not have the detail, super smooth lows, crystal clear highs that one would expect from proper monitors.\n\nTheyre low end headphones. Don't forget that. Possibly the best low end set on the market, but nothing more than that.\nI honestly would have stretched my budget a bit and picked up something a little better sounding.\nFor what I paid though, I can't complain. The reviews are just highly highly exaggerated."}
{"review":"Bought them for my cousin. He cannot stop raving about the clarity and bass. Of course, it is all within the context of price -- these cannot compete with $500 heaphones -- but they can compete with $150 ones, I bet. Will consider getting a pair for myself, actually."}
{"review":"I am by no means an audiophile (not even sure I just spelled that correctly), but I do enjoy these headphones.  I watch shows and movies mostly on my ipad and found these to be comfortable and the sound very good.  Blocks out ambient noise very well."}
{"review":"I needed affordable closed back headphones for tracking in my project studio. What I got was detailed full sounding cans that are comfortable to wear and have tight bass, present mids and crisp highs. I wouldn't go so far as to recommend mixing on these but they're great for listening to music and perhaps checking a mix. They aren't flat but they're not that far from it and the detail is the thing that really impresses me. I hear new things on tracks which I've listened to on lesser similar priced (if not more expensive) headphones. These really are bang for buck. Nice long cable too! The gold connectors with screw on 1\/4\" adaptor is a nice pro touch too, it all seems very top quality and long lasting. All this for such a cheap set of cans!"}
{"review":"I have a pair of Bose QC Headphones and I am not going to say these are as good but for a cheap pair of headphones these are great!  I am really enjoying what I hear from these."}
{"review":"My husband bought a pair of these headphones to use for gaming and he loves them. We bought a second pair for when he eventually wears out the first pair. This was a really great price for the quality of headphones."}
{"review":"Simple review.\n\nPros:\n Feels solid overall.\n\n Nice bass.\n\n I like the long cable, because I'm using these for home, not for mobile.\n\nCons:\n I'd recommend doing some slight equalizer tuning (if you have a compatible sound card\/program), namely to boost the bass ever so slightly relative to the mid and high range. Might also consider slightly lowering the very top end. It can be a little harsh.\n\n We'll see how the earphone padding holds up. It's the only part that seems flimsy.\n\n I don't consider myself as having a \"big\" head. I'd say it's probably normal or large-normal. The headphones do feel a little \"strong\" on the ears. This is partially exacerbated by the fact that I wear glasses--I always forget how uncomfortable circumaural headphones can be with glasses. This is not a fault of the headphones, but I'm throwing out that warning if you're like me and switching back to over-ear for the first time in a long time.\n\n Similar to my previous point, I had the expectation that the pads would fit completely around my ears. Maybe that was an bad expectation. It's again not the fault of the headphones, but they tend to lay on my ears more than around them. I'd also say my ears are \"normal\" sized.\n\nSummary:\n Overall, good headphones, especially for the price. Make sure they are what you want. Most of the cons I listed are the fault of my ignorance of the product, not the product itself. 4 stars because I reserve 5 for REALLY good products."}
{"review":"Great sound. Very comfortable. Good quality. Really love it - wear them when I only want to hear music from PC - Paired with Syba SD-CM-UAUD Usb Stereo Audio Adapter."}
{"review":"I bought these for the kid next door for mowing my yard. He loves them. He was going to get Beats but likes these better."}
{"review":"Product is as described, the cord is nice and long. The headphones suit my purpose extremely well. I would definitely reccomend this headphone for anyone looking for a great quality cheap headphone. I don't know that I would say professional as far as use, but I use them to listen to music and they work great.\n\nThe bass is just right, the treble has no issues. Very comfortable. I don't see them breaking too easily or falling apart."}
{"review":"A very fine set of headphones, comfortable and not intrusive like earbuds, which I hate.  Fine for listening to music, watching videos on the internet or general use."}
{"review":"the sound good. it's comfortable for my ears and the sound is good. my Sony headphones are still better but this is good for the price."}
{"review":"Wanted to love these but they're just not that comfortable, especially for extended periods of use. I know nothing about audio quality but they do sound pretty good."}
{"review":"I like over the ear head phones and these are a pretty good pair.  The only draw back is it gets rather warm around the ears with extended wear.  I use them at work and they help to cancel other background noise.  Good buy."}
{"review":"I got this headphone and using this for more than 6 months, it is a pretty good buy. The sound quality is balanced and good."}
{"review":"The wire inlet to the left ear is so poorly designed\/manufactured, any movement at all, even turning your head, will cause an awful plastic-creak. After a while it is hard to not fixate on this little annoyance. I taped it so the inlet fits the grommet better. . . Hope this works or they are going back.\n\nQuite disappointed I believed the good reviews on here. My free headphones I got with a $17 logitech webcam put these to shame."}
{"review":"Had it for a few days.  For the price, cannot be beat.  I love my Koss portapro better but it broke after only a short while.  The M30 is really comfortable for me.  Really like the sound on it while using all of my different media players.  So far so good."}
{"review":"These headphones are a great pair for temporary use, i.e. vacation. They are fairly inexpensive so if you lose them, you won't be out of a lot of money.\n\nOnly downside is they could have more bass."}
{"review":"Only complaint I'd have for this pair of headphones is that when I remove them they flip a bit too easily, but this isn't a problem as it seems the plastic is sturdy enough.  The sound quality is good and it blocks out my co-workers' chatter well enough at work in the office."}
{"review":"The sound on these is outstanding they are really clear and were easy better then the one i had before.\nI recorded with them and they where very much what i expected from the Audio Techina brand .\nAll their product are high quality. i would recomand this to anyone they work great .\nand you get a free one year warrenty .."}
{"review":"I have had these headphones for less than a month and have already replaced them once. The initial pair worked for 15 minutes and the right side went out. I was hoping it was my work computer's sound card because they would replace that. I took them home and they worked! For five minutes. The right side went out again. I will hand it to amazon, it was a very easy return, no extra money involved. I have the second pair they sent me. They still work great after three days with 4-5 hours of use each day but after reading other reviews my fingers are crossed that they will continue to do so. The sound is amazing for headphones less than 50 bucks. Deep rich bass, crisp highs. I have listened to every genre imaginable to test the sound and I am impressed. I hope the price these are currently being offered for ($38) is not indicative of how long they will last but for that price, I think its worth the risk. The risk is the only reason I gave these three stars, otherwise, Easy five for sound quality."}
{"review":"Very comfortable, good sound blocking for use on airplane; I also use to watch TV to be sure to catch all the dialog or when others in the house are sleeping.  Very sturdy, well-made.  Sound is very good as well.  The cord is nice and long for various uses.  I like that the cord only attaches to one side, so that there is no cord under the throat."}
{"review":"work just fine--good quality--the spring at the jack to keep the cord from bending too sharply is a nice touch\ncord is nice and long so you can move around some while listening\nI bought two pair and they seemed identical - so quality variation does not seem to be an issue\nI disagree with the review which said they were too small- they seem ok in that regard, but the spring load of the headband is a bit stiff which means they press hard on your ears-- ok for an hour or so, but then you need a break"}
{"review":"One of the best headphones i ever had i just got em' 3 days ago and id been editing my songs and sounds really fantastic it gives you the best quality Guarantee.\n\n-Killa' Flow*"}
{"review":"These headphones came in their box nicely wrapped, new, everything. They feel and look great, with a really long power cord.\n\nWhen I plugged them in and listened to some music I was amazed, best headphones I think I've ever had. The bass is nice, loud, and clear. Good sounding midrange and nice treble too!\n\nOnly complaint is the super-long 11 foot cord, I don't need it most times so I've tied it up with a twist tie.\n\nBut yeah, if you decide to get these I wouldn't blame you!"}
{"review":"Good fast delivery. Great quality, very long cable which is preferred for what we use it for.  Couldn't have asked for better for the price"}
{"review":"Amazing sound. I've had them for almost a year now and they are incredibly durable and block out some outside noise. Overall a great purchase and definitely recommended."}
{"review":"I'd wanted a headset for the gym which would cut out ambient noises and provide decent listening for podcasts (so nothing requiring wide dynamic range).  Headset is comfortable and stays put on your head, but ambient sounds are not blocked and fidelity is just so-so (comparable to sets of half the price).  So I took advantage of Amazon's return policy and sent them back."}
{"review":"These headphones are great! I use them in my office, I have many loud people around me and wearing these listening to music completely blocks having to listen to those around me on the phone or just talking which can be a huge distraction. I highly recommend these headphones"}
{"review":"Well i wanted to buy good headphone for normal home usage. It's amazing but the problem it hurts my left ear, i don't know but it's good headphones only for home. The cord is tall but deal with it ;)"}
{"review":"I use these with a Peavey Vyper 30 amplifier and guitar, and the sound is great. Have only had them several months, so only time will tell how well they will stand up. So far I am very pleased."}
{"review":"First off, I am writing this review after about 1 or 2 years of owning these headphones\nSecond, if you want a small summary of this review, look at the bottom\nI did not buy these headphones on amazon but rather on ebay (got it for cheaper and used to be around $50)\nThe reason it was cheap because the headphones were used, adding another 6 months to a year of ownership\n\nOverall, I am impressed with these headphones and I still own it to this day\nWhen I was looking for headphones, I wanted one where it would be fully durable and comfortable\nAt the same time, I wanted one that was cheap and affordable without overspending on a pair of beats or something\n\nHere are my personal ratings out of a 10:\nDurability 10\/10\nComfort 8\/10\nDesign 9\/10\nSound 9\/10\n\nOverall is 9\/10\n\n-DURABILITY:\nIf I could describe the durability of this headphone, it would be: BEAST\nThis headphone is really durable... I probably trampled on the wire a few thousand times with my rolling chair\nAlso, I stretched this headphone another few thousand times and still haven't broke yet\nThe metal frame allows me to stretch it really outward, almost A FEET worth of head space!!!\nI also slammed the headphone on my table a couple hundred times and it still works (maybe not slammed, but kinda dropped it on my table)\nAnd the cable head connecting to the aux is all metal with a small metal coil making it nearly impossible to break\n\n-COMFORT:\nPreviously, I mentioned that I was looking for headphones that felt comfortable\nI learned later, by experience, that this headphone is not really meant for long term use (especially if you have a large head)\nAfter like a few hours, your ears start to hurt if you leave the headphone on for too long\n\nMy solution:\nThe headphone has an adjustable metal frame where you could pull the sides up or down\nAfter experiencing the ear pain, I pulled the sides down so the headphone kinda slouches\nThis fixed my problem of ear pain after long term use\n\n-DESIGN:\nThe design is very modern and sleek\nAlso I like using black colored accessories for my computer setup for some reason\nThe padding and the headband are really comfortable\nA minor issue is that the earmuff tends to wear out after having it for a while, showing the fabric part\nI ripped off the small pieces of what remained\n\n-SOUND:\nI'm not an audiophile, so I don't know anything about highs or lows\nBut the sound quality is very clear and crisp\nI played a few bass songs and it still sounds nice without ruining the music\nOne thing to point it, the headphone is not fully isolated\nIf I had to base the isolation off of percentages, it would be about 60%...\nI normally still kinda hear outside noises, like my sister is talking while I play music\nOf course, you could adjust the volume but I still hear something\n\nOverall, I love this headphone\nIt's cheap, durable, and great quality\nHeres a SMALL SUMMARY of what I like and the minor problems I had:\n\n-Very durable, cheap for its price\n-Sound is clear and crisp, but the headphone is not fully isolated\n-Comfortable, but experienced ear pains from long use until I stretched the headphones out\n-Nice design, but some wear and tear on the headbands"}
{"review":"These M30's can be described in 3 words: Durable. Comfortable. Great-sounding. I would not consider myself an extreme audiophile, but I can tell the differences between various headphones. These sound extremely nice for listening to music- however the sound for games is not as satisfactory (although still great). The cord is really long so it's hard to stuff into your pocket. Additionally, this has only happened to my laptop, but the connector disconnects very easily. However this is probably a problem with my laptop instead of the headphones as they connect solidly on iPods and my guitar amp. The construction is made out of the durable type of plastic and is padded with comfortable padding. One of my concerns is that the covering on the earmuffs will wear away. Overall a great product."}
{"review":"These headphones are of great construction quality and hold the sound in well. The cord is long and durable and they are comfortable to wear, for a short time.\n\nHowever, they do cause me significant ear pain after 4+ hours as their are not large enough to encompass my ears. I don't think I have particularly large ears, but I can't wear this all day at work due to the ear pain from the pressure.\n\nFor the price, they are a great deal."}
{"review":"Just received these headphones today and love them already. As soon as I got them I plugged them into my laptop and went to youtube to check out some music. I could instantly tell how much better these are but that's obvious compared to my cheap earbuds, These are my first good quality headphones and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. After one song I was extremely happy with the quality and volume, then I realized I had my laptop turned down. So, I turned it all the way up and that's when my body rumbled. They're comfortable to wear, and I have glasses too. For the price I don't think you can find a pair better. The only con I see is that with the volume all the way up other people will be able to hear what you're listening to, but you don't really need it that high up anyway. Its a great buy if you're looking to get your first quality headphones, I had to get them for my sound design class. So, buy them, you won't regret it."}
{"review":"I recently bought these headphones and they sound GREAT for the price.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It is very comfortable and durable.  The only con is that the cord is very long.  You will have to wrap it up w\/ a rubber band."}
{"review":"These headphones have a great sound with plenty of base. There is plenty of padding around the ear piece for extended listening. The cable itself is quite long compared to what I am used to so I ended up coiling up part of the cable and putting a bread twistie around it so there wouldn't be so much around my feet. The only thing I wish these headphones had is a volume control. My old ones had that and you can get kind of spoiled. Other than that I feel these headphones are quite nice and with a great price, to me they are a good investment."}
{"review":"Offers good value for the money. These headphones are certainly not for people who need bass. As the name goes they are Monitor headphones. They are very comfortable to wear. Again they don't work really well with laptops, smartphones, mp3 players. You need the real audio systems from pioneer, Marantz , harmon kardon etc."}
{"review":"Really good as an introductory, cheap pair of heaphones... sound feels somewhat muddled and bass isn't great, but still leagues above most offerings even twice the price in your average retail store. Good way to introduce the strengths of isolation to people who don't know about it.\n\nI feel the Sennheiser HD 202 edges this out in sound quality and portability, though this has a more comfortable frame.\n\nIdle peeve: the 3.5mm connector's base being flat makes it difficult to connect to a lot of female plugs all the way correctly.\n\nAll in all, this is a great headset with a few minor gripes. Definitely worth it for the price."}
{"review":"I feel these are quite comparable to the Sony mdr7506's that seem to be a standard in many studios these days. For about half the price, these are a great set of cans, especially if you need several pair that disrespectful musicians may end up throwing on the floor and possibly breaking anyway. I actually prefer the sound of these to the Sennheiser HD 280's as well for quite a bit less money. Recommended."}
{"review":"After seeing the high quality of these headphones upon arrival, immediately ordered a second pair for my wife.  They're comfortable, the over-ear space is nice and large which is great for my big ears.  I paid 59.99 at a big box wholesale store recently for a pair that actually required batteries, on a wired headset!  My experience with this pair has been the exact opposite, 0 problems, nothing but more enjoyable sound with less background noise."}
{"review":"The headphones sound great for the money. They do sweat on the ears but even ear buds do that. I have not had any problems with durability. I personally wish that the cord was a little shorter. Your music will be heard by others."}
{"review":"For the price I'm not sure you'll find a pair of over-the-ear, closed-back headphones that sound any better.  I can wear them for a couple of hours without them getting uncomfortable but everyone will be different on that.  With a high quality mp3 or a FLAC file these things can pump out some really beautiful sound."}
{"review":"Great dynamic range of sound. Well constructed, professional grade headphones for most any application you can think of including your mp3 player of choice if that is how you choose to use them."}
{"review":"I have had and used this set of headphones for just over 2 weeks now.  I'm now headphones expert and I'm not as well as informed as an audiophile would be.  This is also my first set of \"higher\" end headphones I've had in a long time.  My primary use is for music and gaming.\n\nSo far I would say these headphones are great.  Sound is clear and crisp from the low end to the high end.  However, the bass might a little soft for some.  If you want to feel the bass and not just hear it, this might not be the best set.  I bought this head set knowing it wouldn't be bumping the bass even though I prefer those kinds of headphones.  The chord length is quite long and pretty sturdy. I sometimes yank on the chord as I put on and take off my headphones & this gives me assurance that I won't accidentally rip off the chord.  Lastly, I feel that there could have been a little more padding.  It's not the most comfortable set of headphones I've worn, but it certainly isn't the worst  i just can't really use it for long periods of time since I have a somewhat big head.  I give it 5 stars for the audio quality given the price, but the light padding on this set dropped it to 4 for me.  I like my comfort in home headphones since I would like to use these for extended periods of time.\n\nOverall\nPros:\n-crisp & clear mids & highs\n-pretty sturdy\n- fairly light in weight\n-long chord for that extra move room\n-excellent price for the overall audio quality\nCons:\n- you won't feel the bass (if that is what you're looking for, which make its a potential con), but you'll hear it & it just as crisp as the mids & highs\n-could use a little more padding around the ears"}
{"review":"I don't have a lot of criteria for good headphones and this is only the second good-quality pair I have (the first being the Sony MDR-V6). I had owned cheapo ones before that were uncomfortable, too.\nAnyway, this pair of headpohnes has excellent sound quality and is comfortable to use. This is pretty much all that matters for me. Can't complain."}
{"review":"I am very frugal when it comes to buying things like professional headphones. I usually am willing to pay about $10 for headphones. I have been doing a lot of overtime lately and thought what the heck, go for it. I paid $41.02 including tax and free shipping. I must say that I am very impressed with these headphones. I like the strain relief that should stop one speaker from going out, which is why I needed a new pair. I also like the way they fit over my ears and block noise. These also have the wire on the left ear only no they don't irritate my neck like the cheaper sets do.\nWell for me it is a no brainer......BUY, BUY, BUY."}
{"review":"These headphones are the best I have ever used. They lasted me a good 5 years with amazing quality. When the first pair became a little worn out, i bought another exactly like it. These will last you a long time and play sound the way it is, not too much bass or treble. The only thing wrong with the first pair is that the cups began to fall apart, but that is acceptable after 5 years of constant use. I now have two pairs of terrific headphones. This is a great buy, I strongly recommend these."}
{"review":"These are clear and sharp and have the feel of studio cans. Cans yup, I am slinging the lingo.\nThe workmanship is excellent and these feel like you can toss them on the table and they won't break. I do not advise drop testing."}
{"review":"These headphones sound great with good bass response. The only downside is that the headphones after wearing them for more than 1 hour feel tight."}
{"review":"I bought these about 2 months ago after looking for an alternative to my in ear headphones. While in ear headphones are convenient and good for walking around, I wanted something better for at home and long distance travel (i.e. plane\/train\/etc.). I didn't want to spend $150+ on some of the bigger name items and while the ATH-M30's are not noise canceling, they do block out a lot of distractions. I listen to a wide array of music and the sound quality on them is incredible. I've tried some of the more expensive names and models at different electronics stores and I would put these right up there with those. The only drawback, for me, was the extra long cord. For $20 I took them to my local audio store and had the wire shortened to about 3.5 ft or so. If you're looking for a great pair of headphones at a great price, it's hard to beat the ATH-M30."}
{"review":"When I received these headphones in the mail I couldn't wait to strap them on. I was totally shocked by the sound of these for a price of $38, they're worth 3 times the price, easily! The bass is mindblowing! I've had several sets of headphones over the years and have never had any that compare to these, not even close! I had them on for 4 and a half hours when I received them and I didn't even want to take them off long enough to use the bathroom, or refill my coffee. Even after wearing them for such a long time I experienced no discomfort whatsoever.\n\nThe cord is an unheard of 11 feet long, and is a nice feature. I actually have a cable tie around a portion of the cord because it's so long. The wire is thick and extremely well made for headphones, with a spring type wire around where the wire meets the jack, where most cheap headphones tend to short out. The single wire coming from the left earpiece is also a great feature, it doesn't tend to get tangled up like the \"Y\" type wiring does.\n\nI can hardly wait for the snow to melt here in New York so I can try them out on my White's metal detector.\n\nNow I'm thinking about ordering the Audio-Technica ATH-M40FS model just to see if it's possible for them to sound even better than the Audio-Technica ATH-M30's do. Has anyone compared these 2 models side by side??\n\nMy brother tried mine out and wants me to order some for him. I'm sure that everyone who tries these on will want a set of their own.\n\nI would definitely recommend these to anyone, without a doubt! If anyone is considering buying these, just go for it, you won't be disappointed with your purchase!"}
{"review":"Great sound, especially for the price. Really good bass too. These would be good for anyone spending less than $2000 on headphones imo. Comfortable on the head, keeps noise out without having to use a battery powered system. Very thick and long cord with an plug that looks to be very durable. 5\/5"}
{"review":"While the ATH-M30 may not be top end Studio Headphones, it certainly does the job very well with more than adequate bass, mids, and treble.  It's more than enough for my home studio (if you can call it that) recordings.  Best of all, it's certainly worth well over its price tag!"}
{"review":"bought them for my wife for an international flight.  She likes them, I like them.. Sound is about as clean as the input I PUT into them.  garbarge in, garbarge out.  Now that trip is over, we use them for privacy and for working out.  They work good. Long cord, no complaints."}
{"review":"There are hundreds of good reviews that comment on the great sound and build quality on these headphones. I don't pretend to think that I'm going to add anything there, but I do have a big head and shallow headphone cups press on my ears and get uncomfortable after a while, so I thought I'd throw out my suggestion for that in hopes it might help someone.\n\nThe cups on these are relatively shallow when they come out of the package, but there is a fair amount of \"extra\" material in them and you can stuff something into the ear pad to puff them out creating a larger space for your ear. I rolled cotton balls into a snake and wrapped that in black duct tape. The ring I fashioned fit in the pocket between the plastic ear body and the pleather cushion that presses against your head. This lets me wear them for much longer periods of time without discomfort."}
{"review":"As far as I can tell these headphones produce a good sound and seem to be durable enough. The only negative is that they hurt my ears if I wear them for 2+ hours because the pads are not thick enough but it may just be the way my ears are shaped."}
{"review":"Regarding the price, ($40) its definitely the best headphone you can get.\nSounds clear and pretty comfortable.\nDon't expect too much for $40 headphones. It's really good for the price.\nCan't compare with the higher price ranged ones.\nI recommend it.\nJust for home uses so wouldn't be broken easily."}
{"review":"The Audio-Technica ATH-M30 are fantastic headphones. The build quality is very unexpected for such a low price and so is the sound. The highs, mids, and lows are all very good and accurate and with an equalizer, you can get more bass. I use my headphones primarily with my laptop and playing Flac files, I am always blown away. It would help to buy an amp to boost it a bit but it's still very good in that respect. The fit is perfect for me and it does adjust. It even came with a quarter inch adapter so when I get a chance, I'll play it on my Fathers audio setup.\n\nThe only issue I have are the pads which are made from material to look like fake leather that are known to start to flake after a few years. People may seem to find them uncomfortable after a few hours but believe me, compared to any Grado headphones, this is like having clouds on your ear after long use.\n\nAfter searching for months for a nice pair of over the ear headphones, I stumbled upon this from the fact that it had a near perfect review from Amazon so I bought it on an impulse since I'd been looking forever. I was nervous I had bought something without really looking into it (forums and such) other than reviews but I guess I was lucky that I did get them because they are pretty much perfect."}
{"review":"From the box, the M30s have the most neutral sound I've ever heard. It's flat, with no bass or treble tones at all. Several people have dinged them with one-star reviews because of this. All those folks had to do is plug their M30s into something with an equalizer. They're flat from the factory because they're meant for *-you-* to shape the sound. Once you exercise a little control and flex the EQ, man do they come alive! Solid lows, nice highs, and mids that don't sound scooped or flanged to oblivion. Listen to Lisa Gerrard sing, Joe Satriani's playing, or watch the film Heat and you get a feel for how well these M30s can reproduce sound. I've tried Logitech, Altec-Lansing, Turtle Beach, and several no-name brands. I'll stick with ATH-M30s until something better comes along. For under $50, I doubt you'd find a better pair of headphones."}
{"review":"I just got these headphones today and though I am thrilled with the sound, I was hoping for just a little more oomph to the sound and the bass, well mostly a little disappointed in the level of volume, a little spoiled by my previous headphones that had an ability to adjust volume right on the equipment itself. In other words I crave a little more volume capability. I put the equipment I'm using up at max volume (my tablet) but still the volume can use a little more lift, and I wish that the earphones had some kind of equipment on them where you can lift the volume higher if you so wanted, like I do... But,the sound is incredible in the bass, mid range and treble, all very clear and powerful in it's own right and you can get sounds in pieces you never knew were there, I mean really you can hear every little sound and instrumentation and voices you never knew were there in every piece you hear. Incredible.  And I love the long cord....can listen to a movie really loud and no one in the house will know. Great for my electronic piano too, brings out the sound of what I am playing really intricately. All in all I am thrilled with the surround sound quality of these headphones, just want more sound volume capability on the equipment itself. That's why the four stars. Still give it an A+++, just wanna be able to give it an A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++, but I am spoiled by previous equipment which wore out.  Too bad. I hope I fall in love with these anyway.  Okay time for an update, I have totally and completely fallen in love with these headphones! Found an equalizer on the tablet I was mostly listening to and boy,did it give me oomph...more like OOOMMMFFFF!! Wow! These headphones get five stars and an A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++!!! I can't take them off and don't and by the way there's a comfort to the earpieces so that I can wear for hours without discomfort. The surround sound is more than intense....meaning the sound travels from left to right and right to left, like the composer of the songs intended.. Get these, shopping around no longer necassary. You will love!"}
{"review":"These headphones are excellent value for money. The bass isn't too punchy but is still substantial. The highs are slightly muted, but not enough to be bothersome. I'm no audiophile, but I can appreciate a well-balanced set of cans. The fit is snug and there's just enough give to conform to weird cone head types. The build quality is solid and feel similar to much more expensive models. I was very happy with the packaging, it took a few seconds to open and didn't require me risking my limbs with a sharp object. These are the most impressive headphones at this price and they can compete with models costing up to $100."}
{"review":"I purchased these off of Amazon after getting moved to a busier place at my work place. I'm in a cube-farm doing programming and sometimes you just need to zone out from the talking, passer-byers and conference callers (one near my cube is on the phone constantly). These headphones are good - they're not the best for blocking out sound without any music playing, but once you get some beats going through them - you can create your own sanctuary.\n\nFor the price I paid - I feel I've gotten great value. I also love that the cord is so long! 11ft! I can move all around my cube and still have cable left over... in fact it might be a bit too long...but nothing that coiling it gently hasn't fixed. I also love the reinforcement around the jack - it ensures that it won't damage itself over the long run from the cord weight.\n\nAs for the technical frequency and range - I can't say much to that, I'm not versed in the subject. For my purposes it produces great quality sound - and sits comfortably on my ears, and doesn't bother my head with the band above. Lightweight too.\n\nThe only thing I read about and find true is that they 'snap' together, so if you want to ensure a long life, take care when you pull them off - properly have both hands on them and ease the ear pieces together - otherwise they will rather suddenly 'snap' together and it makes me concerned about what that will do in the long run.\n\nAgain, for the price point I feel I'm getting away with a steal here!\n\n-------------\nPros: Great sound, lightweight and comfortable resting position, plenty of cord, attention to detail by reinforced jack and thicker audio cord, amazing value\n\nCons: Tendency to 'snap' together when doing one-handed or quick removal (might damage itself if abused by quick removal over lifetime? not verified yet), long cord can be a bit too long at times."}
{"review":"I love these headphones! They are light, well padded, comfortable, adjustable and the sound is excellent. I think I got an excellent  product for a great price. The cord is long enough to work well with plenty of slack plugged into my iMac. I like that there's a single cord coming off the headphones instead of a right and left -- easier to take on and off that way.  No complaints. I'm very happy with them."}
{"review":"Garbage. No top end, not bottom end. No width Over ear cushions too small. I have been an Amazon customer since 2001, and this is the worst purchase that I have made in all that time. Not sure if I can return it, as the packaging is in the trash. Uuughhh!"}
{"review":"I didn't expect much from these headphones but was surprised at the clarity and bass it provides. Comfortable for long periods and the sound quality as I mentioned is great for the little small tag. I have had no problems with this one so far and use them extensively. I could not ask for a better pair for this amount of money. They are worth every cent and then some. And believe me when I say I know what clarity and quality sound is."}
{"review":"Pros:  These headphones are nigh indestructible and sound absolutely fantastic and they are cheap.\n\nCons:  Most people might find this a pro, but the cord is ridiculously long to the point of being annoying sometimes.\n\nWarnings:  These are high impedance headphones and require are pretty quiet if you just use them with a phone or ipod or computer.  I highly recommend using them with a small portable headphone amp.\n\nI think the pros far outweigh the cons on these headphones and they are a great deal.  I have been very impressed with Audio-Technica products.  I have a AT turntable and AT noise-cancelling earbuds.  All of them perform way above their price range."}
{"review":"No doubt that these headphones are of good quality, but after only wearing them for less than an hour, I start getting headaches and my ears were red and sore from it's tight grasp. I know this headphones are designed for professional use, still the cords are a little too long and it gets in the way of my chair and my entire body and it's a little annoying after a while of stumbling across the chords.\n\nAnyone here has any suggestions on how to deal with the part where it hurts my ears? Can I change the paddings or make the cups a little bigger so it encapsulates my ears better?\n\nI don't mind the other minor details, but I can barely wear it through a movie because it really presses on your ears and the upper part of my ears are really really sore after wearing it.\nIf not, I'll just have to send it back or something :\/ I really like the sound quality though."}
{"review":"These headphones are awesome because the sound is amazing and the bass is terrific. I use these headphones for computer use and ipod use and I have no problems thus far."}
{"review":"These head phones are simply Amazing! After reading all the positive reviews and looking at some other headphones. I decided on these, and they don't dissapoint. The first song i played when i got these was a techno song, and i gotta say the bass in these headphones are pretty good. They also sound great with all types of music. I would definitley Recomend you get these, and for only 40 bucks, you cant beat that price."}
{"review":"Truth be told, these are a very good quality set of cans for both studio and home use.\nExcellent bass response, smooth mid's and high's, overall very well balanced and after\nabout a 25 hour break in period, you will be looking for an imaginary subwoofer in your head!\nGreat for Laptop use if you actually like quality sound for extended listening."}
{"review":"You can find better. You can find cheaper. But, I doubt that you will find better for cheaper! I bought these for work, where I spend several hours a week doing quality analysis of call center agent phone calls. I needed something very comfortable enough to wear for a couple of hours a day.. and something durable enough to get tossed in a drawer at the end of the day. These fit both requirements well.\n\nFavorite things.. Soft, padded headband.. cushions without adding a lot of weight. The cable is only on one side, no more tangled cables going to both ears. The plug is solid metal, with a coil around the cable to prevent the cable from getting frayed at the connector."}
{"review":"These sound crisp and clear. The only negative, and not a large one at that, the bass isn't very full. But overall a pair of quality headphones."}
{"review":"I was hoping it had a little more noise cancelling capabilities since I was on a plane for a LONG time, but the sound is good and they're comfortable."}
{"review":"These are great headphones. The sound out of them is amazing. I can hear more bass sounds outside my head which helps me keep on track while drumming."}
{"review":"It's pretty worth for the price. Nice sound, good quality, not expensive. I think that's the best what I can get with about 40 dollars."}
{"review":"The mid's and bass freq. are decent, as well as the db ceiling, and I like the fact that they don't color the sound. When I monitor through headphones, which I know I shouldn't, I do not like for the sound to be processed with dynamics."}
{"review":"I love these headphones.  I use it at school and on long trips and they cancel out sound to my liking!  If you want absolute silence than you might want to look for something else, but these work great for me!"}
{"review":"I bought these for myself because I needed a good pair of headphones but my son loved them so much I gave them to him. I'm not an audiophile but I know what I like and these are able to handle the bass and volume with no feedback and without sounding flat! I will probably be getting another pair for me."}
{"review":"Love this product. I use them all the time.\n\nPros: Sounds amazing; I'm a musician and I've been trained to listen closely to other instruments within the group so my ear isn't too shabby, but using these headphones makes it so that I don't even have to try focusing on new sounds and instruments; The quality is so good and sounds so natural. I haven't had these for a very long time but I can definitely tell these were built very well and are quite sturdy. The price is awesome. I feel like I got really lucky getting these for only about $45.\n\nCons: Very few if any. In the inside of the ear cups there's a tiny bit of pressure where the tip of the ears are. So for the first couple of hours it's good but then I start getting a little sore on the ends of my ear. But nothing a good ear rub won't fix."}
{"review":"So after reading all the reviews and watching the prices, they finally dropped to a point where they were worth the 'experiment'. There is always the possibility that I have ended up with a unit that is on the lower end of the quality control spectrum. I will test them out for a week or two and update my review. This review is meant to shed light or corroborate other reviews. Other 'professional' calibre headphones that I own and frequently use are Bose QuietComfort 15 and the Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series (which are effectively identical to  the Sony MDR7506 Professional). I own several other panasonic, sony, skull candy, in ear\/ neckbands etc. I have a set of headphone each type of activity and have developed this collection over the years. I really want to like these and add a reasonable Audio-Technica to my collection.\n\nPros\nThe fit on my average size head is comfortable.\nI thought the noise isolation was pretty good.\n\nCons\nThey are definitely supra-aural (sitting on your ears) headphones  unless you really have small ears.\nThe connector and coil issue: I also had the right ear out initially, moving around the coil resolved it. I want to see if the issue is tolerable. I  plugged it to my laptop as well as into the port of the speaker system amplifier. The issues went away when plugged straight (no angles) into the amp's port.\nYou have to increase the volume to get some oomph.\n\nI will keep testing them and update the review along the way. My concern so far is that the coil is a permanent one going into the headphones themselves so should I need to replace them in the future, well that won't be possible.\n\nUpdate 10\/21: I observed that the sound problems, distribution between the ears and other issues (what may have appeared to be a 'broken' cable) disappear if the headphone jack is not inserted all the way. The sound\/pulses 'conduct' better if it is very slightly out of the port. Clearly someone in materials\/engineering messed this one up while designing the connector. The connector is probably the worst part of these headphones as it appears that someone strayed from convention and tried to be clever with the design. I am all for thinking out of the box but QC folks should have sounded the alarm. Comfort is still under 45 minutes-hour- while that is not great, it does force me not to sit for extended period of time so I think of this as a blessing in disguise or perhaps I am just looking for the silver lining to retain these dirt cheap (relatively) head phones. The price point right now cannot be beaten, I may just return this unit and get another one as these connector problems seem to be not so prevalent based on the hundreds of other reviews."}
{"review":"I have this model \"Panasonic RPDJS400K DJ Street Model Headphones\" and I've tested both headphones side-to-side and with another brand within the same range. I believe the Panasonic sound even a bit better than this one and for a lower price.\n\nEDIT: after a while, the sound of this set has improved noticeably (or maybe I got used to a different sound)... Now I must say that for the price I paid for it, there is hardly a better option."}
{"review":"I was getting overwhelmed looking at headphone reviews here on Amazon and decided to pull the trigger on these ATs.  I'm so happy I did.  I'm a professional musician and need good headphones for referencing mixes.  I've been through a couple of pairs of Sony (one of which was the MDR-V55, the rip off of the Beats headphones... horrible!  What a joke.  So much bass your molars will fall out) but wasn't satisfied.  My only complaint about these ATs are that the volume is a bit low.  But that's ok with me as the the entire audio range is really well represented.  I could hear fully articulated 808 drums all the way up to really high (like 8k or 10k) crispy hi hats really clearly.  I recommend these headphones."}
{"review":"I bought 2 of these for watching discovery tv late at night. They are comfortable, sound great, fair price too. The long 11 foot cord reduces the need for an extension cable risking quality loss. I am very happy with price, delivery time as allways and sound."}
{"review":"And that being said, that's just out of the box. I bought this model because I hear it's actually quite decently moddable, so when I get the time I'll probably craft it to better fit my needs. Otherwise, pretty good for the price."}
{"review":"My Son requested this for a Christmas gift.  He now can practice his piano at anytime.  Even if everyone else has already gone to bed.  He can plug them into his Clavinova."}
{"review":"Used for home studio mixing for guitars, bass and drums mainly.\n\nPros:\nCable is extra long\n1\/8\" to 1\/4\" adapter is \"screwable\" so it will keep your signal good even if you move around\nDoesn't fool you as other bass enhancing headphones.  What you hear through this, is what you will hear in your car stereo or ipod.\n(some headphones make your mixing sound perfectly, and when you play it elsewhere, the mix sounds totally different)\nComfortable, you don't head tired of wearing them\n\nCons:\nCompared to my \"bass enhancing headphones,\" this headphones sometimes start clipping when I play my bass\nThe leather or vinyl material that goes around your ears is the classic material that starts to wear out and break as you sweat it or if you leave it in any warm place\n\nOther than these 2 comments, for the price, and if you are looking to hear your mix as real as possible, this is a good choice."}
{"review":"Audio-Technica makes it possible to get high quality headphones with high value.  It's a refreshment as a consumer today to get value with my money.  This headphone set delivers on those two dynamics.  The trebles and bass were both in sync.  Keep in mind,  I don't have a professional ear.  But having listened to music on headphones before many times, I think I have a good ear for how good music can sound.  For me, as long as I'm getting a satisfactory experience from my favorite music, Im good.  The headphones deliver a full rich sound on all types of music that I listen to, hip hop, alternative, reggae, and some classical.  My expectations are exceeded, which leaves me completely satisfied especially with the money that I spent on it."}
{"review":"This is amazing headphone. Is goood. Use for long time and is good. GORD GORD GORD. Super long audio cable which helps me out but may be a nuisance for other."}
{"review":"Have had for a few weeks now, they sound great and have been reliable thus far.  Only gripe is that I wish the surround cushions had a slightly larger inner diameter to fit my ears better, might get uncomfortable for anyone with big ears."}
{"review":"Headphones are lightweight, okay for big head, with decent sound for 40 bucks.\n\nBut they might be not very convenient for street use cause of very long cord."}
{"review":"I bought these not knowing what to use as a reference so I  went sight unseen. They actually are a very good set. I feel like I got my moneys worth. The delivery and packaging were excellent."}
{"review":"These headphones are great! It has great sound; everything sounds so much louder, so much clearer! Plus, the extra long cord allows me to plug in 10 ft. away. I definitely would recommend these headphones to anyone! The price is reasonable, and the quality  is great!"}
{"review":"These headphones are better than some of the top of the line head phones that are triple the price. Here the price is a bit misleading - these are solid. These headphones are worth every penny and more.\n\nI use these to play electric guitar every day, and the cord is long enough and comes with a sterio adapter. (not sure that was actually mentioned in the description)\n\nI highly recommend these headphones!!!"}
{"review":"Pulling the M30s out of the box the first thing you'll notice is how long the cord is. It's perfect for the person who wants to play Xbox or watch a movie without waking up the family. Luckily my TV (some inexpensive Westinghouse) had a standard headphone jack in the back. The M30s also come with the larger adapter for your receiver.\nThe headphone are comfortable (I have a big head) and sound really good. Are they on par with the higher end over the ear headphones that cost $300? No. But, they are an amazing value for what your paying for."}
{"review":"Amazing product. Just got it in today, it's got amazing quality, all the lows and highs are there. The pads on the ears are fantastic and the sound stays in the headphones well! The cord is long enough to suit a guitarist or other musician and includes a cable adapter which functions better than any i've seen with a screw-in mechanism that is gold plated and functions perfect at either connection. Well made, great price - NO REGRETS!"}
{"review":"These are so overrated. They comfort is great, but if you actually care about sound quality, DO NOT GET THESE! The apple headphones or skull candies are better than these"}
{"review":"These head phones work great with my cell phone as far as volume. There great on my Sony, and Kenwood stereo. The highs, and lows are great. They also work good for talk radio. When working with the landscaping on my property the sound is out standing, and the paddling in the sides, and top are great. I have used the Beats head phone before I was not that impressed. For the price you want beat these all around impressive head phone. By the way it comes with the screw on extinction works wonders for the cross over."}
{"review":"I use these in my home studio and they work really well. They built very well and are very comfortable. The sound quality is clear on all three ranges. If you are looking for quality headphones and do not want to break bank, this is the way to go. You really do not need anything belse for home studio purposes."}
{"review":"They arrived on time and as expected. I have had other head phones about the same price but these are the best. The sound is crisp and clear. I bought two and would buy another two."}
{"review":"I've owned the headphones for 3 weeks now. After about 45 minutes of wearing the headphones they become extremely irritating. Its just too tight on my head (I am 6 feet tall).\n\nThe sound quality is decent for the price, but the comfort level sucks."}
{"review":"Wearing 'em now! Great sound. :) Only way these could go wrong is if they break. Wore 'em for several hours yesterday, and only felt minor discomfort."}
{"review":"Before judging these you MUST BREAK THEM IN!!\nI was ready to send them back because of my initial disappointment. But i then read in a review\nto play them overnight for a few days to break them in,,, Wow i am glad i did. These may not be in the ath-m50 category,\nbut for $40,, i will keep them as long as they last. The highs at first were not crisp,,had an unnatural tone to them,, But from just a few days of leaving music running through overnight, they have 'expanded' beautifully. Have 5 pairs of mid to expensive phones, and i would totally recommend these for everyday use. They are very soft and comfortable to wear. At least with my mid sized head,,,,,"}
{"review":"as a novice when it comes to music equipment in general, these sound fantastic to me, feel great, and were a great price compared to other headphones of similar design and quality."}
{"review":"These headphones are comfortable to wear, and the enclosed design helps reduce background noise.  The sound is good for the price, though I wish the reproduction was a bit more transparent.  Quiet sounds can get lost at low volume.  The long cord is convenient if you need some freedom to move around while wearing the headphones."}
{"review":"The sound quality of these headphones is great. I can hear certain parts of songs I've never heard before on speakers or other sets of headphones. They also work very well with my ipod touch's equalizer to create the sound I want. The only complaint I have about these is how uncomfortable they feel after 45 mins to an hour of wearing them. The best thing to do is just take a 15-20 min break when my ears start hurting, put them on again and usually after that they feel fine. This isn't exactly a complaint, but there are some people that might have a problem with how big the earpieces are. I don't mind because I've only worn them at home, but if you're traveling or doing some type of activity, these are very big and bulky and might get in the way. I really love the long cord, I can have them plugged into my computer and move around the room without yanking out the cord. These are a really great deal for the price, I just wish they were more comfortable."}
{"review":"The sound is great, and the fit is pretty comfortable. Easily work for long periods without discomfort. They feel sturdy without being too heavy or cumbersome."}
{"review":"I have a history of destroying headphones. I use them all the time and would go through a pair every two months. I've had these for about five months now and they are still working wonderfully. They are very comfortable and the sound quality is great. I live across the street from two bars on a college campus, which means the noise levels outside can become quite loud. With these headphones, it is very easy to tune the extra noise out and focus on my work. I really hope they continue to last, and am very happy I spent a little more money for this higher quality product."}
{"review":"Our home has a rather open floorplan.  Consequently our home theater area, my wife's computer area and my computer area are all within easy earshot of each other.  All three systems are set up for Blu-ray and high def viewing and it isn't unusual for one of us to be watching the TV or a movie on the home theater system while the other is working, listening to music, or watching a different movie on their computer. We've used earbuds or open foam headphones to listen to our respective computers while the other is utilizing the main theater system.  Unfortunately earbuds tend to give a rather flat sound experience and open headphones just don't block out any of the intruding sound.\n\nAfter a bit of research combined with a general unwillingness to spend a lot of money, I decided to experiment and purchase the Audio-Technica M30 headphones. Then I compared the M30s with my favorite earbuds, open headphones, and my desktop computer's dual speaker system to evaluate performance while listening to DVDs, Blu-rays, music, and Amazon Prime movie downloads.  The M30s won hands down.\n\nMy overall first impression was that the M30s added high def sound to the headphone experience.  The depth and sound direction was like having a home theater system on my head.  If you remember watching familiar movies on HD for the first time and how you noticed things you never saw before, the same thing happens with the sound on these headphones.  The sound is crisp, rich, and alive with a nice depth, especially with movies.\n\nThey are comfortable, and I wear wire rimmed glasses.  I have avoided closed-back headphones because they tend to hurt my ears especially when I'm wearing my glasses.  After wearing the M30s for three hours, there was minor discomfort that little positional shift eliminated completely.  With closed-back headphones the skull bridge can often put excessive pressure on the ears, adding to the discomfort and pain.  The M30's pressure is light yet keeps the headphones nicely in place.\n\nOthers have said the headphones have no bass range.  I didn't find that to be exactly accurate.  I've always used The Eagles as is a good test of balanced bass in music.  The bass is absolutely apparent in all their classics.  What is missing is the thumping subwoofer experience, something we've become accustomed to over the years with movies and clubs.  With the M30s the balanced low to high range is excellent but there's no thumping vibration.  If thumping bass is what you desire, the M30s won't be for you.  If balance is what you seek, you'll be happy, especially at the M30 price point.\n\nThe M30s also did a nice job of eliminating about 80% of the intruding sounds from the home theater system and ambient conversations.  It is very easy to mentally block out the remaining 20% as your focus shifts to the movie or music.  One simple example; my wireless keyboard is rather noisy.  I don't listen to music or movies at high volume levels, preferring about 40-50% max volume or less on my computer.  Even at the 15-20% level I can't hear my keyboard at all as I type while listening to music.\n\nFor the money, the M30's are a great value and purchase.\n\nUpdate:  My wife came home from a business trip and after settling back home she saw the headphones sitting on my desk plugged into my computer.  She put them on, listened to some music then a streaming movie for maybe 5 minutes while I was out of the room.  When I walked back in she asked \"How much are these?\"  When I told her she said \"buy me a pair, now.\"  A second set for her is on the way."}
{"review":"In my opinion, these are by far the best money i ever spent on headphones compare to the overly priced ones. They do a great job on mids and high ranges for music. The bass is great, its not to soft nor is it to hard, i mean seriously i wouldnt want to rupture my ear drums so i believe the bass is just right. I've also tested on my ipad and laptop, watching movies, just at 50% volume you can block out outside noises, which is great. I have yet to find a con for this headphone...but it looks like i won't find any!"}
{"review":"I'm no audiophile at all, don't get me wrong, but I am picky about the quality of headphones, earbuds, speakers, etc to an extent. I have used a few different pairs of headphones in the past, and these ones are by far the most comfortable. They squeeze a bit tight on your head at first, but within a couple weeks they will fit perfectly snug on your head. I LOVE how the cord feels really high quality, the jack is a nice durable heavy metal, very awesome, much better then any other jack I have ever seen. The cord also has a spring on it at the end, probably so that the cord doesn't bend to much and get ruined from the metal of the jack or something, which is also very useful. The sound quality of these are amazing compared to what I have used in the past, crystal clear audio as far as voices and instruments and what not, however the bass is almost non-existent, so if you listen to bass heavy music, then these aren't what you would want to be wearing to listen to that kind of music. I happen to not enjoy bassy headphones or earbuds or anything because I don't enjoy the thumping in my ear, I prefer to use speakers and a subwoofer for that kind of music, making these perfect for everything else. They are quiet closed and can really do a great job of getting rid of outside noise, I'm sure not as good as some of the bigger, heavier headphones, but these things are nice and light for how well they block out sound. It is also hard to hear any sound coming from them from outside until you turn it up to a certain volume, but you can get high enough to listen to music perfectly well without any sound able to escape for others around you to hear. Next time I get headphones I might try to get something as close to these as possible, only with more bass."}
{"review":"Headphone jack broke in my phone after maybe ten uses. I now do not have a phone or headphones. These sounded great but like there could be a change the jack could break."}
{"review":"Rather than paying a couple of hundred bucks for the silly Dr. Dre stuff, these cans are a real bargain and sound almost as good as headphones costing over five times as much.  Love 'em..."}
{"review":"These headphones are very good for the cost. I tried them and the AKG K77 headphones, and chose these. They offer very good clarity.  I found them superior to the K77 for clarity and 'hifi' type sound. The K77's have more bass and achieve higher volumes. I choose the clarity.\nIf I had lots of money I'd spend a lot on AT headphones."}
{"review":"Se escuchan perfectamente. El sonido es ntido y el precio es bueno. El cable es largo cosa que va muy bien para enchufarlos en la tv y no molestar por la noche. El cable es muy resistente.\nLos recomiendo."}
{"review":"I picked these up last week on sale for $35.  These are exceptionally comfortable and clear headphones.  I am considering using these as my primary headphones when I'm mixing.  The external sound reduction could be a bit better, but they are comparable to some of the lower end DJ headphones (HDJ and Allen and Heath).  Would have been nice to have a coiled cord on this model, but that is more of a personal preference than a design flaw."}
{"review":"I would highly recommend to anyone who like to listen trance music...\n\nMy ears paining a bit after a while... thats why i am giving 4 stars otherwise these are really good headphones"}
{"review":"I love these headphones.\n\nPros:\n- Sounds great. I'm no audiophile, but I am rather pleased.\n- Generally comfortable for a short amount of time\n- Feels high quality and made of good material\n- yet, remains reasonably light and doesn't make my head feel heavy\n\nCons:\n- looooooooooooong cable. I have to keep more than half the chord tied up in a twistie to keep it manageable. Minor inconvenience though.\n- I have to often wear these headphones for MANY hours at a time, and after about 3 hours it is uncomfortable and painful enough that I have to take them off. Perhaps this is unique to me though, since I have these tiny ears. Also, this probably won't apply to most people because 3+ hours is a bit excessive. Anything below that and the headphones are nice and comfy on my head.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this product. Maybe not for people who will be wearing them all day though."}
{"review":"I don't know about Professional Studio earphones.  I bought them on sale and use them to listen to Pandora at work.\n\nProbably says in the description somewhere's but I was just too to excited to get these on sale and didn't read.\nThe cord is darn near 9 ft long.  Might be good for you, but if I want to go for a walk or something, I need to roll the whole thing up and put it the front pocket of my pull over.  It is about 4 one foot loops and it feels ridiculous.\n\nMy ears are kinda big in the vertacle direction (uh... tall ears I guess).  They rest on the top but they are still comfortable."}
{"review":"I bought these due to the user rating... and man, I am glad I that I took the advice and bought these. they sound awesome, fit great and I have a HUGE head and again, sound awesome."}
{"review":"I'm not an audiophile, I was just looking for some good headphones. I saw some good reviews and I purchased it. When I received it today, I went to YouTube to listen to super high quality music, and wasn't disappointed! These headphones are great! I mean, I don't know any fancy audiophile words to accurately describe these, but there wasn't anything I didn't like! Seriously, these are perfect! (I suppose the only thing is they don't look amazing, but they look fine. Just not designer headphones or anything. If you are some person who only cares about how they look and doesn't like this, go away, these headphones are great :))"}
{"review":"I have been using this with my T-Mobile G2 Android phone, for music and games. Sound quality is excellent, and superior to the quality from a pair of earbuds I purchased for the same purpose, at a similar price. The headset can be adjusted to a good fit, and holds its fitting quite well. This is possibly the most comfortable headset I've ever used.\n\nThe cable is much longer than I need for my application; it would have been nice if it had at least come with some convenient way to coil up the excess cabling."}
{"review":"I ordered these over the Panasonic RP-HTX7, about $10 more, Since I didn't get the Panasonic pair, I cannot say what they sound like. I like these very much, they have a nice range of sound, I listen to hair band, classic rock and country, basically anything that has actual instruments.  They have the nice high (cymbals and snare) and the nice low (bass and bass drum).  The vocals are clear as well. Too many times I get headphones that have one or the other not both. Of course because I was on the low end phones, get what you pay for and these are a bargain in my opinion for the price. I like how these have a spring type protector around the wire by the jack, keeps from being snapped or long termed bent.  I gave it four star due to the fact there is one test I haven't put it thru, the test of time, will be back to see how that goes."}
{"review":"Very comfortable adjustable fit (*even a cushion for the crown of your head), The sound is studio quality with all instruments crystal clear. Good price, fast shipping, no complaints."}
{"review":"Bought this as a gift for my 17 yr old son and he is very happy with sound quality-\nAlso not as easy to misplace as those little ear buds! :)"}
{"review":"Lovely headphones. I am not an audiophile but the sound is great and very clear and realistic. I would buy them again if I needed another pair."}
{"review":"After trying numerous headset under $50 from panasonic sony skullcandy i must say that this is one of the best out there on the market. Good surround sound the only disadvantage is that it the wire length. The length of the wire is too long and u need to stuff the extra length of wire in ur pocket. Otherwise this is a STEAL"}
{"review":"I love these headphones! They're comfortable and the sound is amazing! Coming from using iPhone headphones to mix my music (as of late), it's like night and day. My last professional\/studio headphones were the Sennheiser HD 201's, and the ATH-M30's blow those out of the water. I used these with my computer volume on 50% and I couldn't hear any background noises at all.\n\nThe bass is great. Not muddy at all. I can really hear 808s and basslines very well: 4\/5.\n\nThe mids are ok, Pretty accurate description of what they actually sound like: 3.5\/5.\n\nThe highs are great as well. Probably the best aspect of these headphones, 5\/5.\n\nOverall, these headphones are definitely worth buying if you're into recording\/producing music or just want to listen to music on another level. 4\/5 stars!"}
{"review":"I'm no audiophile, but I love getting the best sound possible from my music. These headphones, while not the best that money can buy, are an incredible value. The sound that comes through these is rich, clear, and warm. The only problem with high quality headphones, of course, is that it's very apparent that mp3s are low quality. But that's beside the point. I hooked these headphones up to my Sony turntable and DEAR GOD it was the best sound I have ever heard.\n\nSince these are studio monitor headphones I was a little worried about getting a deep bass from them. I enjoy dubstep, house, and hip-hop music, so I need headphones that deliver a nice bass sound. I worried for nothing! The bass is far better than I expected. I'm so glad I didn't get a pair of bass-boosting headphones because the level put out by these is perfect. Classical and jazz sound great with these too--I can't think of anything that wouldn't.\n\nI find these Audio-Technicas quite comfortable, too. They also block out a significant amount of noise, even when not playing anything, which is great because I have noisy roommates! Some people might find the extra-long cord annoying. I do not. I have the extra cord wrapped up with a twist tie and it works just fine. In fact, I need the extra length so I hook these up to my turntable and go lie down and relax. If I need to be walking around while listening to my ipod I just put the wound up cord in my pocket.\n\nSo long story short: wonderful pair of headphones. For the price, you can't beat 'em!"}
{"review":"I use these headphones for a home studio.  They are fantastic and have great range.  I can hear things I have never heard before in music and in my voice.  They are my favorite go-to head phones and I love everything about them except the ear cushions.  After about an hour on your head they start to hurt.  I wish there was an upgrade for the foam, then they would beat any pair I own... even the $200 ones!  Not bad for a $40 pair!"}
{"review":"these are good headphones, and for the price, nobody has ANY reason to whine.\nthey do the job as well as ones that are 3x the price.\nRECOMMENDED."}
{"review":"Now, I'm not what you call an audiophile, and I don't have a lot of experience with a lot of sets of headphones, but I can tell you that these cans are a big-time step up over what I have been using (a set of wireless headphones and some cheap wired ones from Sony).  The bass actually sounds like bass, and the music just seems fuller than before.  They block a lot of the outside ambient noise and allow me to immerse myself in my music.\n\nBasically, if you're looking for inexpensive headphones that will really deliver your music, this is it."}
{"review":"I was looking for a quality, solid closed back headphone, and these really did fit the bill quite well.\n\nFirst off, the M-30's are not noise cancelling, but do a very good job at blocking most of the noise. The first day I had them, my wife was running the hair dryer in the adjacent room, and I could not hear the noise from that, and I was listening to acoustic guitar music, so there was plenty of opportunity to hear the external noise.\n\nOthers have said the bass is not as well defined - I respectfully disagree, but it also can be personal taste as well. They aren't \"boomy\" bass headphones, but are very well balanced.\n\nSo far, the build quality is nice and solid. My only question about them is going to be headband comfort, but I need to still work with them to make sure of that. But ears are comfy.\n\nAll in all, a NICE set of studio type headphones, especially for the less than $50 category. Comes with both 1\/8\" and 1\/4\" screw on adapter (1\/8\" is the default and can adapt to 1\/4\").\n\nAs usual, Amazon shipping was nice and quick. Also, the packaging was easy open! Didn't have to slice it up or my hands. I love that!"}
{"review":"I wanted a set of headphones for work with Garage Band for voice recordings and some amateur music - these fit the bill perfectly. I find them very comfortable but am only wearing them for an hour or so at a time. The sound isn't too bright but very comfortable and clean - great when listening to various music genres. I certainly don't find the bass too boomy either."}
{"review":"I don't like earbuds...the sound is never right and I am used to listening through headphones from working in studios, with radio, and doing audio engineering...found these on sale and picked 'em up. Very nice sound and surprisingly efficient. Audio-Technica is a very consistent brand..highly recommended."}
{"review":"I bought both of these headphones at the same time, not sure of what I wanted. I like bass response but also audio clarity. My review is based off of sound and comfort. I'll start with comfort because that's easiest.\n\nComfort:\nEven the best sounding headphones absolutely suck if they hurt after only 30 minutes of listening. This is the case I found with the M30s vs. the XB500s. After wearing the M30s for about 45 minutes, my ears began to get irritated. I cannot say the same for the XB500s. It's like the XB500s have two pillows resting against your ears. Comfort for the XB500s scores 5\/5...the M30s get a 3\/5. I feel like I could sleep in the XB500s. They are perhaps the best headphones I've experienced from a comfort standpoint.\n\nSound:\nSound quality is why we buy headphones. In my opinion, the quality of the M30s far surpassed the XB500s. In fact, the XB500s are already packed up and ready to be shipped back to Amazon (thank you for the awesome return policy and service Amazon). Don't stop reading now. The only reason the XB500s are going back is because bass isn't my fancy. Here are three different songs I listened to in testing the cans:\n\nT.I. - Whatever You Like:\nXB500 - Impressive. If you are a bass junkie, these are awesome cans.  I like this song but it doesn't have a lot of audio components to it. I selected it because it's bass heavy. The XB500s definitely won hands down with this track.\nM30 - Bass response was not bad by any means. The Sony's crushed them but they performed pretty well but didn't even come close to hanging with the Sony's. Again, the bass notes hit well but these headphones are made for an \"all around sound\". They got dominated it the bass arena.\n\nAdele - Set Fire to the Rain:\nXB500 - This song tells a completely different story.\"Set Fire to the Rain\" has a decent bass line but the XB500s took it way to far. It was so much so that it was distracting to the lyrics. Mids and highs were completely drown out by the bass.\nM30 - Seems like a perfect harmony of highs and lows for these headphones. The bass notes hit but not to heavy. Near the end of the song, I noticed notes and chords that I have not noticed before.\n\nCall of Duty - Modern Warefare 3:\nXB500 - I played this with a colleague of mine the day I got both headphones. The XB500s were awesome when firing the light machine gun. It somewhat felt like I had the actual gun in my hand because my head was literally felling every shot from the sound. The ambient sound was ok. Nothing was pronounced.\nM30 - I must say I tip my hat to the XB500s in this example. I appreciated the response when firing the light machine gun but it was nowhere near the Sony's. The highlight with these was the clarity. I could easily pick up on the location of enemies (right, left, front, and back) of enemies based from the sounds. While I loved firing the light machine gun with the Sony's, the clarity of the M30s gave me a better advantage.\n\nBottom line:\nThe M30s win this battle because they are an excellent value. The XB500s will be returned, however, they are extremely comfortable and a great headphone but the bass was too overpowering.  I will most likely return the M30s as well because of comfort even though they sound great. I'm listening to music while writing this review and they are already hurting my ear. Sound quality of the M30s is great...comfort, not so much (for me that is).I will be getting a set of V-Moda M-80s headphones (not the same price range I know). I haven't purchased them yet so look for my review over there shortly."}
{"review":"My husband is an audiophile, so I did a TON of research before buying these for him this Christmas.  These were by far the top choice of all the music junkies I know - they have excellent sound quality and the noise canceling feature is wonderful.  Hubby is happy, using them multiple times a day and I'm happy knowing his hearing won't be damaged cranking the volume on a cheaper set, after all I want him to be able to hear me when we're old!"}
{"review":"very good regarding :\n- I am not an audio pro but I work with audio often and I can say it has a nice audio quality\n- blocking ambient noise\n- slightly more comfortable - for people who wear glasses like - than other cheaper products\n- long wire"}
{"review":"I'm satisfied for the price, good quality overall and sounds is good.\nI will give 4 stars because they look cheap and no volume control on it.\nBut for the sound and price I would buy again. Recommended."}
{"review":"I had these for less than a week, but unfortunately, the right side stopped working. Hard to say for sure what the sound quality was. I think it had potential, but they had not broken in yet."}
{"review":"First let me make it absolutely clear, I am not brilliant when it comes to sound quality. If you want a pro, look at someone else's. If you're a regular Joe, I might be able to help.\nSo after my sister got a a pair of Beats, I decided to get a pair of good headphones for myself. However, lacking half a grand I decided to go a cheaper route. These had across the board good reviews so I decided on these. They sound amazing. Going head to head with my sisters Beats there is no difference. Everything has depth and realism, and I now understand why people whine about bad headphones. Worth every penny of the $40 I paid. My only complaint is that it has a really long cord. I'm six and a half feet tall, and the cord drags along the ground when I stand, so it's not the best for on the go. Beyond that, no problems."}
{"review":"Light, confortable, the sound is so clear that you can discriminate each instrument, just perfect and the price is as good as the product.\nThe sound reproduction on this product seems very \"natural\" and undistorted. And not \"tinny\"-sounding, like can be the case with many different headphone brands."}
{"review":"Just got these today, and going through several Playlists of country, rock, pop, jazz and  they sound great. I had a pair of Bose headphones and these match if not beat them. The bass, midrange and highs all sound perfect. Chris Botti and his percussion instruments are clear and deep, his sax highs are blazing. Zac Brown and his accoustic guitar chops and blusey voice are vibrant. I would have paid more knowing these are so good. But them while they are still in inventory."}
{"review":"I'm no audiophile, nor do I have expansive knowledge in studio headphones, but I can say with confidence the sound quality of these audio-technicas are fantastic. I'm transitioning from a pair of nicer Sony in-ears for home use and definitely can notice the boost in bass and overall more balanced midrange\/trebles. The heavier gauge cord has zero external noise from any jostling or movement. The bundled 1\/4\" jack is a screw-on and looks like it should last.\n\nAs for the cushioning and comfort, it isn't quite as good as I was hoping. I have a moderately large headsize and also wear glasses, which interfere with the earpads a bit. The higher tension of the audio-technicas also causes minor irritation after 1 hour of use. The pair of Sony XD200s I've used in the past had bigger earpads with greater cushion depth, which felt better having glasses on.\n\nFor its price, the audio-technicas M30s have superior audio performance but I would recommend a try if possible if you happen to wear eye glasses."}
{"review":"This were rated well and I was pleasantly surprise as the price was very good. The long cord is a bit of a hassle at times."}
{"review":"The wife bought it off of my wish list. Hey whats better than getting something you already want. Its great. I'm a low rate sound man and I may not have the best hearing, but these headphones rock my world for the price. Sure you are not going to get the same stares from the non-audiophile beats wearing peeps. But you'll know what your hearing. Not pounding bass , but a full range of sound that is candy for the ear drums."}
{"review":"Great response on all frequencies, even cheaper with amazon prime! very pleased with my purchase here. 1\/4'' jack screws off for your 1\/8'' connectors like ipods, laptops, and then screws back on for larger interfaces like turn table mixers or mbox cues."}
{"review":"Great quality, great sound and great comfort.... I'd definitely recommend these headphones to anyone who wants to build a quality recording studio... A great inexpensive product."}
{"review":"I bought these to replace an old pair of Koss closed ear sound insulating headphones. They are more comfortable than my old headphones and much lighter. But sadly the sound is nowhere near as good. They lack bass depth and the sound is not detailed. It sounds as if there is a small pillow between my ear and the earpiece. Overall the product is okay. The design and build quality is very good. The sound quality while mediocre is acceptable for my main use -- listening to TV."}
{"review":"Please note i don't use these for anything professional. Simply for music on my laptop. I'm not a pro as you will find out below.\n\nSince I've owned them, 7 mos ago, they have been banged around, stepped on, and traveled the country with. They still have no problems. They have excellent sound quality; not the biggest bass the headphones these days boast for but they have really clear sound and decent bass. Even though these don't advertise it, they are quite excellent at reducing the noise around you. They worked great on the plane, in a room of talking people etc.\n\nProbably the thing I love about these the most, but I thought I would've hated it was the extremely long aux cable. But it's very convenient! Screw wireless technology, you can easily use these on the other side of your room.\n\nThis really should be the cap on what we humans pay for a quality pair of headphones. I don't understand the whole $399 for a pair that everyone seems to be into. Buy something like this and put the rest of that money in investments. I've tried Bose and Beats, and here's the major differences: Bose clarity will obviously be different better and they will be able to cancel sound out better. Not worth the $250 difference. Beats will have some more bass and obviously be flashier, but that's it."}
{"review":"These are good value studio monitor. I use them for listening to music in shared office environments and podcasting. Lightweight, but solid construction. No ear fatigue after wearing for most of the day. Cord is really long."}
{"review":"First off length of cord is a plus as I do not need my extension with this plenty long enough.  The sound quaility is great and they are very comfortable,  have fell asleep with on and was not disturbed.  Noise cancelation is not as great as would have liked but am still happy with headset."}
{"review":"Great sound quality, and it fits over my ears very welll. My only problem with it is that the cord is much longer than I'm used to and it can be a pain storing it."}
{"review":"I look forward to being at work and listening to music through these.  I reviewed affordable headphones online and came across these.  The sound quality is incredible."}
{"review":"I had sony noise canceling set that broke and after reading the reviews of this product i decided to give it a try. It is amazing. I would never expect such high quality for such low price. It is about 2x times cheaper then my sony and about 10x better. This is realistic approximation. I can't stop watching movies now as it reminds me of being in an IMAX theater even though i am using my 17 inch laptop."}
{"review":"The quality is great and the sound is clear.  They are comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  This is the best set of headphones I've owned."}
{"review":"These headphones, for the price, are a great deal. They sound great as studio monitor headphones. The response is clean and flat, exactly what I was looking for. Perfect for mixing and audio production."}
{"review":"A great set of headphones: cheap product, but a quality sound!  I'm very happy with it.\n\nPros:\nGreat sound quality\nLong cord\nPlug-and-play\nComfortable to wear\nWide sound range (doesn't blast your eardrums in)\n\nCons:\nRather big (but all good headphones are)\nIf you want a coiled cord, you're out of luck (but I didn't, so this isn't a con for me)"}
{"review":"I bought these because they were on sale at the time for 40 bucks! I figured with a 100+ original price tag, I'd give it a try and I'm placing the order for a second pair while the price is this good! Get them! I'm a producer\/writer\/engineer so in my experience headphones like these start at 150 easy"}
{"review":"Fit good, soft on ears, good sound, I use for playing wow and it makes me feel like Im in the game. I can still hear enough for emergencys but it blocks most outside noise. Price was fair and would buy again"}
{"review":"I started with a pair of Bluetooth headphones, which were rated pretty good. While it was convenient to use those without wires, the sound wasn't that great.  As I read more, I found that most of the Bluetooth headphones under $100 aren't really known for sound quality because of the compression of the signal.\n\nI decided that sound quality was more important to me than the convenience of moving around the room without wires.  I read a review of these Audio Technicas and liked the reviews and price.  They arrived today and I have been giving them a good test with my favorite music.\n\nI am very pleased with the sound quality.  Very clear with good bass.  For this price?  I am very pleasantly surprised.  I have listened to other wired headphones that are over $100 and these are just as good in my opinion."}
{"review":"Comfortable, sound wonderful, and plus they have a long straight cord that stays straight.  The cord is about 15 feet so no need for an extension.  Bass is very good and fit, look and everything about them is good.  They sound great too!  I don't think anyone would be disappointed in these.  I liked them so much I bought an extra pair for work."}
{"review":"I'm no audiophile but I do like these headphones.  We use these on our home computer.  We listen to a lot of music and play games.  They are hooked up to a Sound Blaster X-FI Titanium.  They've worked great so far."}
{"review":"The sound on these headphones is superb, as is the fit. I can wear these for extended periods with no discomfort. I only have two minor gripes. The padding on the ears feels pretty flimsy, like it's going to flake off or tear eventually. Also the cord is way too long. Still, you can't beat these for the price."}
{"review":"I use these headphones everyday at work. They block out background noise and the music is amazing. I actually bought a second pair for my husband they were so great."}
{"review":"As all the other reviews mentioned, this has some pretty decent sound quality. Not a big audiophile so I can't really go into great details, but generally the quality of the sound is like what all the majority of the reviews say.\n\nThe downside to these pair of headphones is the comfort. If you have slightly big ears, then these headphones will be very uncomfortable for you. I had these for about a week, and after wearing them for about an hour or less, my left ear will be hurting. I thought the depth of the earpads would've been the same as the M50's that my housemates have, but they're not. So for those with slightly larger ears, I would not recommend these."}
{"review":"...weak. I purchased these on reading the reviews and, to be fair, many of them did state that the phones are weak. I just had to see for myself. They are, after all, full headsets so I don't think the manufacturer was expecting them to be used on portable players. Even on my PC however, I have no problem listening to them at 100%, something that I can't do with my Koss Portapros. I usually need to turn those down a notch or two.\n\nThey do sound very nice though, reproducing sound clearly along the entire spectrum. Very nice bass, which is important to me. I think I'll keep these as my home phones and make the Portapros portable full time."}
{"review":"As others have mentioned, these have a great sound and are extremely comfortable over a long period of time. The cord and plug seem especially well built, I'm not too concerned with breaking these as I have been with other similar makes.\n\nThat said, I bought these to use at work. In a fairly open work space, they oddly seem to cut white noise but amplify other people's voices. Turning up the volume high enough will avoid this, but it was kind of a bummer as I use headphones to get work done when others are having lively debates in close proximity."}
{"review":"Pros:\n\n- Decent sound quality. These aren't an audiophile's dream, but the treble is clear, the mids pleasant, and the lows are well-defined.\n\n- The headphones are fairly comfortable, and I don't have issues wearing them hours at a time.\n\n- With these and some low-volume, whiteish noise (like rainymood.com), I can block out the gross majority of distracting sounds at work.\n\n- Only one wire on the side, which makes them a bit easier to take off.\n\nCons:\n\n- Not being able to adjust the height of the back; a minor annoyance.\n\nOverall, completely happy with this purchase."}
{"review":"Sound is good.\nFit is tight. I wear a 7 5\/8 hat.\nThe cups sit on the edges of my ears, but I'm a dumbo. I tried the M50 and they aren't much better, if at all. I couldn't do a side by side comparison, but they looked like they were the same size.\n\nFor the price, these are legit."}
{"review":"I will keep this quick since I'm not an audio professional nor do I pretend to be one.  I was simply looking for a decent pair of headphones to block out surrounding noise at work while providing above average musical quality.  I got exactly what I wanted and more.  The extra length on the cord was also a bonus so I no longer accidentally pull the plug from the computer and everyone around me jumps at my screaming music.\n\nGood buy, I would highly recommend."}
{"review":"I listen to special CDs for brain entrainment.  They require closed ear headphones and I want comfort.\n\nThese provide comfort and high sound quality.  The cord is long, a plus for me, but maybe not for other people.\n\nThese replace some Sony ones I had. I use them in the computer and in our MP3 player, as well."}
{"review":"I had a set of noise canceling headphones that my son broke. I bought these to replace them and I couldn't be happier! I can hear things in music that I have owned for years that I never noticed."}
{"review":"Up front, plain and simple, the Audio-Technica ATH-M30 headphones are a steal for what Amazon is charging.  As of this writing, they're a hair over $40.00, and they're worth every penny.  Despite all the gushing I'm about to do here, I'm giving these a 4-star review based on the idea that these are a real bargain for the price but you can, for four times the price, buy cans that put these to shame.  That's the short version of this review, but if you more details, read on.\n\nFor your edification, I'm a 30-year-old male.  I've spent a lot of my life listening to different music, from classical to rap to jazz, but I've listened the most to 1970's and 1980's-style guitar-heavy rock (think Van Halen, Joe Satriani, Rush).  I also thoroughly enjoy Radiohead and Ben Folds, and I've been going through a dubstep phase of late.\n\nFrankly, I have limited experience in high-quality headphones, but I can tell you what I've stacked these M30's up against in the last few days and how I think they compare:\n\n1) Versus cheap Sansa earbuds that came with a low-end MP3 player: There is no comparison.  Not in the same class, not on the same planet, not in the same universe.  The earbuds are an utter joke compared the M30's, and it is these very M30's that caused me to throw away my earbuds last night.  I refuse to go back to them after listening to the M30's.\n\n2) Versus&nbsp;:  You might be saying, \"but you need ear buds for their form factor in some situations.\"  Not after trying these in-ear headphones, you don't.  For around 7 dollars, these are pretty solid.  With some EQ to bring up the bass frequencies, these are really nice for the price.  I don't think I would ever go back to regular earbuds after hearing these, but, still they sound very \"flat\" in the mid- and high-frequency ranges and lack brightness, but for what they are I am really impressed with them.  Perfect for the treadmill or mowing the lawn (please wear over-hear projection on top of these if you mow in them).\n\n3) Versus&nbsp;:  It starts to get interesting here.  I just bought these Panasonic's a couple weeks ago.  I was trying to find my first pair of acceptably good headphones because I'd never owned headphones much better than what came with a Sony Discman.  I've loved music my whole life, and somehow my cheapness had gotten the best of me; I finally realized it was worth spending more than $10 on a pair of headphones that would sound fuller, reproduce music more accurately, and hopefully last more than a couple months.\n\nI did a lot of research and found the RP-HTX7 had a LOT of VERY positive reviews, so I chose them over the Sennheiser HD202's, which are very highly regarded for the price at just a few dollars less than these Panasonics.\n\nI was concerned that the fashionable look of the RP-HTX7 was at the expense of sound quality, and, sure enough, this was one of the few times Amazon Reviews have failed me.  Compared to your standard cheap ear buds, these Panasonics are a good upgrade.  With a LOT of added bass from an equalizer, these are actually pretty good.  They do have good clarity in the high-mids, but the highest highs are a little on the tinny side.  Unfortunately, I don't intend to run EQ on everything I listen to through my headphones, and with no equalizer these Panasonics just have no warmth at all and are very low on the bass side.\n\nThe ATH-M30 has a monstrous leg up over the RP-HTX7 in sound quality for an upgrade of less than $10.  The M30's have strong bass that hits pretty hard for the price, and with EQ the bass can be made ridiculously strong.  There is just a tiny bit of added clarity that the Panasonic's have in the mid-highs over the M30's but it's not enough to detract in this price range.\n\nIn terms of comfort, the RP-HTX7 is below average to poor.  The ear cover padding is dense and unforgiving and the rubber creates a nearly airtight seal with the side of my head.  Within minutes, my ears are hot and sweaty.  The M30's immediately feel like a better build, and the padding and fabric are less firm and cooler than the RP-HTX7's.\n\nIf you care about the look, consider buying the RP-HTX7.  They used to sell for $60-$80 and now they go for around $30; that should tell you something.\n\nBut if you truly care about sound quality, you won't buy the Panasonic RP-HTX7.  You'll buy something else in the price range that actually sounds good.  For about $10 extra, these M30's fit that bill perfectly, but I would try to get my hands on some Sennheiser HD202's first (and hopefully some others, too) for your comparison before you commit to a particular set.  Personally, I'll be returning my RP-HTX7's in favor of the M30's.\n\n4) Versus&nbsp;:  To me, this is where it's interesting: $40 Audio-Technica's versus $300 Dre Beats Studio's.  A coworker of mine has the Studio's and I've been fortunate enough to try these back and forth against the M30's.\n\nI won't lie to you.  The Dre Beats Studio's are better.  The Studio's have a cleanness and clarity that the M30's cannot achieve.  They're significantly more comfortable, too.  They also cost 7 times as much, and the truth is I'd rather have 2 pairs of M30's and $200 in my pocket than 1 pair of Dre Beats Studio's.  That said, there are probably better $300 headphones than Dre Beats (e.g., Bose QuietComfort 15's) that would make this a tougher decision, but my point is for around $40 the ATH-M30's do remarkably well.\n\nOverall, the Audio-Technica ATH-M30 is a really reasonable buy for the price.  They are the best sounding headphones I now own but also the most expensive.  From my research, the next big jump up in quality is the ATH-M50 but at more than triple the price of the M30's I think it's a significant decision.\n\nCons?\n\n- My head is probably a little above average in width, and the M30's do push against the side of my head with noticeable force; it does create some pressure on the side of my head, and while it's not enough to be painful, I do hope they will loosen up with time.  I also can listen to these for an hour or two and my ears don't sweat like with the Panasonic RP-HTX7.\n\n- Not every song sounds terribly clean through these.  There is some mud in the mids and mid-highs, especially if you have gobs of bass coming through at the same time.  This is one of the things you improve on when you start spending $100+ on a set of cans, and while that day may come for me, I'm not there yet.\n\n- Cord is not removable.  They say you get what you pay for, and it's true, but this is a big one.  These headphones come with an 11-foot non-interchangeable cord.  For my own use, this isn't a huge deal because I just roll up the cord and contain it with a twist tie while I sit at a desk, but for some people I can imagine this would be a significant frustration.\n\nFor better or for worse, the Audio-Technica ATH-M30's are the first set of headphones I've owned where I could easily pick out a good quality MP3 rip from a bad one.  I'm afraid I'm going to have to re-rip all my 160k MP3's at 256k or go to FLAC.  With these headphones, you can pick out all those backing vocals you couldn't hear before, all those accompanying instruments and fine touches you didn't even know were there before.  But I can hear the imperfections from bad editing jobs now, too, so choose your poison, I guess.\n\nThey say ignorance is bliss, and I can't un-know how good these are for the price, but the fact is that I will never go back to bad headphones again.  Good sound quality is something you can appreciate throughout your entire life, and these headphones are more than worth the price of admission."}
{"review":"So if your into super long cords that you could probably hang yourself with this is the product for you. I am not so much into that style of product but the headphones themselves are amazing. The sound quality is excellent and you hear everything well. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because after wearing them drafting for 2 hours they started to hurt my ears. it felt like a \"pressure\" feeling. But I was also wearing them for an extended period of time. The cord is too long for my taste i had to bunch it up and zip-tie the bad boy but if the cord was cut down by about a good 5 ft they would be perfect. I love audio technica products"}
{"review":"These things are better than most of the 70-200 dollar \"style\" headphones out there. They won't win you any style point, but you will definitely be able to hear things you couldn't before."}
{"review":"Unfortunately I was only able to wear these for about an hour before they became painfully uncomfortable.  I adjusted and re-adjusted them with no luck over several days.  I've since ordered another pair that sit around the ear and I've already worn them for several hours at a time.\n\nThese also took quite a bit of \"fine-tuning\" to get a decent to moderate sound out of.  I say that because I was very unhappy with the level of distortion, especially if listening to any music with heavy bass.\n\nThe only reason for 2 stars is that even though they are extremely uncomfortable for me, you can tell that they are well made, and they are very comfortable to wear around your neck due to the foldable cups."}
{"review":"Very affordable headphones. They feel very durable and are extremely comfortable for long listening sessions. Highs are crisp, lows aren't too bassy, and with a little EQ tweaking, they sound incredible. Probably the best over\/on ear headphones i've ever owned."}
{"review":"I would like to say for the price you are getting great quality headphones. You can hear every detail clearly and the bass is also great.\n\nOnly bad thing about these headphones is that after wearing for hours it starts to feel tight and hurts a bit. Also many people complain about the pads but mines have not fallen off yet. Good sign. Great addition to my studio."}
{"review":"I purchased this bout a week ago and so far im impressed. I had to replace my sennheiser HD 202 headphones and I was skeptical about these but these are way better, I use them for making beats late at night, I got them connected to my behringer xenyx 802 mixer which has a headphone amp built in and these headphones are slamming, I would buy them again"}
{"review":"My usual go to headphones are Sony MDR-V150, but I started getting tired of those and looked into something better. These headphones have amazing sound and actually have some bass to them (unlike the Sony ones), it's not overpowering, but it's there when it needs to be with no distortion of the rest of the music. They fit great, ears don't get hot\/sweaty, and they don't push on your jaw (which is an issue for me with other headphones) so you can wear them all day if you wanted to.\n\nThe only con, but still a pro, is the cable length. 11ft. is a bit much, so if you take these when you're out and about, bring a rubber band or something to wrap up excess cable."}
{"review":"I've only had ear bud head phones before purchasing these. Listening to music through these instead of ear buds or the computer is such an amazing experience. The sound is superb. Especially for the price.\n\nHowever, when I was deciding which headphones to buy and reading through various reviews, I saw some that mentioned the long length of the cord. I thought it wouldn't be a big deal. However, it is incredibly inconvenient and I wish I would have heeded their warnings. I'm a student at university so I wear them walking between classes, and the cord is a huge hassle to deal with. Yes, I was aware they're for studio, but I thought it wouldn't be too big of a deal. Everything else about them is great. It usually takes hours before my ears start feeling slightly uncomfortable. I just wish I took the cord length more seriously. If I could redo my purchase, I would. But if you're looking for a long cord length, then these are wonderful."}
{"review":"These earphones are excellent for sound but I was surprised and a bit amazed that there is no way to regulate the loudness on the unit itself. You have to change it on the TV as you go from one TV station to another and on the Tuner\/CD player as you need to modify the loudness from CD to CD. For the price of this unit, sound control is a no-brainer. Kept the earphones, but really disappointed in the company for producing such a limited capability in a costly wired product."}
{"review":"Took these to work and use them every day. They have a really great sound and I can't really elaborate any better than any other audiophile that's already commented on these. All I know is I'm hearing stuff in my music that I've never heard before and it is awesome!"}
{"review":"Beats almost every other $50~ headphones.\n\nEverything that needed to be said, was said already by others, this is just editors pick of almost every audiophiliac in the market in the price range."}
{"review":"Good headphone with sturdy plastic construction. Great sound, but may not be for those seeking more bass. Can get very warm on the ears for prolonged use."}
{"review":"Extra long cord. Heavy duty plug with mini-to-1\/4 inch adapter. The Bass is so deep, without the whole headset being \"bassy\".\nSeparation and clarity are just as people are reviewing...incredible! These surpass yesterday's untouchably expensive phones!"}
{"review":"I purchased for my father who has hearing loss so he can plug into laptop.  He is a big guy with a big head and not complaints so working fine so far."}
{"review":"The sound reproduction, for my ears, is fantastic, and for the prize, they are unbeatable. They are sufficiently comfortable to make me unaware of their presence over my head."}
{"review":"I wear glasses and wanted some over-ear headphones so I could listen to videos, play games, and not disturb my husband. I had some semi-closed Sennheisers back when I was doing some audio production work and the sound quality on these is better, they are more comfortable to wear (have had no trouble wearing them to watch a 2 1\/2 hour movie), and I am very pleased with my purchase. My husband is happy I got them, too. (He uses on-ear earphones and they don't give me the sound I want unless I push them fully into my ears so they close the ear canal.) Now we're both happy and for the price, I feel I got a great product and a good value."}
{"review":"For the price....the best. I read a great review on Cnet and that led me to these. Really long high quality cord and plug. Comfort is so so."}
{"review":"First, I am not an audiophile and I have been using free\/cheap ear-bud headphones. But let me tell you, if you listen to music 1 or more hours a day and have 50 bucks to spare, don't even think twice!!! Since I am not an audiophile, I cannot give you a technical review. But I can't tell when I hear all different instruments in the songs I never heard with cheap headphones.\nMany people complained this headphones are too tight. I have a big head.., and I feel the headphones fit comfortably.\nMinor flaws are it is kind of sluggish to adjust and the swivel kind of swivels too freely. Also, this is not a big deal, but the packaging is not sealed and very easy to open and closed back, so I wouldn't know if this a used unit (it doesn't look like it though)\nNow I am thinking to get the ATH-A700 (U$140-160) for my home, and use this one for my office. Anyone knows if it is worth to spend that much money on A700?"}
{"review":"Before I bought these I tried about a dozen in all price ranges.  They are better than most and as good  as or better than some of tghe most expensive ones I tested.  I'm not an audiophile, but to me the sound quality is good across all frequencies.  I haven't worn them for more than 45 minutes at a time, but so far they are comfortable on the head and I have not experienced any discomfort."}
{"review":"Awesome product for the price, can hear things that i've never heard before in the music. Just a great buy altogether. Comes cheaply packaged, but the headphones are sturdy and very comfortable for extended use. Extra long thick cord, good quality build all around."}
{"review":"Nice sound and comfortable but this cord is crazy long for my use, which is primarily computer\/iPhone. Not a big problem. I just keep the extra wound up and secured with a twist tie.\nMost headphones have a hard time fitting comfortably over my ears on account of my lumpy head. Not these. Ear cups fit perfectly over my ears. However right now I wish they had a noise cancelling feature to drown out whatever pretentious euro drama the wife is watching. Luckily I can crank up my Audio-Technica ATH-M30s to almost dangerous levels without distortion. Woo Hoo!"}
{"review":"I have these hooked up to my asus xonar essensce stx sound card in my computer and they sound amazing. I was blown away. I originally got them to use just at work, but now they are my everything headphone.  I've had sennheiser 280 hd pros, which are about $100. The ath m30 beat them flat out and at half the price. My roommate has sennheiser hd 600s and they are on par with them. This is a great bargain headphone that will deliver high end audio. The build quality is exceptional and not what you would expect from a $50 headphone. They are very lightweight and have lots of padding making them very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. They have a simple, minimalist design that I love. The extra long cable is perfect, and the included quarter inch adapter is perfect to plug right into my sound card. I no longer have to use my headset's extension cable just to have them reach me from where my computer is. Overall great pair of headphones and very budget friendly."}
{"review":"I ordered this headset last week with another Panasonic one for my wife and both supposed to arrive in one package. 4 days ago, it said that package delivered, but Ive keept checking my mailbox and around my house and still nothing... tried to call carrier but useless :( just wasting..."}
{"review":"As a mother of teenage boys, I invested in buying these head phones so I could actually be in the house without losing my hearing... I borrowed one pair to do work on the computer while they were being loud in other ways - I could not hear them at all, and above everything, the sound was very nice, even the base came through strong. Obviously, I'm not an expert, but for a reasonably priced pair of head phones, I would definitely recommend these."}
{"review":"I rarely rate products, however I am very impressed with these headphones! I consider myself to be a bit of an audiophile- I've owned headphones from Bose and Klipsch, which were significantly more expensive than these headphones.\n\nThese headphones, unlike Bose and Klipsch, really strike a balance between bass and treble. For around $38USD, I really can't recommend them enough."}
{"review":"These were $35 when I bought them (don't know what they are now) and are worth every penny! The sound is incredible! The only downside is that the cable is about 11 feet long, so I have to use a cable tie to keep it all together. Aside from that, it's great! (Note: these headphones don't swivel)"}
{"review":"This pair of headphones sound really nice, i use them all the times, the cord is really long, could use them almost across the room, the tip is large so make sure that if your connecting them to your phone, your case should have a hole large enough to fit, the connector and cord feel very sturdy but the headphones them self use cheap plastic, they sound nice."}
{"review":"These headphones really work great. They have very nice sound and are comfortable to wear. Unlike some over the ear headphones they have very good bass. Thanks Santa"}
{"review":"No complaints at all.  These are the best.  Great price, great listening sound, and the most comfortable headphones you will ever wear guarenteed.  You can listen for hours with these on your ears and they will still feel as comfortable as when you first put them on.  Very well built!!  My family has a couple pairs of these headphones that they use for DJ\/Recording.  It's a great buy and you can't go wrong with these headphones.  I highly highly reccommend these Audio-Technica ATH-M30 Professional Studio headphones to anyone."}
{"review":"Been using them for 12 hours in a row now (very comfortable). By far the most crisp and clear sounding headphones I've heard for under $50. Last pair of headphones I bought were green and black from walmart and I thought for $50 I would get something decent. Couldn't stand them and after 3 months I decided I needed something new. Had my eye on the M50s but I don't have that much cash, and after I heard these I wouldn't have bought them anyway. Tested out the monsters, beats and bose head phones through friends and family. I think the others charge you mostly for advertising, these sound the same as those (biggest difference for me seemed to be the source, a lot of difference between a crappy computer and a nice audio card).\nThey also work fine in noisy environments, but they aren't noise canceling. Just simple and great quality."}
{"review":"Great headphones. Great sound quality, though the cord is really long. Great for musicians? but cumbersome for regular use. I would give this 5 stars if the cord wasn't so long. Looks to be solidly made."}
{"review":"These Audio-Technica's have blown me away. I wanted something with decent noise canceling ability and that would sound great for listening to music on my computer as well as recording podcasts, Garageband tracks, vocals, etc. Look no further! Yes, there are better products out there but your ear doesn't need it and I'm sure your wallet could spend the money you saved elsewhere. It is everything I expected."}
{"review":"I bought this headphone from Amazon. I owned it for about 2 weeks. I decided to write a review\n\nPro:\nSound very clear.\nOutput sound seems stable, even when I move around - good cable.\nMaterial is good and sturdy, doesn't looks cheap, doesn't feel cheap.\nBass is good and deep.\nIt grips your head firmly.\n\nCons:\nThe ear muff seems a bit small for my ears, but I have a bigger than average ears :-)\n\nIt's a buy recommendation from me"}
{"review":"I would give 5 stars for sound quality and 4 stars for comfort.  I immediately tried these cans on after receiving them from the mail lady.  These hurt when I first put them on.  They squeezed my jaw bone just below the ear.  Very disappointed but decided to try them anyway figuring that the tension might give over time. This was a totally new and amazing experience watching a movie on my IPad2.  I found myself completely immersed in the movie like nothing I have ever experienced before.  Made some adjustments to the cans on my head and was able to take some of the pressure off of my jaw bone.  By the way, I have a very normal size head in my opinion.\n\nI'm happy to say that after using these for about two days the pressure on my upper jaw bone is about a 3 on a scale of 10 compared to a 8 out of 10 when I first tried them on.  I realized that part of the initial tightness of the cans was due to the cold weather when they arrived.\n\nThe Cord:\n\nPros:  Quality is the first thing that comes to mind.  Long enough to plug into my home theater receiver and sit on the couch to enjoy a movie without disturbing anyone else in the house.  An adapter was included that allowed me to plug into the receiver.\n\nNegatives:  Very heavy.  Can be bulky at times.  Not good for moving around because there is simply too much cord to tuck away.  If you plan on being very mobile with these it could be annoying.\n\nThese do an amazingly good job of sound isolation at max or close to max volume on my IPad.  Listening to these at max volume on the IPad is a pleasure and not over-the-top. At mid volume I would say the sound isolation is ok.\nThe sound I am referencing is coming from a household with 1 and 4 year old boys.  Which I'm pretty sure they are kicking off some pretty high decibels.\n\nOverall I would say that these are more than worth the money.  The experience you receive in watching movies is something else!  Like I said, the sound pulls you in to the movie."}
{"review":"I use it for both the digital piano when I want to play piano at night and don't wake up anyone.  And also use it with my computer for music listening or gaming.  And for all of those, this headphone performs well.  Sound quality isn't Bose level.  But I don't think most people will notice the difference.  This headphone has great clarity.\n\nHowever, there's a better value.  There's a headphone from Monoprice which you can also purchase from Amazon for less than $30 and I feel that other headphone is a better value.  It sound at least as good as this one if not better at half the price.  Cnet also gave great review for it.  I purchased the Monoprice headphone and am also happy with it.  I'd give that headphone 5 stars due to quality and value.  I'm talking about the sound quality though.  Build quality is much better with this headphone as Monoprice is built cheap but very comfortable."}
{"review":"After wearing them for just 1 hour you ears feel cramped Most of the pro headphone cost much more A person needs to try them out before buying to get good ones !!! Kinda like shoes you need to make sure they fit right !!!!"}
{"review":"I recently got these and so far they sound amazing, very clear sound. I am currently breaking them in with the JLabs burn in website, so im sure they will sound better after that. I went from Sennheiser HD202's and the difference is distinct, there is more detail in my music and its not as muffled. Of course, the most important aspect is your audio equipment at home. I just got these for my PC, and I will soon put my Creative Sound Core sound card in and will update the difference. That card has a dedicated headphone amp. I think for the price these are a great buy, they are comfortable and affordable. The cord actually isn't as long as the HD202's it replaces, and its a very nice cord. All in all a good set.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThese headphones paired with my amplified Sound Blaster Recon sound amazing it can get so loud I have to keep my computer at half volume, and its so clear, I highly recommend these headphones to anyone on a budget. Arguably best headphones for this price range."}
{"review":"Music and movies sound great. But on an airplane it does not silence the outside noise 100%. I bought it on sale and was satisfied with it's value."}
{"review":"I received 2 shipments that were not completely sealed in that heavy plastic.  The first I received had a slit on the edge, but the back.  The second set did not even have the plastic back at all, and still with the rough edges.  Even if great, I want a completely sealed product where I don't think it was previously used.  Company\/distributor issue?"}
{"review":"I've been using cheap headphones for years. They have all either worn out or have been broken. This year I decided that I'm going to be taking my music creation more serious and start investing in some better equipment. I figured I add to my studio in the following order, a good pair of studio monitor headphones, a condenser microphone and a good set of monitor speakers. I started this month with the headphones.\n\nI did a lot research for headphones under $100.00, looking at Sony V6's, KRK's KNS6400's, ATH's M40FS's and a few others. I finally settled on these. For the prices and the amount of good reviews I decided to give them a try. Let me start by saying I'm hearing things in my music I've never heard before in any headphones I've ever used! Now don't get me wrong I'm sure there are better and more expensive headphones out there but for something to get me started these will certainly fit the bill.\n\nThe M30's have a nice finish and fit. I have smaller ears and they fit inside the padded cups just fine. I also wear glasses and so far wearing them with the headphones haven't bothered me at all like many of the cheaper headphones I've used in the past. I like the long cord because that's how I've broken many pair of phones in the past. The would get snagged on something and instant cord ripped out. The extra long cord will be a welcomed upgrade. The sound quality is amazing. I'm hearing high's and low's that I didn't know were there so the frequency response is great!\n\nBy all means I'm no audio engineer and I'm just getting started with mixing and back into recording but these headphones sound truly amazing to me and I'm sure I'll be using them for a long time!"}
{"review":"Not bad for the price.  Sound is good, but I was hoping for more.  My old Bose headphones are 4+ years old (bought them for less than $100) and they sound MUCH better than these.  But these are comfortable and the cord is LONG so I can use it watch TV or play video games without waking up people in the house."}
{"review":"It may not isolate ambient noise real well but the sound is great.  Very comfortable - I have a small head & it still fits me very well.  I can wear it for hours.  I use it for voice recording & it does very well with good response bass to treble."}
{"review":"Audio-Technica has an excellent reputation in the headphone industry. The phones are quite comfortable and I have worn them for up to 6 hrs. without fatigue. The extra length 10 ft cord has a strain relief at both plug and phone end, and I can reach from the receiver to my easy chair without using an extension.  Sound is natural, not overly bright, but it is lacking a bit of bass."}
{"review":"I wanted these headphones for the gym but I didn't know the wire was going to be so long but other than that these headphones are great to  hear at home"}
{"review":"Great sound quality and comfort.  However, these headphones don't work with Ipod Gen 3 or earlier models.\nIt would have been helpful to know this before the purchase."}
{"review":"I'm not a audiophile but compared to my previous headphones this are one of the best headphones I've ever had.  The sound is crystal clear  and it has good bass plus they are comfortable to wear for a long time."}
{"review":"This is the 3rd pair and not because they are so great but they work OK for the price.  Remember you always get what you pay for and if you buy cheaper head phones then you get what you pay for."}
{"review":"I almost return it. I was using it on my computer and the sound was disappointed until I recalled someone said it needed to burn for a few hours. I left it play for two nights; on the second day i was amazed to hear the sound increased in volume; and when i set up the equalizer on my computer, wow wow"}
{"review":"I realized I could still hear the high end sounds when I listened to music using the various head phones at best buy.  I was not about to pay over 200$ though.  Looked at the reviews on Amazon and found these.  Sound just as good to me.  Very happy.  Comfortable and somewhat noise canceling.  Would recommend to a friend."}
{"review":"Really good at noise canceling in a room (such as when a portable room heater kicks on) and the sound quality is very good. Only complaint is that they fit a bit tight, but this could be because they are still new, and the old ones we had were held together by duct tape (a little too loose). But overall, no complaints and they work as advertised."}
{"review":"Couldn't be happier with my purchase.  I am picky with audio but I found these headphones delivered great sound at a reasonable price.  One of the plastic ear cans will rotate and hit the other if you quickly remove the unit from your head.  Still a great product and I would purchase again."}
{"review":"Bought these a present, Im a amateur audiophile myself, and wanted everyone at home to feel a light Audiophile experience.\nEvery1 has been very impressed by the headphones, stating: <<I can hear things i never heard before>>\nor the funny: <<I thought he said that but it was actually...>>\nIt hit the spot and made every1 happy, I haven't tried the build quality, but it seems far from a cheap build.\nIt is very comfortable also, the only thing in contact with your ears \/ head is the cushion."}
{"review":"Works great for my son who uses them to listen to music when gaming on the computer.\nThey are comfortable and light weight - and the price is great.\nDon't spend a ton of money on the 'headset of the hour' when you can purchase and use these."}
{"review":"I use these for studio headphones when practicing my guitar.  These head phones have a long cord which lets me me moble and are very comfortable to wear for hours.  I've been very happy with my purchase."}
{"review":"It sounds very comfortable and is higher quality just the appearance are not so beautiful some others. I am not a professional one, it is valuable for me to use on subway!"}
{"review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said. For the price you're going to pay for these headphones how can you possibly go wrong? I know some say they have bad sound and and others say they are uncomfortable but isn't that all subject to personal taste and the fact we all have different head sizes and different size ears? I'm one of the the vast majority that think these are truly amazing headphones. I listen to mostly Metal and I mean Death, Black, Doom and all the other sub genres of Metal and like I said these things truly ROCK!!! I have absolutely no problem with the amount of bass they produce. I do listen to high quality FLAC files so that helps alot. Anyway, I don't claim to be an audiophile but I due know what I like and that is the sound of these headphones. I would make one suggestion and that would be to get a small portable headphone amp to put between these and your smartphone or iPod. Its not a must but you will be doing yourself a huge favor. I know this isn't the most technical review but I sure hope it helps somebody. Once again, great cans for the money."}
{"review":"These headphones are Better than Bose, Dr. Due and others.  These have Highs, Mids, and Lows.  Great Sound Quality.  I will be buying more of these for friends and family. Earbuds are bad for your ears they just blast Highs and mids in your ear causing you to go deff in a few years.  The sound is trapped in your ear and no where for it to go.  With these Audio-Technica Headphones the Sounds can go around your ears and not get the sound trapped in your ears."}
{"review":"If you're looking for an inexpensive pair of headphones (not earphones), these are easily the best-sounding in their price range. Audio-Technica, I contend, has the best value headphones in every price range. The cords are a bit long though..."}
{"review":"Almost as good as my Bose headphones. My grandson wanted some just like my Bose headphones\nSo these worked. My daughter says the entire family appreciates them!"}
{"review":"Ordered online, due to many positive customer reviews.  I was not disappointed. Comfortable, durable and long cable (which I have already stepped on), great sound, nice bass. I felt I needed to add a positive review, good headphones for the price."}
{"review":"These headphones are freaking great if you are mixing, every sound is amazingly razor sharp. The problem is, if you grew up on cheap headphones, the crispness feels like it over-shadows bass guitars and most bass your used to \"feeling\" on cheap phones; if that makes any sense.\n\nThey aren't kidding when people joke about bass guitars been turned down in respect to most band instruments, these headphones show that. They are that sharp."}
{"review":"I bought these with a gift card that I got for Christmas. I have several pairs of more expensive \"high end\" headphones from different manufacturers that always seem to end up in use by my wife and kids....So I wanted a pair just for me. The price was reasonable, the reviews good, and I am familiar with the AT brand. They arrived 2 days early and were well packaged. The first thing I noticed when I unpacked them was the outstanding quality of material and craftmanship. Extremely light weight, but not at all flimsy or cheap feeling. The chord is extra long and very well made with stress relief at the plug end. It also came with a screw-on 1\/4\" adapter plug. Listening to music is a pleasure, the light weight and padding make them extremely comfortable. The sound, even at low level is clean and crisp. Music, talking, nature sounds, gaming, all give the impression that the sound is not coming from headphones (kind of hard to explain it). These are the best headphones, by far, that I own. For the price, I would argue that you cannot buy a better set of headphones."}
{"review":"These headphones feel great on your head even after a few hours.  They are very, very adequate for most everyday use but could certainly be used by media professionals as well.\n\nLong cord, good connector and they feel pretty durable as well.  I would highly recommend these.  The only minor complaint I have is that they tend not to squeeze onto your head very tight, which makes them more comfortable, but at times they tend to slip off the back of my head, especially if i'm on a couch.  But for the most part they are very comfortable and form fitting.  5\/5 Stars."}
{"review":"When I purchased these, they were around $40, a very good price\/performance ratio. At $60, its only decent. I regret not having paid much attention to the 11 foot cord - it is very bothersome, annoying, and frustrating...it always dangles, definitely not for portable use...Anyways, the overall sound quality is...how should I say this...\"respectable\", but lacks in some aspects. At times, the sound quality is not as clear as I would like it to be, and the different background instruments are hard to differentiate and sounded a little muddy. I'm amazed how some people say these phones can rest on their heads for hours without discomfort. I have tried adjusting the length to various sizes, but I can never leave these phones on for more than an hour. Any longer, and my ears start to get really, really sore...I can always feel pressure on some part of my ear, either the top or the bottom, and these phones clamp down fairly tightly. The handband is a little on the big side, although that part at least rests comfortably on my head. On the downside, I get the feeling sometimes that the sound is trapped inside my head...These headphones are fairly comfortable for the first hour or so, but any longer, they start to cause discomfort. One aspect I liked was the thick, albeit long, cable, which is very durable. Overall, there is only a moderate sound quality improvement on these headphones compared to apple stock earphones, and not really any significant improvements. At $40, I would definitely buy them, but at $60, I would wait for the price to go down a bit..."}
{"review":"I'm not a professional musician or sound technician\/mixer by any count.  However, I am in a band and wanted a good quality headphone to be able to better hear all the different parts in a song.  Earbuds tend to miss the finer details of what's being played.  These, on the other hand, play everything.  I can hear exactly how many instruments are playing, what they're playing, vocals, harmonies, everything.  The sound isolation is fantastic.  I could not hear people 3 feet away from me talking.  The only reason I'm giving these 4 stars instead of 5 is that the playback is not quite as loud as I would like.  I still have to turn the volume up to half its maximum to be able to really hear everything.  However, well worth it for what I get to hear."}
{"review":"The headphone sound is super for the price. Did not like the extremely long cord. My son wanted to use it while running for conditioning for wrestling. Too long of a cord for that. We returned the product. The price and product was great. Just not good for this application. Thanks."}
{"review":"The set is very comfortable and comes with a good long cord which I like because it allows me some movement. The sound is good and the set is a great value."}
{"review":"These headphones are quality for a great price..I would definitely buy again. I own an old pair of Sony MDR100s that I love but they are on their last legs after 10 years. The sound is crystal clear and the headphones themselves are very comfortable. To be honest, the picture makes them look like they go OVER your ears and envelop them, but they are smaller than I pictured them and they actually rest on your ear. I think they are more comfortable than the MDR100s though. Also, I was really surprised by how LIGHT they are!! You can hardly feel them on your head.  They have a really nice headphone jack too; there is a coiled spring around the last 1-2\" of cord that keeps it from bending more than it should and risking pulling out whatever connectors are underneath. The cord is a little long for my personal preference but I wouldn't mark them down for it.\n\nAll in all, a very worthwhile sub $50 set of headphones!"}
{"review":"Arrived in good condition and provides a clean crisp sound. Good buy.\nThese are quality output and have comfortable fit, the only thing that could be better is if they were lighter, but they really are nice and not much more than the one's sold at bargain basement outlets."}
{"review":"Wow, what a difference decent quality headphones make. I was listening to an old pair of Sony cans, and these are so much better. I find they sound better and better the more I listen. I have about 100+ hours on them now, and am very satisfied with the sound. Even using the stock soundcard from the PC, these headphones will make your music sound better. Adding an external or higher end DAC and headphone amp makes these shine even more.\nI grabbed these for about $40 and they are worth every penny and much more. The build is solid, nice strong (and long) cord and connectors. No complaints."}
{"review":"I received these the other day and they are great.  The sound is crisp and the bass is nice and deep.  My only gripe is that they do not block out a lot of noise.  I know these aren't noise cancelling however I expected a little more isolation.  Other than that the sound quality is incredible for the price."}
{"review":"I purchased on October 2, 2011.  They died about 10 days ago--Dec 2012.  Just stopped working.  I'm going to contact Audio-Technica and see what their 2-year warranty does.  I already know I'm supposed to pay for return shipping--which I really don't want to do for a pair of $45 headphones.  I think it would probably just be cheaper for everyone concerned to just send a replacement set of phones rather than spend bench time repairing them and shipping them back--but I don't know.\n\nI'll report back on the warranty experience.\n\nThe headphones themselves are \"OK\" and not much more.  Not great audio, but for the price not much expected and adequate to the purpose I use them for.  Relatively comfortable with a LONG cord, which actually is quite handy.\n\nUPDATE-December 18, 2012:\n\nI called Audio Technica and spoke with the warranty department.  I wanted to see if they would accommodate me on dropping their requirement for paid return shipping to qualify for warranty service.  I told him that I didn't want to invest another $10-15 shipping costs on a pair of $45 phones that had already failed prematurely.  Before I had even finished, he immediately jumped in and said that I could either follow the warranty procedure or not.  When I mentioned that I would be reporting my experience on both the purchase and my experience here, he blew a gasket and told me that he didn't respond to \"coercion\" and went on a mini-rant without letting me speak at all, then hung up the phone.  Maybe he was having a really bad day, or maybe he thinks AT's warranty policy is just fine as-is?  He also seems to be confused about the difference between coercion and negotiation--or a consumer standing up and communicating dissatisfaction with their products and their customer service.\n\nI'm going to check with the UPS store on cost of returning, but at this point, I think the recycling bin or Goodwill will get these phones.  Amazon and other vendors have spoiled me with policies of standing behind products 100%, no questions asked (REI is a great example).  I won't be purchasing any Audio Technica products in the future.\n\nCC: President of Audio-Technica Corporation\n\nUPDATE: UPS wants $14.45 to ship back, which is close to 1\/3 the cost of the phones, so I won't be having them repaired under warranty at this point.  If I hear anything back from the company president, I'll update again.\n\nUPDATE: February 1, 2013.  USPS charged $8.50 to send back, so I did so.  They're back now and seem to be as good as new, which is fine if they can make it longer than 1 year this time."}
{"review":"Best pair of over ear headphones I've had. Sounds good and super comfortable. The cord is all kinds of long, you could jump rope with it..."}
{"review":"I have had these for about a year. I also have M35.\nPOOF! no sound! I have never had a pair of headphones to go out completely. Some had shorts in the wire. Some fizzled. Never POOF! No Sound!"}
{"review":"I like to listen to things loud while I'm working sometimes, but don't want to disturb the other cubicle inhabitants. These work great. I even asked someone if they could hear my music when I had it cranked up - They were right next to me & said they couldn't.\n\nThey are pretty comfy - though I do wish they could go a little smaller (but I have this issue with all headphones and headsets... I need little kid ones), but it's do-able for me, unlike many of this style. I wear glasses too - so that's good to note.\n\nSound quality is great & the length of the cord is awesome.\n\nAlso, I like the little flexible bit on the end where it plugs in."}

{"review":"Bought these so i could listen to music and movie audio on my laptop. Comfortable around the ears and eliminates most noise. No Bose headphones but work fine for the price"}
{"review":"Absolutely love these headphones. They arrived a day early of their expected delivery date. So far they're doing great. Pretty decent noise-cancelling, great sound (I'm not really an audiophile so I don't know what qualifies as great sound quality but they're great for me). The only aspect of these that I have any qualms with is the ridiculously long cable\/wire thing, but then again these are for musical instruments so I understand. Anyway as of now I'm completely satisfied."}
{"review":"I love the bass on these headphones; not too overpowering, but still pretty strong. I noticed a lot of other reviewers had said that the right\/left side shorted out. That happened to me once, but the next time I put them on, it was gone, and it hasn't happened since. I've had these for a good 6 months or so, and they've held up well. Admittedly, I am no audiophile, but these are infinitely better than my cheap Apple earbuds..."}
{"review":"Awesome headphones, it blocks out noise from the background.\nPretty good qualities. the only drawback would is that ears hurt if you wear this headphones for a long time (3+ hours, lol) @@"}
{"review":"These muffs are beautiful for the money.  I had pretty much assumed I blew out a series of ranges from nights at the gun range and concerts but even YouTube videos sound amazing in contrast to the $30 headsets I had been using.  They're not the most comfortable pair of muffs I tossed on but dollar for dollar the quality is impressive.  If I knew what I was missing at this price range I would have bought these years ago."}
{"review":"When at work I like to listen to news and podcasts, and the inner-ear buds always seem to give me a headache after a while. I want something that would fit over my ears comfortably and not interfere. These are great.\n\nDon't expect booming bass that shakes your head, but sound is crisp and clear.\n\nThe cord is insanely long, and while I sit at my desk with my computer or phone in front of me - I could see this being useful in some sort of a studio setup where you move around a lot.\n\nWould buy again."}
{"review":"I use these for movies on my fire. They do well all around, however there is  bad clipping with explosions and other high bass sounds. The kindle does this without the headphones too. No issues at all for music and they are very comfortable."}
{"review":"I'm very picky when it comes to sound quality. These have amazing sound quality, definitly the best headphones I've ever purchased for its price.\nI've had them for about a month and I listen to music very often, and usually turned up to the highest volume. They aren't the loudest headphones but they make up for it in clarity, plus they haven't blown yet and i don't believe they will anytime soon. Perfect for DJs :D"}
{"review":"These headphones are amazing for the price. I realized I needed new headphones after my last plain flight. The cheap headphones I had were uncomfortable and began to hurt my ears after long periods of use. I wanted something that was comfortable with good sound quality. My coworker let me try his Audio Technica ATH-M50WH. They were amazing but a little more than i wanted to spend. After looking at reviews I decided to go with the ATH-M30. You couldn't beat the price. The sound quality is awesome. They are extremely comfortable. I have fallen asleep with them on several times with no discomfort. I am not a dj, so the cord is much longer then ill ever need it to be. Other then that I am very satisfied with the headphones and recommend them to anyone that wants great headphones and doesnt want to spend the money on the name dre beats."}
{"review":"I bought these to replace a smaller Sony set that got broken. I was impressed with the sound quality, very clear indeed. As some reviewers stated, it could use more bass but still was enough for me while listening to music and watching movies on Netflix. It cancels out a lot of outside noise, I can hardly hear outside talking from 5 feet away. The ear pads are comfortable, a little tight but unless you have huge Dumbo ears like President Obama you shouldn't feel any pain or discomfort for watching the average length movie.\n\nI love the cord that attaches only to the left side of the headphones so it doesn't get in the way, like some 'stethoscope' designs that try to strangle you when you put them on. The longer cord is a plus and I can plug it into the back of our Vizio TV and still have enough cord length to watch TV if I wanted to (although I couldn't get it to work after plugging it into the audio, for some reason headphones will not work with our TV).\nCord length is about 10 feet, give or take. Overall very pleased with these with no batteries or impossible charging stations to worry about. Everything you need in a decent pair of headphones without all the earth-shattering bass that some people prefer with more expensive sets. For under $60 these were perfect.\n\nGave these 5 stars and hopefully they will last a long time.\n\nFor a more comprehensive review visit :\n\n[...]"}

{"review":"I recently changed from a home office to a cube and I needed a good pair of headphones for work. I've been using these headphones daily for three months, and I absolutely love them.  The sound is excellent, no matter what I am listening to.  They block out other noises in a office environment..  I wear glasses and even when I wear them six hours in a day, the headphones are comfortable.  The power cord is long and I can move anywhere in my cube without having to remove them."}
{"review":"The sound is top notch (mostly listened heavy metal and drum and bass), perfect isolation, but even though some reviewers found them very comfy, I somehow just can use them for one hour and after that the ears will be screaming with pain, and also they get a little sweaty too. Maybe is because they fit so tight that hurts, and that cannot be adjusted. Also if you plan using them outside with an ipod perhaps, beware with the extremely long cable that you would be carrying around."}
{"review":"Since I listen to a lot of recorded speech, clarity and definition are important,  These are the only 'phones under $100 that meet my requirements. Sound is sharp, clear & clean.  Most of the audio to which I listen is in foreign languages which need my criteria for good comprehension. I would assume the same criteria would be suitable for music too. Wearing the 'phones for a long time do not create a problem.  I would recommend these headphones based on Amazon's price and my required function. For me, they do the job well"}
{"review":"First impression right after purchase- 5 star: I got these for my child as an alternative to the in-ear buds and I have to admit I am surprised by the quality. The sound is clear and the noise cancelling is of a good quality considering the price. This is a good set of cans for an entry level listener.\n\nUpdate after 3 years of use- 1 star: these headphones pretty much fell apart after 3 years of occasional and careful use. The pad's thin material looks like it's been shredded, one of the plastic parts snapped."}
{"review":"They fit my head very comfortably.\nNo sore spots after hours of wearing.\nDurable enough to survive several trips on the bus stuffed into a backpack.\n\nOnly complaint is I get head set hair 'cus I wear them for so long :)"}
{"review":"I purchased these to replace my previous earbuds (in-ear ear buds) that were amazing already. I had V-Moda earbuds, and they rocked. However, at a certain point, things break, so I needed new ones. I decided to try to get great headphones\/earbuds, while trying to keep it cheap. I dig a lot of digging, comparing prices and features, stats and reviews. After a couple of days of looking at all the different possibilities, I decided to buy these. I have never regretted it. The audio quality of these headphones just blows everything else out of the water. Before you doubt them, or me, listen to some actually high quality songs with many musical aspects (a bunch of sounds), and then listen to the same song with something else. You will notice the quality difference immediately. The bass comes through clearly and strong, but without overpowering or dampening the high and mid-range sounds.\n\nTL;DR\n\nBUY THESE HEADPHONES."}
{"review":"I am quite pleased with these headphones. I admit to not being an audiophile freely, so those who are looking for an expert's opinion ought to look elsewhere. However, my unskilled ears were not horrified by what they heard. These headphones are serviceable, and well-made. They look good, and aren't too-cool-for-school, which I appreciate more and more as lately it seems even one's zippers must be unique and personalized in some way (sigh). They are comfortable, but if I wear my glasses, my head begins to ache a bit after a few hours. That's to be expected. A good price, a good product. Whoo-hoo."}
{"review":"These cans are fairly comfy, but I noticed a lack of bottom end almost immedaitely compared to my old cans which broke.  So of course I opened them up and noticed there was an RC low pass filter on the drivers. Red flag.  Apparently AT knows these things are a bit tinny and try to compensate by rolling off some of the top end.  so I swapped these drivers out for the drivers in my old cans, and now they sound great.  BTW, when I was looking at my drawer dwellers for drivers, I found a pair of AT drivers almost identical to the ones I swapped out, and at least a decade old!  Product improvement - not!"}
{"review":"I've spent a lot of time trying to find a great pair of cheap headphones, and the lists I read almost never mention the ATH-M30's. I've had these headphones for over a year and they still sound great and have shown no wear. There are a couple of things that aren't perfect about these cans, but for the price I think they are some of the best out their. The two main problems I have with the M30's is that the base can be a little underwhelming at times, and that the cord is too long. These are meant to be studio headphones so the cord length is to be expected, but it gets tangled pretty easily and is annoying to deal with. As far is the bass is concerned, these are much lower then beats by dre. but since they are more balanced by simply turning up the headphones a little I get the bass experience that I need"}
{"review":"These are AMAZING headphones. Wow. They make all music sound great. Granted, they may not be the best for mixing music do to that reason. I'll be mixing a song and it sounds brilliant, then I play the song in my car and, well, certain things are insanely loud, but I listen to the mix again through these and it sounds great. So, they take some getting used to, I'd say."}
{"review":"So, I guess I'm developing into an audiophile. Not an expert, but I've listened to my fair share of headphones. These aren't the most comforable for long term use and the cord is long (I would prefer a coiled version or option to switch out cords). However, the sound is fantastic and in a slim and compact package. Comfort or a thin profile are (as a rule) mutually exclusive and they went for profile in this case.\n\nI think I like these better overall than my Grado SR-60 and for less than half the price. The Grados mid and high range sound a little crisper than these cans, but the low end and build and comfort is hands down to AT. These were to wear at work and after a few hours my ears are pretty sore from these headphones. That said, I'm a happy camper and would recommend them to anyone, especially for <$40."}
{"review":"These are great headphones at a great price.  I purchased them for my wife for use with her practice organ and she is very happy with the sound quality and comfort of these headphones.  She loves the way they minimize outside noise as well. We highly recommend this product."}
{"review":"Not as professional as the ATH-M50s, but it's close.  With these headphones, you get three things: comfort, balanced sound, and a long wire.  Near perfect, I'll keep these around until I can afford better, more expensive ones."}
{"review":"I bought this headphones due to good quality sound and some good reviews about this product, they sound so good that a coworker bought me them as soon as I open the box in the office, he wanted them so bad that offer me the double that I have paid, for that reason I'm looking for the ATH-M50 now, jejejejejeje"}
{"review":"It is not easy to review headphones because everybody has his own taste in music and his style of music. However, I would say that this headphones will satisfy most of the users, especially considering the price. For price of 40 USD, it's a best buy!"}
{"review":"I have other headphones but this is the most expensive set I have to date, and I must say I was amazed at the sound.  They help keep out other sounds with the closed-back and the headband makes wearing them easier on the head than just plastic or wire on top.  Each earpiece can be turned out so you can talk or listen to something (or somebody) else.  They have a long cord, so while they may not be good for wearing outside, they allow movement inside the house or studio."}
{"review":"These are amazing headphones. Very comfortable, sound quality is amazing, long cable, not much else to say. I am more than happy that I picked these up. You should too!"}
{"review":"Just got the Audio-Technica ATH-M30 Closed-back Dynamic Stereo Monitor Headphones today, $47 on Amazon. Also, recently got the Able Planet Sound Clarity Active Noise Canceling Headphones, $75 at Costco (soon to be returned). The ATH-M30 are superior, there is no comparison. ATH-M30 has clear balanced audio, better construction, more comfortable, and surprisingly do a better job at noise cancelling than the Able Planet headphones--even though they are not listed as noise cancelling headphones. Able Planet also had a noticeable background hiss and I noted distorted audio when the cord was moved around. I use the headphones at work, I wanted decent affordable headphones that were comfortable with good audio that would also drown out the noise of my office environment. Do not hesitate to get the ATH-M30."}
{"review":"To begin with I am not an audiophile.  In fact I have hearing aids and wouldn't know quality sound response from a rifle shot.  I got these headphones to cancel out the noise coming from the community lunch table just outside my desk area at work.  For this purpose these headphones do a great job.  They comfortably fit over my ears.  I turn up the volume and I am in my own world free of the din outside my workstation.  The ear muffs are very comfortable and the cord is much stronger and thicker than expected.  For what I can hear, the sound coming from these headphones is great.  They are the nicest headphones I have ever owned, but this is coming from a guy who has never had anything better than the headphones that came with a Walkman."}
{"review":"These are a great pair of over-ear headphones. The sound is clean, nothing garbled\/muffled or anything. And I like the way they look, really simple and comfortable as well. Definitely a bargain, pull the trigger and get em, you won't be disappointed."}
{"review":"I our purchased these headphones based on previous experience with this brand but the sound quality was not very good. Very low volume even when turned up to the max."}
{"review":"Former musician....Kinda gave up on music for some years. Started to really listen to a lot of music a couple years ago after getting my smartphone, but only had crap headphones. Decided to get a decent pair, and did a lot of research. For my budget, these came out on top. I got an amazing deal on Amazon after looking in local stores and not finding them anywhere.\n\nI now have to re-train my ears. These are pretty accurate MONITOR headphones - very clean sounding, very balanced, not at all harsh or boomy. Light, comfortable for long periods of wear. Remind me of my Koss Pro 4A's that I had years (and years) ago."}
{"review":"So after reading many reviews decided on these headphones to get my feet wet.  I'm an aspiring songwriter and former musician.  By no means am I an audiophile so I can't give you detailed specifics on the headphones.  What I can tell you and what I was impressed with is the range of sound.  With normal headphones you might get good sound or really great volume, but the instruments all blend together.  With these headphones I am able to distinctly tell what instruments are being played.  The sound comes together very harmoniously without losing there specific identity.  So for me that is awesome!!!  One downside, they are not as loud as I would like.  One review I read said that these headphones would end up being a very expensive venture for him, because if the low end entry level cans sound this good, it only gets better moving up the scale.  I concur with that review and already have my eyes on a couple other headphones."}
{"review":"I got them, they're OK. Too funny I ordered them after reading reviews...Tight fitting worried me but I said OK I'll try them. TRUST ME they are NOT tight fitting at all.  Sounds great!!! Cheap to the feel, hold them in hand they feel very cheap. Light weight, straight cord not coiled. You want a good pair of phones under $50 order these."}
{"review":"These headphones are better than I expected. Reviewers were doing some in depth scrutinizing of this item and I'm sure they're quite knowledgeable. However, for myself, this are great headphones with superb sound quality and comfort. I just received them so I can't really say much about durability but I am hoping it will last for a very long time. So far, I've just been using it for music at home and not outdoors. they are just amazing. the bass doesn't overwhelm the rest of the music like the dr. dre beats. these headphones really bring out the quality and details of the sounds coming through them. of course the price was just right, since i am a poor college student, I do like the finer things in life but for a lot less. i highly recommend these headphones."}
{"review":"I bought these because I had tried several other headphones, one costing $1500 and could not find a pair that offered good sound and was comfortable. These were inexpensive and the reviews were decent so I figured, what did I have to lose by trying them. The answer to that question is, shipping to and from Amazon.\n\nI cannot recommend them, even for $45.00."}
{"review":"I snagged these on sale, and not only do they sound great but they are extremely light.  My roommate has a pair of ATH-M50s that are a great deal heavier, and less portable.  For the day-to-day and walking around listening to music that I do, these are perfect headphones.\n\nOnly gripe is the extremely long cord, but a twist-tie or zip-tie to keep extra cable out of the way solves that problem."}
{"review":"I bought the headphones for $40.00 and they are your money's worth. From the amazing reviews I read I had very high expectations. The sounds quality is good and you can really hear the separation of all the instruments. I did expect higher sound quality compared to what I read in the reviews. But again the sound quality is not bad at all. The bass comes out very nicely and for classical music (which I listen to quite a lot) you really hear each note clearly.\nThere is considerable amount of sound leakage and the person next to you can clearly hear the music. The noise-canceling capability is pretty low.\nThey headphones themselves have leather around them, they are soft and padded considerably so they are comfortable. But after sometime of wearing my ears hurt from the periphery. Maybe I just have large ears, lol. The cord that they come with is pretty long and that can be advantageous for some but its a bit inconvenient for me. The cord itself is smooth, soft and sturdy.\n\nOverall, I am ok with the quality and satisfied with the headphones given the price I payed. But I will look into purchasing another set in the future.\n\nUday"}
{"review":"Pros:\n  These pair of headphones sound great!  They are extremely balanced and they do a great job at letting you know just what is going on in a piece of music or at the studio.\n  The cord is long enough to strangle a troll, and that really helps just in case you're one of those people that use headphones when they use their desktop, because it means that you don't have to get up to turn the light off, do get something to eat, or drive to Wal-Mart.\n  The plug is very well made with a screw-on type 1\/8\" to 1\/4\" adapter that are gold-plated for conductivity purposes, and the stress-relief system is nice.\n\nCons:\n  These headphones may get a bit uncomfortable after using them for a while if you wear glasses, and the frame may need to be adjusted to fit you properly.\n\nOverall:\n  These headphones are a great qualitym and I picked them up for $40, so for that price, 9\/10, would buy again, and recommend."}
{"review":"i thought id take a risk on 40 dollar headset and was very suprised with the product.these headphone sounds great and work with both my galaxy s3 plus on my new ipad. all the sounds from bass to treble sound incredible and they will go very loud i use them everyday and am glad i bought the headset"}
{"review":"I have used these headphones at work at a desk for about a year and a half.  They are easily the best headphones I've ever owned.  I wouldn't call myself an audio expert, but I do own a large variety of audio equipment.  These really reveal every part of an audio file.  They will display things that you won't hear on other headphones in this price range and they'll do it beautifully, especially on the low end.\n\nTo me, these headphones are very comfortable to wear even for 8 hrs straight, something I've done many times.\n\nI have had none of the issues with the connections that others have raised concerns about."}
{"review":"Of all the $40ish headphones I've tried these had very good sound. Two problems though for using these headphones on the go. The cord is very long (8 feet?) and will need to be tied up and put in a pocket. Second, whenever listening outdoors, even a slight wind will create a \"wshhhhhh\" sound in the headphones and the sound will need to be turned up for you to hear the music. Great $40 headphones for indoor use or occasional car\/walking use, but not the choice to make if you plan to be taking them out a lot, especially on a bike or in the wind."}
{"review":"I bought these headphones because I was looking for a pair to plug into my old receiver that has a 1\/4 inch jack. Initially intended to listen to my records, I have actually been using them on my laptop and mp3 player. For $40 this deal was beyond what I thought it would be. Great buy and I would recommend them to everyone."}
{"review":"These had great sound but they hurt my head so much! I could not have them on for longer than 20 min without having to give my cranium a rest. Lots of headaches, so I sent it back. Perhaps its just my low pain tolerance or small head, but thats my personal experience."}
{"review":"Prior to my purchase of these headphones, I used exclusively in-ear headphones ranging from $20-40 with an emphasis on sale items.  This included brands like Sony, Apple, Sennheiser, Ultimate Ears, Skull Candy, Panasonic, and Yurbuds.  Of those in-ear headphones the Sony's were my favorite (but they broke), Yurbuds I use for running (and I like them), and I'm currently using the Sennheiser cx200 (which are alright).  I have a lot of broken headphones though, so I splurged on a pair of these for durability's sake.\n\nSOUND QUALITY\nThese sound better than any of my other in-ear headphones, by a lot.  The concerns about base response must be in relation to other high end headphones, so don't worry about it if you've never experienced higher-end sound quality.  The 65 ohms impedance is a significant difference as compared to the 12 or so from in ear headphones, but using an ipod without an amp is still more than sufficient to use these headphones.  If you never turned your ipod volume to max with in-ears, it's still unlikely you will with these.  Maybe a likely scenario for turning it up to max is if your sitting outside and a leafblower and\/or a lawnmower and\/or a jackhammer is 3 feet away.  But a vacuum cleaner, or average traffic wouldn't force you to the max.  Overall, I'd say it's like a 15% lowering of your ipod volume.  Also of note, there is no worries about sufficient computer or tv or stereo volume when plugged into those.\n\nHEADPHONE BUILD\nAgain, I've never had headphones like these so I'm just going to talk about general changes from in-ear to these.  First off, these probably won't break any time soon.  Very good quality.  The headphone cord is 11 feet, but it's not unmanageable (the wire isn't real heavy).  When wearing these you don't hear any cord noise but when the headphones move, or you touch the ear pieces, they make a plastic squeaky noise much like earphone cord noise.  It's not really plausible to lay in bed with these on.  The headphones are sturdy enough and small enough to be put in a backpack for travel.  The headphone jack is very nice and gold, and the cord has a spring covered end to prevent detachment and stress at the connection point.  It's all black and pretty stylish, with good padding on the ear pieces and the headband.\n\nOverall, these headphones are great.  The sound quality is better than I've ever heard, they are very comfortable to wear, and the price is great.  I haven't had any problems with the impedance.  Base response is great.  Audio-technica put out a really great product.  5 stars, Highly Recommended."}
{"review":"Disappointed in this product.  I listened for about 10 minutes and the sound was cutting out- there may be a short in the cable.  Totally unacceptable and now I have the hassle of having to return them.  Even if the sound didn't cut out I'm not sure about these.  The pads feel cheap and I doubt they would be comfortable or long lasting.  I would steer clear of these headphones."}
{"review":"I purchased these headphones based on the rave reviews--esp comments about sound quality for the price.  After using for a few months, have to say that I am less than impressed with the sound quality. My old Sony headphones provide far richer\/broader sound, but alas they are so old that the cord shorts out.  So these will do for now."}
{"review":"These headphones are amazing. It has HD sound and they are very comfortable. I'm an amateur beat maker and I can tell you that making beats with these headphones is a very fun activity. The samples sound clean, specially the drum kicks. The only drawback is the cord: it is as big as an adult Anaconda. You will have to coil it if you want to go outside with them. That's the only reason I gave it 4\/5.\nStop searching Buy this one!"}
{"review":"These headphones are amazing for studio use. I have not heard clearer sound from a headphone in this price range. I wouldn't recommend these for portable use\/regular listening, as the bass is not powerful whatsoever, they don't fold up, and the cord is 11.5 feet long. You can use them that way if you please. I would recommend highly."}
{"review":"Well, I'm on my second pair of these headphones...I lost the first one. The fact that I chose to buy the same pair again should say something about how I feel about them, though. I'm not a hardcore audiophile, but I think the quality of sound and construction is pretty unbeatable at this price for this form factor. They're a little bulky, but I can't really fault the headphones that much...think it's kind of just the nature of circumaural headphones. My only real complaint is that the cord is sort of ridiculously long...some people seem to think this is a positive attribute, but for the way that I use headphones, it just sort of gets in the way."}
{"review":"I had purchased this because I can't wear earphones comfortably and I wanted something high quality, for once. :) I had initially looked around for something portable but good - something I could travel with. I ended up buying this. These headphones have great sound - amazing, really, to my unprofessional ears - but it's not very portable. It's a little bulky, but as long as you're not planning on carrying it around everywhere, it's perfect. It fits pretty well and is comfortable; it doesn't clamp onto my head or ears uncomfortably so and there's a decent amount of padding. All in all, a good buy and though I do no studio work and I only use it during my leisure time, I say it's great! Now.. if I could find something light and good."}
{"review":"I do recommend this product to others especially at this price. Crisp, clear sound could be a bit louder but I am very happy with it. Comfortable to wear as well."}
{"review":"These are great headphones. They possess absolutely amazing sound quality, which is a must for me being an audiophile on a budget. However, I have noticed that they could be a little louder. My iphone and computer don't have the ability to get these bad boys up to their high volume range. I think this problem lies solely with modern day mp3 equipment and computer monitor outputs. I also hook these up to my many amps, and I get some good volume out of those.\n\nSummary:\n\nGreat quality, a little quiet for everyday use\n\nDesigned more for people who need a budget pair in a studio"}
{"review":"A problem I have with old earphones and headphones I use on my computer or with my electronic keyboard is that the connection point becomes loose so I have to physical hold where my headphones connect to my computer or keyboard to get the full audio without cutout or lapsing into mono, or cutting out altogether.\n\nI knew I would have to get some decent headphones possibly even wireless headphone to get around this issue. And headphones can be pricey. In the local electronics store one could easily spend in the three digits, and one of the buzzwords is noise canceling. This means the headphones cover your ears and cancel out external noise.\n\nThis was not a selling point for me as I listen mostly at home and there is little other noise that I need to cancel.\n\nI bought both this model and the Sennheiser SR120 a wireless headphone that cost over twice as much mostly because I like to be able to list to trance tapes in bed without worrying if the cable is long enough or accidentaqlly damaging the connection if I should fall asleep.\n\nLet me say that I love these headphones. I listen to a movie on computer and it has the perfect stereo sound separation and sound quality with no hiss. The instrumentation was very clear. I listen to classical music and it's a totally new experience. I can locate in my head where different instrument sounds in an orchestra are coming from, or on a pop record where the harmonies sounds are coming from as compared to lead vocals, all the sounds are authentic, crisp and clear.\n\nI like the fact that connecting to the larger connector you would use on a keyboard or hi fi is a screw-in, and that there is a steel wound coiled spring that surrounds the end of the cable and protects the thin wires from wearing out.\n\nSR 120. While I paid much more for the Sennheiser SR120, I don't think the sound quality is significantly better. It does have the convenience of wireless so I was able to hook it up to both my tv and stereo. It is battery operated with rechargeable batteries, and a charging cradle, and the headphone has an on off switch in the left ear, and a volume control knob and separate tuning knob on the right ear. The headphones settle on the ear rather than covering the entire ear, a matter of personal preference.\n\nI love these Audio Technica headphones. I highly recommend them and I would definitely buy them again. In fact I may buy a second set to use exclusively with my electric keyboard. This was the popular reviewed reasonably priced headphone product I found on the Amazon USA site, and clearly the customer feedback is very good. I think you will love it."}
{"review":"Pros:\nHeadphones feel great on your head, very comfortable. Stay on your head very well.\nHeadphones are a quality build for this price, everything holds together well. Metal sliders for sizing are sturdy and work very well.\nMusic sounds clear and good at high and low volume levels.\nHigh quality extra-long cord and metal adapter insures that this won't break or get kinked in a long time.\n\nCons:\nNoise cancellation could be better, but is acceptable.\nBass is clear, but not too powerful.\nSometimes high notes sound a little too high x\/\n\nSummary:Buy if you are looking for something affordable that will sound clear, feel comfortable, and won't have a chance of breaking for many many years. If you are looking for a headset that has excellent sound cancellation with extra powerful bass, then this might not be the headphones for you.\n\nSidenote:I've had this headphones for about two weeks so there may be discrepancies with how I have described the sound quality later on if these need time to be \"burned in\"."}
{"review":"After reading all the reviews I thought that these would be some good headphones for it's price. Except fit really tight on your head. They give me headaches everytime I use them. I ended up just giving them away after a week, and I'm using my iPod headphones now.\nThe sound is good for the price you are paying but there was no comfort when I was wearing them, and that was a huge turn off.\nI would not recommend these if you are very sensitive or particular about comfort."}
{"review":"I bought these with the intention of using them to watch movies on my HDTV.  They don't disappoint.  The sound is crystal clear and you can hear a lot of detail that you can't catch from the TV speakers.  These headphones are also very comfortable with very little leakage.  Good isolation is the main reason I can hear very minute sound details.  Finally, the cord is very thick and it seems very strong.  I highly recommend these to people looking for quality headphones that won't destroy your wallet."}
{"review":"Very comfortable, and excellent sound. I was mowing my lawn last weekend, and tried both this headset and the Creative EP-830 In-Ear Noise Isolating Earphones. This Audio-Technica headset, even though it is not supposed to be \"noise-reducing\", actually outperformed the Creative EP-830 In-Ear Noise Isolating Earphones in blocking out the lawn mower's noise when I listen to exactly the same podcasts and music."}
{"review":"HI, this is a great product, the delivery was on time, the product is great, Great Sound, confort and for the price it is everything that I can ask for and a bit more."}
{"review":"We bought these headphones for the Yamaha keyboard and the grandkids, who both have a a musical ear, are thrilled. We wanted the best sound w could get, allowing for the dangers of childish hands, and I think we chose well. They protect us from the \"practice\" sound. By the way I have good ears too, and when I play with these comfortable headphones, the sound is VERY good. We are happy with the headphones. They arrived well packed and promptly. Thanks for a great transaction."}
{"review":"I love these headphones so much that it's ridiculous.\n\nI've had these headphones for eight years. Now, to people who are careful with their things, this may not sound like a big deal. However, I am one of the clumsiest people I know, if not the clumsiest. Bad Luck Brian? Yeah, I inspired that meme.\n\nThese poor headphones have been slammed in a car door, stepped on, rolled over by my computer chair, dropped down the stairs, tripped over, ripped out of my computer by thieves (who were interrupted, but not soon enough), among many other offenses against these great headphones. Not only are they still alive but THEY LOOK LIKE NEW. How the crap did that happen? Most headphones that I've owned have only lasted one month, maybe six, but never longer than that.\n\nSo they're durable.\n\nAs for the sound, they're better than what you would expect from this price range. I have used these as studio monitors, as has my husband. The bass isn't as rich as I would like it to be, but I compare it to a Bose. The treble sounds fantastic, and I have absolutely no complaints there. It hits the highs and most of the lows. There is absolutely no tinniness, even after all of my horrible mistreatment.\n\nThese are also the most comfortable headphones that I have ever worn. This includes my Turtle Beach gaming headset, which are widely known for their comfort. When I used to play World of Warcraft for many many hours, which required wearing a headset for long periods of time, I actually spurned all of the headsets that were on the market at the time, even the Turtle Beach headset. I would wear a crappy headset around my neck and just use its microphone while I had on my M 30s.\n\nI can not express how wonderful I think these headphones are in every way. They sound great, they take a beating, and they're more comfortable than winter ear muffs. You can't beat em for twice the price, let alone what they're being sold for now."}
{"review":"These things are terrible. They sound terrible, the wire is at least 900 ft long, they're extremely cheap, I won't be buying something from audio-technica again. Don't waste your money, pay 10 extra dollars for some decent Sony Extra Basses."}
{"review":"Purchased these headphones due to pretty good reviews from both Amazon and tech websites.  I am very pleased with the audio quality, especially for the price. I wouldn't recommend the headphones based on noise cancellation, however.  This isn't a huge surprise, since these are a fraction of the price of the high-end noise cancelling headphones so don't let it be a deal-breaker if you are primarily looking for a good-sounding pair of headphones at a manageable price."}
{"review":"I bought these headphones for my wife to use with her Kindle Fire.  She complained that the headphones she was using hurt her ears.  She really likes the sound quality and the fact that they do not press against her ears.  She finds them very comfortable over extended periods on the Kindle."}
{"review":"I used these headphones for about a week and they stopped working.  It may be something wrong with the wires, but it was in perfect condition.  I might have been one of the few that received these defective item, but don't be scared to order these headphones, it can happen to anybody with any item you purchase.\n\nWhen I had the m30s:\n\nPros:  Great deal for under $50.  Sounds great, could've sound better if i broke into them.\n\nCons:  Felt uncomfortable after 30 minutes on my size 7 5\/8 head.  Cord is really long."}
{"review":"Excellent quality headphones. I couldn't be happier. I highly recommend. These replaced a pair of noise cancellation headphones from Sharper Image. These cost about half the price and they are more comfortable and sound much richer. Plus, they don't need batteries! Worth every penny!"}
{"review":"i purchased these headphones, after a move to an apartment, where i could no longer run my stereo system, wanting to show common decency towards my neighbors, i purchased these headphones.  i was pleasantly surprised with the clarity of the sound of both music and my blu rays.  i find they sound good, whether run through my receiver, my mp3 player, or even the cheap soundcard in my computer.  i would purchase again, and recommend them to others searching for an affordable quality set of headphones.  as always amazon was prompt with delivery, item came as advertised, with no shipping damage.  i am very happy with my purchase, and would not hesitate to by audio technica products."}
{"review":"If I had the cash I'd buy a back-up pair of these headphones. I shopped around a lot before buying these despite their relatively low price.\nNice sturdy headphones with the clearest sound separation I've found in the past five pairs of headphones I've bought. I use to work in the radio studios at the\nCanadian Broadcasting Corporation so nice clean sound is very important to me. For $40 these are a STEAL. I promise you won't regret them whether you use them with\nyour iPod or your stereo. I couldn't be happier with the price or quality of these headphones! And they're nice and sturdy yet light, airy and comfortable enough to wear for hours on end too."}
{"review":"I bought these headphones seeking excellent sound and clear bass, and I came across these.  When I saw the price reduction to a little over $40, I thought it was too good to be true, but it was true.  I use these regularly at home (I still prefer earbuds when I'm walking).  The only thing wrong was that I forgot was that the cord is a ridiculous 11 ft., hence why I use them at home.  That is the only problem, but its not that big of a deal to me.  They make up for it with amazing, clear, beautiful sound.  Audio-Technica has impressed me ten times over with these and I will continue to buy products from them that interest me because of these.  I highly recommend them."}
{"review":"Much better headphones for the money than I expected. Fit well, very light. Sound is very good for music, games, anything. I use them without an amp on a macbook pro retina, bet they would be even better with an amp. No complaints, well worth the money."}
{"review":"I've heard these and the M50s, and these are good for the price. The M50s are over $100 and these cost about $40 here. They are not as good as the M50s, but I decided to not spend as much."}
{"review":"I wanted some nice headphones since I wear them 8 hours a day and didn't want to drop %150 on Bose. These are a great substitute. They sound great and look professional. The reason for 4 stars is they are slightly uncomfortable when wore around the neck and they fit my (rather large) head tightly and it causes pressure on my eye glasses.\n\nGood product, especially considering the price."}
{"review":"I purchased these headphones after the ear pads for my HD490s worn out. While the ATH-M30s are very neutral, after the burn-in, the Sennheiser's are very bass heavy in comparison. Excellent headphones for the price. I was really surprised by how neutral\/flat they are, very detailed. Like my Avid 101 loudspeakers. I'd recommend these to anyone."}
{"review":"The headphone were bought after hearing its 150.00 brother, for the price they are ok, nothing like the 150.00 ones though, lack bass but are very clear headphones. You get what you pay for."}
{"review":"These headphones produce very clear sounds. The bass\/lows are excellent at low volume. The sound insulation is very good. Even though they are an over the ear set, they are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I often fall asleep with them on."}
{"review":"I like the way they sound. I'm sure they aren't in the same league as much more expensive headphones but for the price they are really nice. I can hear details in the music that I didn't notice even with my very good earbuds. The frequency response seems nice and flat and lets the music come through just the way it was recorded."}
{"review":"These are very comfortable.  It is hard for me to find headphones that don't hurt my ears but these are so comfortable that they don't bother me at all - even for extended periods.  The sound quality is fantastic as well.  I'm very pleased!"}
{"review":"Besides the fact I was able to purchase these headphones for about $150 dollars off they work great and the quarter inch adapter screws onto the 8mm headphone jack so that they don't separate if you pull it out of the audio console. Great quality product. Audio Technica delivers once again with these head phones. Great purchase."}
{"review":"ok so i was looking for some good headphones under 50 bucks and i found these and with all the five star reviews it seemed to be a no brainer.  ok so lets start of with the UNBELIEVABLY LONG CORD, i mean seriously i am never going to be 20 feet away from my ipod or computer, it makes it heavier and i just zip-tied the excess to make it shorter.  you don't think about it but the cord is 11 feet long omg.  ok enough about that lets move on to comfort, they are ok buy they hurt my ears after a while and i don't have ears that stick out like an elephant.  i mean everybody boasts about the comfort but i don't get it they are uncomfortable and i cant wear them for a while.  ok and finnally sound quality, it is mid-range at best, not great but not bad just ok.  the people that wrote all the five star reviews don't know what their talking about.  overall i would not recommend.  i got these big headphones because i thought they would give me better sound quality and comfort than my previous koss (which broke).  i might return these and go with my koss again man those were some GOOD headphones for 30 bucks, and i could fit them in my backpack.  save your money and buy the koss headphones."}
{"review":"Best headphones in the price range. I have had this for a couple of months now and listen to music for over 6 hours on this. The music quality is excellent and they are comfortable too. Would highly recommend this if your looking for something in this price range. I looked at Sennheiser HD 202 and Sennheiser HD201 and found them to be uncomfortable. Finally settled for this one and have never been happier.\n\nPros :\nVery good sound quality.\nComfortable.\nVery long cable length.\nThe connector to the audio port is very sturdy.\n\nCons :\nVolume is lower than other headphones."}
{"review":"This headphones really sounds great, have great bass and are really comfortable. The only bad thing is that it does not have it's own volume so you can control it from the headphones, but besides that they are great.\nSometimes the sound is not as high as I would like to, but that is because I like music so high.\nAnyway awesome product, maybe one of the best products I have bought in many years."}
{"review":"I was looking for over the ear headphones and I didn't want to have to pay too much.  These are perfect and the sound quality is wonderful. Great for the price."}
{"review":"I would give these 5 stars but for the discomfort I experience while wearing them.  They feel fine initially, but after a few minutes the pressure applied by the pads becomes irritating.  I take them off when the great music no longer compensates for the intensifying headache."}
{"review":"I had a pair of Sony pro headphones, but they kept collapsing on me and the ear padding kept coming off and it was a pain to get back on.  These AT ones don't collapse but alas it looks like the headphone pad is the same.  Sound is good.  I know some people need collapsing to save space, but I don't and it's a hassle when it keeps happening.  So yay for AT."}
{"review":"I have an AKG K450 and I am very satisfied with its sound quality. I was skeptical about buying an Audio-Technica product because I used to have a ~$150 headphone of that make and it was completely crap. But M30 is different - even now I have only been listening it for a hour, I can say it has great sound quality, great appearance and most importantly, unbeatable price :-) The only downside is the cord - it's too long so it's impossible for me to wear it out for a walk - and it's not replaceable too. What a bummer! Still, I highly recommend it for home use."}
{"review":"I have not had a nice set of headphones since my first stereo (that came with an 8-track!) back in the '70s.  Every set I've had since then has been the ear pieces that came stock with my iPod (or whatever) or a cheap lightweight set.  So, I really don't have much to compare these too, but I knew they would have to be better than those awful ones that fit inside or wrap around my ear. My non-expert opinion is that these headphones are excellent for the price.  I am hearing background instruments and voices in songs that I've listened to for years and never heard before.  The sound balance is good, not too much bass which I don't want in headphones.  I haven't used them yet in a noisy place, but took them to the beach last weekend and it was like I had the place to myself because I heard nothing but the music.  They come with a very long cord which I think will be useful in an office or home setting, but I don't like having that much cord when walking.  They fit snug, but not tight and are comfortable.  I'm not sure about how they contain the sound.  Those other folks on the beach may have heard my music, too, because I had it cranked up, but if they did, they didn't seem to care.  These are great and I'd buy them again."}
{"review":"Got the headphones, plugged them into my phone and they didn't work unless i pushed down on the jack. Not worried about not working on my phone as im only using them for messing around on sound board. Once I was home I put the adapter on and used them on the sound board. Here's my pro and cons\n\nPROS-\n  Awesome fit. Very comfortable\n\nCONS-\n  SOUND LIKE CRAP! unless you have a headphone amp they will most likely be useless to you if you like loud music..\n  No bass response what so ever..my headphones i got with my phone are better"}
{"review":"The glowing reviews for these headphones are well deserved. I received these headphones about a week ago and so far I am very impressed indeed. The sound is crisp and full right out of the box. I have a large head and they fit comfortably - no issues. I bought these with the main intent of playing music through my iphone (I stream a lot of music through Spotify and Pandora). The volume is close, but not quite perfect, to being where I want it to be. I will be picking up a headphone amp (Fiio E3 or E5)to boost the volume by several more ticks - which will make the sound level optimal, as well as to strengthen the base whenever needed (depends on the song or genre). I listen predominantly to electronica, new age, ambient, hip hop, and some rock. I put these cans through their paces through my stereo receiver and the sound is fantastic! I am able to pick out sounds I normally wouldn't listening through my speakers. I am VERY delighted with this purchase and have absolutely ZERO buyer's remorse. In fact, I am so impressed I will be ordering a pair of the Audio Technica M50's to use exclusively at home and my M30's will be my travel cans. I used to own a pair of Skull Candy Hesh's and these simply sound crisper. The highs and mids are superior and the bass is less pronounced, yet remains incredibly rich and full.\n\nThese are absolutely the best headphones in this price range bar none. I am sure there are better headphones at a higher price but I would recommend these for anyone who is either on a budget, as an excellent starter pair of headphones for the budding audiophile, or someone who wants a high quality and durable (yet cheap) pair of cans to travel with and cram into a backpack or briefcase without fear of damaging them.\n\nPros:\n\n* Well crafted and durable. The plug\/cord is reinforced and thick. The frame is a sturdy metal\n* Absolutely immaculate sound quality. Precise and pristine sound all across the spectrum.\n* Comfortable - I am a big guy and these fit my head like a pair of isotoners.\n* Deceptively inexpensive - these sound like $100.00+ headphones\n\nCons:\n* very bland design. No bright colors or frills. (To me this is actually a plus as I prefer the deconstructed and simple industrial design)\n* I wish it would have included a carry bag"}
{"review":"For the price, I dare say it's unbeatable. I heard people having issues regarding comfortability, but unless I keep the headphones on for a few hours, I have no issues. If it helps, I wear glasses and have a 7 and 5\/8 size head. All in all, The headphones have a very solid range and a solid buy for its price."}
{"review":"Sound cutting action was not actually advertised but I find these to reduce ambient noise almost to nil. Not able to hear people calling me, etc. Very comfortable set, hi-fidelity (does anyone use that term any more?) sound with good bass but not too much. I hate a pair of earphones pre-set to knock your fillings loose with bumping bass. These are great all around, without distortion or distraction of equalization set for a particular listener (like the \"jazz\" or \"classical\" setting on my car stereo. Right-left panning is centered, but there is some, and it's enough for me for the way I use them, basically background tunes from Windows Media Player while I work on my computer. I didn't want to spend much, but was willing to drop $40 on these and I'm happy I did. HIGHLY satisfying sound for the money."}
{"review":"Outstanding value: these headphones easily match or better headphones costinng three or four times as much (as, for example, from a certain German company which shall be nameless). Don't pass these up; you won't be sorry!"}
{"review":"I use this headphone on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Cord is a bit long... but minor issue. It probably wasn't designed for portable devices like phones but damn. This together with Power Amp Player :D. Running ICS and Google Play player isn't the best player, so I been through many headphones trying to find that good sound. These headphone got it. Go get it."}
{"review":"For the price, the sound quality is amazing. Perfect mix of trebles and bass, your lows, his and mids. Ive had beats and these are so much better sound quality, beats have so much bass it drowns out the rest of the music and makes the sound very muggy and hard to hear, with these there is a perfect balance so you get a crisp clear but also bassy sound at neccesary points. Only critique where the beats would win is the volume. Beats are very loud whereas if your on an airoplane youll need to turn your device up full but this isn't a big problem, im probably deaf from too many gigs."}
{"review":"Packaging intact, the quality is good, the line is long enough, listening comfort\nPackaging intact, the quality is good, the line is long enough, listen to comfortable, sound quality good, moderate weight, deserve to be big brand, worth buying"}
{"review":"I have had a pair of these for my home project studio now for over a year.  And without a doubt, these are wonderful for mixing\/mastering in my home setup.  The audio quality is ridiculously good and they are very comfortable.  I have worn these through multiple 12-16 hour sessions with little to no pain or discomfort at all.  If you are looking for a sturdy made headphone with sound quality that is pretty much spot on across the board, then pick these up.  I just added two more pairs to my set up along with the&nbsp;."}
{"review":"Pros:\n-Everything sounds amazing\n-Blocks out most outside noise\n-Fantastic bass response\n-Long, durable cord\n-Comes with larger phono plug\n-Adjustable\n-Can be amplified quite a bit without adding distortion\n-Not $150+\n\nCons:\n-After prolonged periods of listening, they really start to hurt the ears. It's like someone is tightening a clamp around my head.\n-Any music under the quality of a 256kbps 44.1kHz MP3 sounds degraded (but that's because it is). Time to upgrade your library to some higher quality MP3s, or better yet FLAC.\n\nOther Notes:\n-Despite the pain endured by listening to music with these, I still keep these on for much of the day. ERMERGERRRD, such sound quality."}
{"review":"If your looking for a good sounding headphone that won't break the bank, then these are the headphones for you. I purchased these because I got tired of the \"in your ear\" type that would never stay in my ear. Comes with a adapter for stereo equipment. I use mine with my ipod and they sound fantastic. I also plug them into my computer when wanting to listen to music without disturbing anyone. This is a excellent buy from Amazon....you can't go wrong."}
{"review":"For the price I paid for these, they are amazing. The wire is a bit too long, but thats fixable. Sound quality is great, and they block out the sound of the outside quite well. Really happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend this product."}
{"review":"Just as a little warning, these are not consumer headphones!  I was looking for some ear-covering headphones, and I liked the price point on these, but while I really liked the sound quality, the cable is way too long!  Probably fine for sitting at a desk or sound monitor, but you can't walk around with these listening to your iPod, since the cord would reach all the way to the ground.\n\nSo, good sound quality, but not for use with mobile devices."}
{"review":"Fantastic Value. That is big selling point on the ATH-M30s. For $40, I doubt you could find anything with comparable quality. I use these when I play my electric guitar and occasionally when listening to music(although I have dedicated, more expensive headphones for that purpose). They are somewhat bare-bones. But Like I said, for $40, I have no serious complaints.\n\nPROS:\n- Great sound quality for the price. Not too much bass, only a little muddy (These are huge pluses for such inexpensive cans).\n- Incredible durability. I have stepped on these a couple times and my foot is always in worse shape than the ATH-M30s.\n- Comparatively light\n- 1\/4 in. to 3.5mm adapter\n- Long cord\n- Still working great after 1 year\n\nCONS:\n- They Squeeze my head! This is a common problem I have with on-ear headphones. They push my ears flat up against the side of my noggin and it can become very uncomfortable. After 45 minutes on my head, I'm ready to take them off.\n- Aesthetically bland. These are more focused on utility rather than style. This really doesn't bother me, but it is still worth noting.\n\n4\/5 for being less than comfortable, but still a fantastic deal for anyone on a budget."}
{"review":"it has been the best purchase in audio that I've done. Great bass, excellent quality and price, you are completelly isolated when you wear it."}
{"review":"I've had the ATH-M30 headphones for 13 weeks now, a bit more than 3 months. And they're absolutely wonderful!\n\nPros: -Sound Quality: I literally heard things in my songs I never knew existed. Exquisite sound quality for the price, take my word if you want.\n-Comfortability: Extremely comfortable design. Soft artificial leather headband and ear cups.\n-Size: I thought they'd be a little bigger from the product picture but they're actually pretty small. I can hold em' with one hand folded. They have a good collapsible design which is good so you could put them in the carry pouch they include.\n-Build: Built surprisingly well for $40 headphones. The ear pads are built out of a good, hard, sturdy, plastic.\nO.K now true story:\nI toss and turn when I sleep a lot and I did that with these on plenty of times. I wake up to find these headphones looking so DEFORMED, I started thinking about buying new headphones.\nBut to my surprise, after unfolding them, they still work great with no problems at all! I would be more careful but I'm not conscious when I sleep.\n\nOnly Con: (Any it's my fault.)\nThe cord, is well built and never tangled on me yet, it's long. And when I say long, I MEAN LONG. I shouldn't include this as a con cause they clearly state how long the cord it is in the description and these are professional headphones, like in the studio. So yes, it's not their fault, it's mines.\n\nOverall: Extremely well built and if you don't mind the really, really, long cord. You'll really be getting the bang for your buck. I bought other Audio Technica products after receiving these and I am not disappointed. Made extremely well and seem to have a good longevity. These ATH-M30's have a 3.5mm plug which is gold plated and used for things such as MP3 players.\nThe 1\/4\" adapter, also included, is also gold plated and can easily be screwed on to use on amps, stereos, or in the studio. 5\/5 and highly recommended to anyone looking for preeminent sound quality in their music."}
{"review":"This took less courage than I thought, and the results are(so far) better than I expected. A few reasons might be:\n1. Product Recognition. Audio Technica headphones have been around long enough to establish themselves, even to longtime audio hounds like myself. Audio Technica started in an era where (especially) headphone companies \"branded\" their approach to sound reproduction, so after initially finding the right basic sound, the puzzle was finding the right price point.\n2. Sheer number of reviews. For this particular model, most reviews mentioned price as being a prime motivator. Also useful were comparisons with other models by the same company. The number of opinions almost guarantee some variance between the experienced audio hands and the \"these were loud and comfortable\" people.\n3. Luck. The steadily rising price of most of the Audio Technica models means I was lucky enough to run into the right model at the right time at a terrific price.\n\nWithout echoing TOO many other reviewers, I can offer, that the more different types of music you enjoy, the more dazzling these phones are. \"Balanced\" is the most accurate assessment, but that word can imply that something may be missing at the bass end, or the highs may not be there, or vocals might be slightly buried. So far, in the first four weeks, None of these shortcomings are emerging. Years of checking out different phones, back when 'serious' audio stores had walls of choices, I learned that the first place even high-end phones can slip up is with simple piano music, classical, or jazz. In runs of piano notes, sometimes individual notes \"pop out\" , or sound louder, or just ring in your head more. This usually indicates that some resonances were overlooked by the engineers, and less expensive phones, or phones designed more for a rock audience, can have a bunch of these problems. Needless to say, the ATH-M30s delivered clean, accent free piano runs and chords.\nThe best news for me was, I am suddenly listening to ALL my favorite music for hours at a stretch. The tight seal can make the earpads warm, but the seal is accomplished with a minimum of pressure on the ears and head, so head fatigue and headaches shouldn't accompany even the lengthiest sessions.\nSo far, this purchase has produced the best possible result: I don't need another set of phones!"}
{"review":"After a friend told me earphones are bad for your ears because of the extra vibrations. I decided to look into these headphones. The first thing i noticed was the sound. Good moderate improvement over my 30 dollar earphones. Comfort wise, there can be some improvement. These are fine for like 30 minutes. But after that, they start to get uncomfortable and have to move them around til you find another good position. One thing that i don't like is how long the earphone cord is. Seriously, it's very long. I'm 6 3' and i can use it to jump rope! It also comes with an headphone jack adapter and a one year warranty, which i will definitely use. Tired of paying over 100 bucks a year on soundgear."}
{"review":"I use these headphones when I play my Clavinova digital piano.  Even when I am home alone, I use these headphones because the sound is much better with these headphones than with the speakers built into the Clavinova -- and the Yamaha Clavinova is a very high quality digital piano.  I find these headphones to be quite comfortable as well; I can wear them as long as I want and my ears do not start to hurt.  During a recent move I lost these headphones.  I quickly replaced them with exactly the same model."}
{"review":"This junk was awful! The sound was amazing and it isolated sound, but after 1 week, the cord got loose and stopped working. Do not waste your money on this junk!"}
{"review":"I was looking for replacement earphones when my skull candy earphones started to fall apart. These are good, good sound quality, I don't get headaches when I have them on for long periods of time. They are comfortable"}
{"review":"Note that these are not noise canceling headphones. I thought they were and bought them, but will likely keep them since they are okay and good for the price. Comfortable on the head, generous cable length (a little too long), good build quality, sound quality is good but bass could have been richer."}
{"review":"I'm picking up sounds with these that I never knew existed with other headphones. I was blaming it on the digital medium, but it turns out my speakers and headphones were the culprit. In addition to great sound, they are extremely comfortable. I think these are an amazing value for the price."}
{"review":"These are surprisingly good sounding headphones. Pretty decent low end, and clean mids and highs. I'd say they definitely hold their own with more expensive sets. For casual listening I don't see why the average person would feel the need to spend much more when you can get a set of this quality for this roughly 40 bucks. Although I don't wear them for long periods of time I could see how they might be uncomfortable after a while.\n\nI'm a live sound engineer and while a lot of guys carry around real high end headphones from gig to gig, I'm content with these because they still sound good and if they get thrashed or lost its not a huge deal. And I don't make real critical mix decisions based on headphones for live mixing, so yet another reason I don't feel the need to use a real pricey set of cans. If I was mixing in the studio and had to rely on headphones then I would probably consider a higher end set of cans.\n\nAlso a bonus is having the straight cord, curly cords are a pain in the a**."}
{"review":"After being disappointed by a $50 pair of Sony headphones, I snagged these Audio-Technica's based on the reviews here on Amazon. I'm very impressed with the quality of these headphones. The cord is very long and durable, the jack is strong and well constructed. The headphones themselves are very comfortable, block out a ton of background noise, and aren't too bulky or heavy. They're very durable and can take a beating.\nThe sound quality for a non-amplified pair of headphones is nothing short of amazing. The majority of headphones in this price range are boomy, obnoxious headphones with poor midrange and high end performance. The ATH-M30 is incredibly well balanced with heavy lows, comfortable mids, and stunningly clear highs. I can't recommend a better pair of headphones in this price range."}
{"review":"I purchased mine with a 63% (!) discount on this site. All I can say it is an amazing piece of equipment for the price. Please note: it does not isolate very well - so it's probably not well suited for places with a lot of environment noise. Maybe I have a shrunken head, but the fit is snug while still comfortable. Also note, they do cover your ears completely. In other words, when it is very warm you will probably start hatching new lifeforms in the cans. (This was a joke) - but there is little air circulating."}
{"review":"When I opened the package for my new Audio-Technica ATH-M30 Professional Headphones I was excited. I love listening to high quality music. These headphones are amazing. I have spent $250+ on headphones and was unable to reach the performance level that the Audio-Technica ATH-M30 Professional Headphones have given me. I recommend these headphones to all music lovers that do not want to spend a lot of money on headphones. I find nothing wrong with these headphones."}
{"review":"Pros:  Excellent sound for this price!  I can hear fine details in highs, mids and low ranges.  Voice-overs sound very resonant.  Super long cord, let's you move around as you listen.  Light-weight headset, creates suction over ear and muffles outside noises (slightly).\n\nCons: A tiny bit tight on the head, and a bit heavy, compared to the mid-sized super-light over-ear pads I prefer (eg, Maxell NC-III)."}
{"review":"This headphone was featured in San Francisco Chronicle this week.  I was shopping for a replacement for my 6 year-old Sony MDR which was pretty good but was falling apart.\n\nI came here to amazon.com and read many of the reviews.  My take is this is an average headphone, appropriately priced though.  I'll be keeping it because the price was reasonable and I use it during work maybe a couple of hours a day, so my needs are simple.  My $60 6 year-old Sony was better IMO."}
{"review":"Love these headphones but there is a huge problem with mine, they're gone!  I set them down for one second and my wife snatched them.  Now I have to sneak them out of her desk to use them.  I guess now I will need to buy another.  All kidding aside these really do have great sound.  When price is added to the equation these headphones are mind blowing!  Although not active noise cancelling they really insulate you from ambient noise (i.e. conversations in the same room... no wait I just realized why my wife uses these all the time, doh!).  Clarity is excellent for the price and over the ear comfort is exceptional."}
{"review":"Great for use with computer games and listening to music.  Cancels out a lot of background noise while I enjoy listening to what I want to."}
{"review":"These head phones are really amazing. I highly recommend these head phones if you plan to travel. The only thing it has a very long cord, which can be a negative when traveling. It's descent at blocking noise when traveling on planes, but it doesn't completely cancel the noise. I would say that it's pretty descent at listening flac lossless files. Like I said earlier, the only thing is long cord, which can be a positive or a negative."}
{"review":"These headphones are not worth the price it was sold for. They sound good but professional? That's a real reach. A price like $25.00 would be fair and honest. I kept them but sorry I didn't return them now after seeing what other headphones that are better go for..I got ripped off."}
{"review":"These audio-technica headphones are sooo good!  The sound is pretty clean and sharp, there's low background noise, and very comfy.  Not to mention that they actually look like professional headphones! I use them to record music (although I'm an amateur), but I'm pretty sure that I got more than I paid for them. Im pretty happy."}
{"review":"The clarity was great! Sound wise it isn't the best compared to other ones, but for the price definitely was worth it. I mainly use it for my laptop for movies and music. They are very comfortable and stay in place that is very nice."}
{"review":"5:09 PM, Thursday 8\/16\/2012...\n\nThe ATH-M30 headphones were waiting for me when I arrived home from work yesterday evening. Package presentation is pretty good--at first it looks like a dreaded blister pack, but thanks to folding plastic tabs and clever assembly the headphones were easy to get at. Points off for the means A-T uses to secure the plug inside the case: It's squeezed into a plastic recess, and this caused pressure to be applied to the cord by the metal spring meant to protect it. The result is what appears to be a permanent indentation in the cord material. It doesn't look too deep, so I'm hopeful future durability has not been compromised.\n\nBuild quality is excellent, fit is comfortable even for my larger-than-average ears, and isolation is excellent given the materials used (plastic, plastic and more plastic...but good quality plastic all the same). Once I adjusted the sizing, I did not have to do it again for the remainder of the evening. The sizing mechanism is metal and the friction is just right to hold sizing while not being too terribly difficult to readjust.\n\nI listened to music for approximately three hours alternating between my late-2009 white MacBook and Verizon iPhone 4. Neither had any trouble whatsoever driving the 65-ohm ATH-M30's. This was my chief worry prior to receiving them, and I'm happy to report I will not have to pop for a headphone amp right off the bat. Later, perhaps...\n\nSound quality is excellent to these non-audiophile ears. My selection of albums included Bruce Springsteen's \"Born in the U.S.A.\", Tina Turner's \"Private Dancer\" and Roger Waters' \"The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking\"--all released in 1984, in an odd coincidence. \"Pros and Cons\" was especially enjoyable thanks to the headphones' good isolation qualities and clear sound reproduction...I heard many things I'd not previously detected listening to this album through loudspeakers or through other headphones. I'm looking forward to listening to other albums in my collection and hearing the additional details these headphones are capable of revealing.\n\nSo far, for what I paid, these are an absolute bargain. Rating four stars for now, and will add a fifth once I've had some time to burn them in and see how they hold up build-wise.\n\nUPDATE: January 6, 2013...fifth star added for ongoing listening enjoyment and durability. The value on these 'phones is hard to beat."}
{"review":"I  received these headphones a few days ago and they\n really pack a sound punch. Excellent clarity,volume,bass, high and mid-range\n sound. Studio quality phones .They are also very comfortable and  easily adjusted.\n  The included adapter is also a plus.\nI would recommend them for any use ,studio or otherwise.\n  Very nice product."}
{"review":"These are a great pair of headphones. The cord is long enough(maybe a little too long). The jack was well sized for plugging into my Nook. And the shipping was excellent."}
{"review":"I've had them for a month.  I'm not a pro, but they sound and feel great to me.  No problems so far.  Would recommend them."}
{"review":"I've been using these headphones about a week now and I like them a lot.  I'm not an audiophile or a music producer; I simply want some good-quality headphones to listen to my iPod without feeling like my head's being squeezed in a vice.  These headphones do the job nicely.  They're snug but have a lot of give.  They do tend to make my right ear sore after a while but that's more because of my glasses.  The headphones do exert pressure on the glasses, but much less than I thought they would.  The earpieces do get warm (and I wish they were more cushion-y), but not unusually so; and since I'm simply sitting at a desk (vs. jogging or being outside) it doesn't bother me.  I like the long, thick, heavy-duty cord; and the fact that it's only connected to one side of the headphones is fabulous.  Sound isolation is okay--not as good as some other earphones, but decent.  Once the music cranks up it blocks out a lot of outside noise.  So overall, nothing negative to say about these guys!"}
{"review":"This product arrived on time and works well for my application.  These are not Dr. Dre quality, but are well worth the price.  Excellent budget headphones."}
{"review":"Long time heavy Amazon user, never been inspired to write a review, but these headphones are just amazing.  Arguably the lightest, most comfortable headphones I've ever worn, and the sound quality is just through the roof.  I'm hearing details in my music I never noticed before, and for this price its just an insanely good deal.  I just bought another pair for the office!"}
{"review":"I have to say I am completely impressed by these headphones. I cannot say how comfortable these are, and the sound quality is better than I imagined. I read a lot of people complain about being tight on the head. I don't have that problem. They are extremely comfortable on the ears. The cord is much better quality than previous headphones I have had. I immediately listened to music and was impressed by the sound quality. I would definitely recommend these to anyone, and for the price you definitely cannot go wrong."}
{"review":"I was a little hesitant to buy A-T as I have been a big name guy most of my life.  I'm not really an audiophile, but I do know what good sound quality and poor sound quality is.  I have to say, I'm thoroughly impressed with these headphones.  As far as fit is concerned, they fit beautifully on my head.  I bought them for work, so I was a little worried about sound bleeding out, but I've been jamming out with no complaints from coworkers.\n\nThe sound quality is great.  Great low end sound and decent highs.  I can have them on for hours with no issues.  I would definitely recommend these to friends.  I will say that because of these, I have been awakened to just how bad the quality of music coming from Pandora really is.  I can barely listen to it anymore.  These almost require you have a good quality music format to really get a sense for how good these headphones really are.\n\nAll in all, A+.  Very happy with my purchase.\n\nOn a construction note, these seem very sturdy as well.  Granted, I'm pretty easy on them as I'm sitting at a desk when I wear them, and I've only had them for a few days, but they are fantastic nonetheless."}
{"review":"I removed the headphones from the package and decided to test them on some of my favorite albums: Moving Pictures, Fragile, Aenima, Disraeli Gears, Live at Filmore East, Best of Both Worlds, etc\n\nIt most certainly passed the test.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of overpowering bass, so the equal balance of treble\/bass is one of the first qualities I noticed in these, but it was still strong and pronounced throughout. Perhaps even more impressive was the clarity of the treble and the surround sound qualities that are both maintained very well even at high volume. These are better sounding than many of my older headsets that I purchased years ago for hundreds of dollars.\n\nThe one downfall I discovered is that these are not intended to be noise-cancelling. When I turned up the volume I was entirely enveloped by the sound but it was not very well isolated at lower volumes and I often found myself pressing the phones against my ears to achieve a more contained sound.\n\nOverall, these are the best headphones I have ever used for such a reasonable price and the quality has left me quite impressed. I will recommend these to my friends and family or even as a gift for the holidays."}
{"review":"i needed a new set of headphones and i looked everywhere to find something that was just what i wanted. i found them on amazon.com. they are very comfortable and the sound is so crisp and clear. the line from the left side is long enough to sit and move around. if i ever need another pair, i would choose to buy these. awesome! These headphones are so great i have ordered another for my tv. great product. i enjoy theses headphone so much. worth the price."}
{"review":"First I would like to add this is the first Audio Technica product I have owned. Never really considered them for headphones until really doing some research. Cnet was recommending these to people who don't want to spend more than $50 for headphones and these are spot on. I bought the Koss Portapros based on their recommendation and like them but wanted a descent set of circumaural closed back headphones. Plug is heavy grade metal, twist on adapter; feels really high quality and uniform when screwed together. Excellent balanced sound is what these excel in compared to others I've owned or tried out. Even from my ipod classic's little headphone amp these can crank out some good volume. Audio Technica is not some hipster brand like the Beats, Skullcandy etc. but they do have a reputation for high-quality audio gear. I really think these are underrated for how they perform but I guess some prefer looks over sound. These will definitely do until I can afford some $100+ Audio Technicas."}
{"review":"I got a pair to wear at work--our open floor plan office can get kind of noisy. They're all-day comfortable and block out enough of the noise around me that I can concentrate on my work. I've let two of my co-workers borrow them for an hour or so and both bought pairs. One bought two pair: one for the office and another for home.\n\nMy iPhone drives them just fine, but I'll stick with buds for exercise and commuting. Shame, really--the sound quality on these is far superior to what I get out of any buds I've owned. It's probably a bit much to call these \"professional\" grade, but listening to music I've owned for years I'm hearing stuff in the mids I never knew was there. Definitely recommended and for the price, I'm getting another pair for home myself."}
{"review":"I was optimistic about purchasing these headphones because of the price, but they are great.  The sound quality and comfort was beyond my expectation.  A must have if you don't want to spend a ton of money on \"Beats\" headphones."}
{"review":"Given the price I was very close to giving this 5 stars.  I would have done 4.5 if I could.  I am very happy with the sound quality.  The only issue I have is after a while they feel somewhat uncomfortable to me.  It's been years since I have used full sized headphones like these but I don't recall much of a comfort issue with my old pair.  Out of fairness it could just be me.  I have not compared the comfort of these with other full sized headphones, and even if I did, it takes about an hour before I start feeling any irritation so comparison shopping on comfort probably would not have done much good.  Like most people, overall I find these to be a great value."}
{"review":"I'm a drummer an aspiring musician an will be doing a lot of home recording soon. I bought these headphones so I could better listen to beats an drum fill's to break down a song an teach myself. Now I'm use to just standard ear buds that came with my Sony MP3. I have been using for quite some time now which wasn't letting me pick apart the songs like I needed (let alone the bass guitar). I got these in today and I absolutely love them! everything is so clear, its amazing for what the price was.\n\nI've never used high quality, expensive brands before so I cant say there better or compare them to any other but there definitely worth it for someone on a budget like myself."}
{"review":"The sound is good, specially in the bass part of the audio band. I'd recommend this product to anyone looking for a pair of headphones for a daily ordinary use."}
{"review":"Just bought the ATH-30's as a replacement for the iPod ear buds.  Impressive sound! Exceptional highs and bass.  I'm hearing sounds I've never heard on music that I've been listening to for 20 years.\n\nThe only downside to these headphones (other than the loooooong cable which is easy to deal with) is that the cups are VERY tight on the head.  I'm not sure if this passes with time, but seems to me there should be a way to adjust the pressure on the ears.\n\nOverall, very impressed with the sound of the ATH-30's."}
{"review":"I was so impressed when I opened this product. It was obvious that high quality products were used all over these headphones, the best and longest plug- in cord ever and then I plugged them in and hit play...OY!These speakers are low rent big time. The sound quality is so bad and the range so restricted I thought my stereo had malfunctioned! I hooked up my Farm & Fleet clearance $19.95 specials and found the maifunction is in these poor quality speakers. BAD.If they replace the speakers these are first class."}
{"review":"I got these for my daughter, who is particular about her headphones and sound quality.  As she is Autistic, she needed something that would block out noise in the room so she can use her music to calm her and help her focus.  She said they have very clear sound and work very well to block out ambient noise - she can not hear people talking but can hear our dogs barking if they are in the same room.  Her only complaints are they squeeze her ears and the cord is too long.\n\nPros:  Great price, great sound, blocks noise\nCons:  well - according to my daughter - they squeeze her ears and the cord is too long"}
{"review":"Decent for the price! Very comfortable on the ears and head. Mainly good for studio and mixing\/mastering, precise panning, depth and long listening. Some what cheap studio monitors, what more can I say.."}
{"review":"I cannot believe how great the sound quality is on these Audio-Technica!  After I first purchased them, I went everywhere with them.  It made listening to music so much better, as you got the whole dynamics of the recording as it as meant to be heard.  They transport easily, they are made very well and you don't have to worry about breaking them, and I would recommend these headphones to anyone who wants to hear great music without having to pay a couple of hundred bucks for a good set of headphones."}
{"review":"just got these today. the sound is good enough. bass is certainly reserved in these headphones but i guess it's meant to be that way. i have been listening to mostly songs from youtube and i guess the poor audio quality in youtube is making these headphones to not perform the way they should. these are certainly not noise cancelling headphones as i can hear everything with the music off .\n\nbottom line. if you want to listen to classical music and stuff like orchestra or yanni then this could be the perfect fit. not for listening to heavy metal or bassy music. anyways a good buy . i will see how this headphone performs in the days to come once the drivers get burned out."}
{"review":"Everything written and said about the headphone is true. Absolutely delightful sound. Very balanced and rich sound. They make most of your music collection new by bringing out hidden instruments and lesser notes. All frequencies well balanced and not too much emphasis on Bass. This makes them very nice for Indian music especially. Although bulky, but at this price, there are few things better than these."}
{"review":"Bought these head-phones for my boyfriend, he absolutely loves them! He raves about the sound quality of his metal music and I do not have to hear a single tune. Highly recommend this product!"}
{"review":"I've been using these headphones for about 3 months now and overall I'm not satisfied with their performance.  I had read through many reviews before purchasing these headphones as there are many varying options in this price range.  These seemed to be the best fit for overall value\/quality.  I'm unhappy with the overall sound quality as sometimes they make files sound grainy as if the file is of low fidelity.  I've tried them with different devices and they have this issue across all of them.  I also thought possibly that it was the quality of the files that were causing the issues,  so I then cross referenced the files by listening in different bit\/rates and different file types.  It was not the file type that mattered.  They are ill equipped at handling very deep bass that I had previously come to know with a competitors headphones. This problem wasn't limited to music files either.  For movies, it seems the same issues occur.  The deeper notes lose their crispness and it's distracting.  The build quality seems good, I've had no problems in this area.  The fit and function work well also.  Perhaps I just got a bad example of this product,  but overall,  I would recommend buyers look elsewhere in this price range.\n\nI would not recommend this product to others."}
{"review":"I've been looking to get myself a new set of headphones for quite some time. I went over numerous sites and recommendations before I landed on these. I was a bit apprehensive if something under $50 could live up to the superlatives every other person seem to use to describe these headphones so I held on to my decision on buying it and decided to sleep over the thought...\n\nA few days later, I felt comfortable enough and went forward with the purchase. It arrived within 8 days and it came well packaged. The Audio Technica box itself is very compact and extremely easy to open. The headphones itself are quite light and sturdily built. The ear padding is soft and rests comfortably on the ears, although initially I did develop some ear pain but I've found a better way to wear them so no issues now.\n\nComing to the sound: These are a great set of headphones! The lows are brilliant & you can very much feel the bass right into your soul! The mids & highs are equally good and makes music extremely wholesome & enjoyable to listen to.\n\nIf you're looking for a good set of headphones and have been searching too much, please stop and buy this. Its well worth the money and you will listen to things you never heard before in a song! All the best!"}
{"review":"The sounds are loud and clear but these headphones are quite uncomfortable. When I put them on initially they seem quite soft and well fitting but after 10-15 minutes they feel really tight and my neck and ears start to hurt. They might be OK for someone with a smaller head but for someone with wide head like mine they can be really uncomfortable. I cant even wear it through a TV show without taking a break, definitely out of the question for movies. Pretty much out of the question for long periods of continuous listening."}
{"review":"really rich sounding headphones\nnot noise cutting but when you have them on they do some great\nsound cancelling\nbought for a podcast studio very good\nI love them\na must buy"}
{"review":"I use them for music and audio monitoring. Doesn't completely block out the outside noise, but it gets the job done well enough. For the price, great choice of headphones."}
{"review":"[Update: Dec 2014] so more than 2 years now, and these are still going great!! The thin cover around the cups has frayed just a little on one side, but it is not even noticeable. These headphones have been with me in my overseas trips, my outdoor camps, and often roughly packed along with my laptop to office. Highly recommended!\n\n[Original review, 2011]\nI wasn't too sure when I was buying these headphones -- but I saw all these nice reviews here and decided to give it a try.\n\nIt's been a year now and these headphones have been great. I second all those positive reviews up there (or down below)!"}
{"review":"Was looking for reasonably priced phones to use with my iPod while playing drums.  Suits my intended purpose well.  Excellent clarity and good dynamic range of sound.  Solid bass.  Very comfortable.  Not heavy nor presses hard on one's head.  Appreciate the long cord, mini jack with 1\/4\" adapter.  Recommended."}
{"review":"With the perception of music being being so subjective, I don't know that there can be much more to say than great cans for the money. However it is possible to say that there are segments of music where, say in a vocal the actual phrasing is difficult to hear and the misinterpreted lyrics have become almost cliche'. Well if you have know of any of those, where you can't quite get the lyric or the quality of that blue note, try listening on these. As other have said, there are better cans out there but not for this price. As for the size of the cup and it's fit over the ear. Ears come in a range of shapes and sizes. I have pretty normal size, perhaps medium size ears. These fit my ears, but without much room to spare and are otherwise well distributed without the feeling of any excess motion due to normal motion like walking etc. As such I find them pretty comfortable. If you have very large ears these may not give you good coverage and sound isolation. I gave them 5 starts and I suppose that's conditional. If they were 100 bucks maybe I'd only give em a 4. They are certainly a good buy."}
{"review":"These headphones are a great performer for their price. Hard to find any comparable closed can phones for this low a price. Be sure to note it has an 11' cord, so you won't be wearing these out on a walk."}
{"review":"I played cello for about 25 years, some piano and then the hands said, NO. As a result, when I listen to music, it has to sound like, well, music. Smaller headphones, and ear biuds are torture for me. The ear buds are waaaay too intrusive, smaller ear pieces tend to give ANY music a tinny dead sound and lest we forget, the solution for most small ear pieces is VOLUME. As in make it louder. Well, that does not work, because lets face it, the timber is now a LOUD tinny dead sound....\n\nBUT these headphones, MADE MY DAY. Love them for my stereo, and my Iphone and lests face it, I did not want a mega bass destroy my lower hearing or cook my food infra sonic attack. They are balanced, are delightful, feel good after 4 hours and the best thing of all, my music sounds like it should, at least, for headphones.\n\nI would not hesitate to give these as a gift which I did, TO ME!"}
{"review":"I have only been using them for a short time and I have to say they sound great.  They are very good at blocking all other noise while I am listening to them. I will mainly use them on my PC when I am listening to my music and do not want to disturb anyone.  The price on these are great!\n\nPros:  Price, Sound Quality, Weight and feel, comfortable, nice long cord.\n\nCons:  None so far!"}
{"review":"For $50 it is very good.  I gave it a 4 star because of the price.  If it was $150 I would have given it a 3 star or less.  I have Bose headsets and earbuds and it is comparable to the earbuds in quality.  I would say the quality is alittle bit better than  the earbuds.  Like I said for $50 it is very good.  It does keep out exterior noises to a certain degree.  I highly recommend this item.  I have never been disappointed in products bought at Amazon.com."}
{"review":"I've been waiting awhile now to write this review since I'm still unsure what I think of them.  They sound very good but not as amazing as some people clame. I am an audio major and have tried many headphones. I would have never went out n bought these my self as they were a present. Right now I mix with a $200 pair of Sony which I love. These comparied to the Sonys are acatuly not that mad. They're a nice headphone to get a different perspective on my mix.  The ear ear cups are a little shallow so they hurt after awhile. The overal build quality for the price is good. The cord and plug though are fairly cheap and don't look like they're going to last very long. The cord is way to long and not coiled. If it were a coiled cable I could see it lasting much longer since the coil really helps when the cable is tugged or stepped on. I have also used these for in my vocal booth and they seem to work fine but they do seem to leak quite a bit of sound if turned up to high. Not pro quality but still for an everyday consumer you may be able to find somthing a bit more comfortable with a nicer cord and plug for the same price."}
{"review":"AT Head phones Model ATH_M30\" The headphones are comfortable & easily adjustable . The high end sounds pretty \"tinny\" & the low ends are very weak . OK for normal rage of listening considering the under $50.00 range"}
{"review":"The reason I purchased these headphones was because of the great reviews on their sound quality and their price. I'm no pro, but they sound great, have a depth of field, nice highs and lows and are very comfortable even for long periods.\n\nHowever, the wiring into the headphone connector seems to be a bit shoddy. There is a spring to protect strain, etc. But from out of the box if the wire gets bumped or pulled while being plugged in I lose sound in the right ear. I was kinda disappointed. Other than the issue with the wiring these deserve 5 stars."}
{"review":"In my search for the \"right headphones\" I researched a few brands like sony, and sennsiher..don't know the speeling, anyhow I noticed good reveiws on these headphone so I jumped on them. My motiive for getting these were that I thought they would have a good bass response which I did not know wsa not the case. The sound is great don't get me wrong but not what I was looking for. I sent them back the next day to order the ATH-WS55i which are the solid bass model which comes with a microphone and i-phone controller. these were also ordered from amazon and they came in \"3 days\" directly from Japan. these were exactly what I was looking for because it kept the same great sound as a m30's with even more treble and great higs but the lows was what was the gift. so if you can afford to pay more for some good headphones go for ws55model"}
{"review":"sound good but not good bass. they do block out a lot of sound. they are also build good. had mines for about 7 month. and works good"}
{"review":"I'm no audiophile here, but I can tell the difference between these, my earbuds, and my older professional headphones. These are the best of the three, and my older headphones were more expensive. Bonus! They don't look as cool as some of the flashier headphones, but in my opinion they sound just as good, if not better. Audio Technica also provides a warranty, though I haven't bothered to fill it out yet.\n\nGripe: they fit too tight. Like, shrink your head tight. I'm not sure if I haven't figured out how to adjust them, or if I just have a fatter than average head, but after an hour, I have to take them off.\n\nThe tight fit does mean that there's only a fraction of sound leak going to the outside; people will only hear you if you blast them. Not too good at noise isolation, but that's not what I bought them for (nor what they were designed for). However, they are good enough to block out people talking, which is a plus while.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely buy them again. Being an engineer-y type, I can make the headphones fit well without too much modification. I would recommend them to my friends who aren't satisfied with basic headphones."}
{"review":"Bought these for my husband to use with his Kindle. The sound was great and all was well. But after 3 months they just quit working. Changed the batteries thinking that was it , but they are DOA. Won't buy another of this brand!\n\nAbove is my original review. I determined it might be the cord for the headphones so I called the company for a new one. It was so inexpensive that they just sent it to me free. It fixed the problem and hubby has his great sounding headphones again!  Oh yeah and to the know it alls who say there is no battery in these, FYI it's in the right headphone!"}
{"review":"[UPDATE: 7\/2\/14]\nI just wanted to post an update on my ATH-M30's. It's been more than 2 years (4\/2012) since I purchased these headphones, and I've learned a lot about audio since. Prior to owning these headphones, I refused to pay much more than $20 for a pair of headphones, but I took a leap of faith, and now the ATH-M30's set the standard for me. First, and foremost, my pair is still going strong despite lots of backpack abuse. I've said this in my original review, and I'll say it again, these headphones have excellent build quality and were clearly meant to last - these are the longest lasting pair of headphones I've ever owned to date. However, the ear cushions have lost some of their fluff over the years, and now a slight pressure\/rubbing will develop on my left ear after extended use, so not as comfortable as they once were, but still have a supurb sound, and the comfort is still adequate for shorter uses. I have replaced mine with a pair of higher end open-back headphones, so the M30's are now a ternary pair due to form factor, but I still love them, and still use them regularly enough as they are my go-to closed back headphones. At the end of day, I can't recommend these headphones enough if you're looking for a solid pair of headphones; you'll get your money's worth and then some.\n\n[Original Review]\nI was looking to replace my Sennheiser HD 202 Mk. II's for under $40. A very tall order. To add further, I had high requirements. At ~$45, these were well worth every penny, and I don't say that lightly as I *HATE* spending more than $20 for a pair of headphones. First off, I have a diverse taste in music, so sound accuracy takes precedence over bass distortion which some \"professional\" quality manufacturers do...*cough*Beats*cough*. I fancy the unusual fusion metals, such as folk-metal and symphonic-metal, but I also listen to techno\/trance, jazz, folk (especially Celtic folk) and even a bit of classical. I listen to some hip-hop\/rap, but mostly parodies. These headphones deliver the best quality I've ever head at all genres of music I've heard. Truly amazed. When I first opened these, the sturdy construction was immediately noticeable. Thick cable, gold-plated 3.5mm jack with metallic housing, with a metal spring on the wiring to prevent tension. The headband is also a relatively sturdy metal material, covered with padding and leather. There is extra wiring between the cuffs and the band. There was a lot of attention to detail to make sure these things last and it shows. Despite being pretty sturdy, these are actually very comfortable too. Fairly light, and heat on the ears isn't bad at all. I have about a 90 minute commute to school, and these don't cause the least bit of irritation. When first trying them, I admit I was a tad disappointed. But considering that the front panel audio is from a budget Thermaltake V4 case, it probably was my computer's fault. I also tried them on my phone (HTC Hero on Sprint), but noticed some distortion at max volume. Turns out I had a bass-boost effect to compensate for the lack of bass at low volumes from the HD202's. Turned that off, and have zero distortion. Highs were crisp and bass was deep, but not overpowering. I could easily identify and focus on any instrument at any volume level. I was even more impressed on my netbook since it can deliver higher volume. My biggest complaint is the ridiculous cord length of 11'. Considering these were designed for audio professionals and not everyday consumers, this is easily forgivable. I just tied up the excess and stick in a belt-loop and it's out of the way and perfectly tailored to my body size. I can whole-heartedly recommend these headphones to anyone seeking high-quality comfortable headphones. Don't let the price deceive you. These are easily the best pair of headphones I've ever owned."}
{"review":"When it comes to headphones, I'm a bit of a layman, but as someone who has spent years appreciating the more subtle layers of sound within music, I can tell you that these headphones are easily worth the cost. Fantastic for listening anywhere, in bed, while traveling, to music, games, spoken audio... If you need a solid set of quality, versatile headphones with great sound for under $100, grab these babies."}
{"review":"I just got these headphones today and I am so pleased with them! Prior to purchasing these, I used to use my boyfriend's Beats by Dre. I think these are just as good...if not better. The noise cancellation is insane! The only thing that bothers me is that the cord is super long- but I'm guessing that is because these are made for professional use. For the price, I can't complain. Definitely recommend!"}
{"review":"I have always used earbuds, most recently using the Koss sparkplugs. I listen to music at a desk for about 8 hours a day on average and was very pleased with my Koss earbuds. When they broke recently, I decided to go with some nicer over-the-ear headphones and I'm very glad that I did. They are more comfortable than I thought they would be and provide great isolation. The sound quality is amazing compared to my previous experience, but slightly quieter. Driving a much larger speaker requires more power and there is more sound loss, as some of it is reflecting off of the outside of your ear instead of being beamed straight to your eardrum. I would guess that there is about a 20% reduction on volume compared to my earbuds. This should not be a problem though unless you like to listen to your music at a rediculous level. With more power, like pluggen into a computer or home stereo, these headphones can handle more power than what I'm willing to subject my ears to. Overall, very happy with my purchase. Not as flashy as Dr. Dre beats but much cheaper and from what I have read, sound as good if not better."}
{"review":"My Bose headphones bit the dust (and also gave me a BLUE SCREEN when THEY blew - BRAND NEW expensive laptop, scared the heck outta me).  I purchased these based on reviews but I must say that my old Sony Professional Studio Monitors (from my radio talk show, these things are about ten years old) are much better.  I didn't realize Staples had headphones available to LISTEN with before purchase.  I wouldn't spend money on something you can't actually USE for demonstration.  There are headphones out there that can cost up to $500 or more (and my daughter had a pair), but really the difference in quality with the old Sony is negligible (although the Bose were superior, but expensive, and constantly blow up)."}
{"review":"I wear out headphones faster than anyone I know. Seems to make little difference how much or little I spend, they all break in the same spot. After breaking my last Sennheisers I needed an inexpensive replacement. These sound fantastic... here's hoping they last. Very, very snug fit for someone with a larger head.\n\nEdited after two years of nearly constant use: These headphones have been used daily for two years. I cannot believe it, but they perform as well as the day I bought them. The cord has become a bit stiff where it connects to the can, but they have withstood the test of a couple years by someone who is very hard on headphones. The pads are clean and in great shape. The sound is surprisingly good for the price. I have a large head and sensitive ears and scalp. These headphones are still the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned. I am impressed. I'm buying another pair, just in case."}
{"review":"I purchased these headphones because mine broke.  For the price that I got them for they are fantastic.  The most notable thing about them is that they are super light.  They fit very well and the foam pads to an amazing job at keeping sound in!  That is fantastic for me due to loving loud music.  The sound quality is clear, bass is good.  I was wearing them and just cant get over how light they actually are.\n\nThe one downside is that the cable is exposed where the headphones expand.  i don't know how often it could get snagged, but just a concern."}
{"review":"These are really comfortable to wear on your head, especially for a long time like watching Lord of the Rings, which I did with them last night :)\n\nI have a projector and I love watching movies on it but I have a housemate who wakes up really early so I have to keep it down. I bought these mostly for that and also to listen to vinyl records.\n\nThe cord is fairly long so I don't have a problem with it reaching to my bed, though I live in a very small room.\n\nThe headphones are of a high quality, which I expect from Audio-Technica. I've yet to be disappointed by this company.\n\nThe headphone jack is sturdy and made of high quality materials. What I really like is that they include a 1\/4\" adapter that actually screws onto the 1\/8\" plug on the headphones. It is really satisfying to screw it on and off because they fit so snugly together and you feel safe knowing that. haha!\n\nWhat I don't like about them is that my vinyl sounds more muddy with them. In fact, I can hardly tell I'm listening to a vinyl record, it sounds like a CD or an mp3. Oh, well.\n\nIf you want headphones for vinyl I have heard great things about Grado headphones. I wanted those but they were too expensive for me ($80). Headphones are not something I'm willing to pour a lot of money into."}
{"review":"These headphones are really good.  They are quite large and will take some time to get used to.  These headphones have some of the best bass compared to some high quality expensive headphones I have had or own currently.  The high's could be better, but the quality of your music is phenomenal.  However, there is some sound leakage.  Therefore beware of using this when in an office setting.  The 1\/4 inch adapter works well, but I do not get as much clarity when I hook it up to my mixing board.  These headphones are great for your computer and mp3 players, but not for studio sound recording."}
{"review":"I am very happy with the cushions on the ear pieces. They are great at blocking outside noise. Fairly lightweight. Sound quality is very good but, it could be a little better."}
{"review":"this is the first over the ear headphones ive bought so it took a while to get used to. a lot of reviews said it was uncomfortable, and they were kinda right. I had to readjust the positioning til i found the most comfortable place. The sound quality is pretty average. about the same sound as any $30 in-ear earphones. The isolation isn't great either (for example when im listening to music, any loud sounds will drown out the music i.e. Flushing toilet, airplane\/helicopter, lawnmower.\nThe spring protection is also a scam, does not protect the wire at all. its merely an ordinary spring attached to the end. doesn't protect the wire from any form of pulling.\n\nPros:\n -you get what you paid for\n -looks durable but we'll see how long it lasts\n -extra long cord good for working in office, (but not very portable)\n -looks good idk...\nCons:\n -spring protection on jack is bs\n -slightly uncomfortable. you'll need to stretch it out a bit b4 it becomes comfortable\n -Long cord is not too portable, mostly for in-home use\n\nbottom line don't think that your getting like $100 earphones at a low price. these are $40 earphones."}
{"review":"These are great $50 headphones. They are not audiophile quality, but if you really are one, then you wouldn't be looking at $50 headphones. These are however, fantastic at reproducing sound faithfully. I would recommend burning them in, as it does affect the sound. I played sine sweeps though them for 50+ hours (not all at once) and they really do sound better. The highs are now more mellow and less poppy, and the lows are much warmer.\n\nIf you intend to use these as portable headphones, you may run into some problems. The cord really is 11' long, really nice for the studios for which this set is made for, but a bit cumbersome for on-the-go listening. I suggest you use some of the black cable ties that come with it and loop some of the cable. My loop is about a foot and a half away from the jack, and four feet from the actual headphones. That way, I can be able to put all the excess cable in my pocket and still have some room at the end of the cord for plugging into things such as guitar amplifiers. I would also suggest you buy a decent headphone amp, such as the&nbsp;. It really improves the sound out of an iPod or MP3 player.\n\nSo, to wrap it all up:\n\nTHE GOOD:\n* Cable - Strong and thick, and plenty of room to spare.\n* Output jack - Very high quality, spring protected to prevent stress, and the screw-on 1\/4\" adapter is great.\n* Overall quality - Sturdy, they look nice, and also could probably survive a pretty good drop.\n* Mids - Very nice right out of the box. These headphones are very flat, and do not favor bass or highs. I personally look for that in quality headphones.\n\nTHE BAD:\n* Ear pads - Uncomfortable, they should be bigger. Also, the material is a bit flimsy and very scratchy. I would not wear these around my neck.\n* Ear swivels - They squeak a bit, just annoys me.\n\nTHE OK:\n* Headband - Nicely padded, however, it clamps down with some force. It may be uncomfortable for people with large heads after a couple hours of listening.\n* Sound isolation - These are not noise cancelling headphones, and I didn't expect them to be. However, I was surprised with the amount of outside noise it blocked.\n* Bass response - I like it the way it is, but if you like big, car-booming bass, then you will be disappointed. It is hard to \"feel\" the bass in these headphones without turning up the volume very loud.\n\nOverall, I would recommend these headphones, but depending on what you like, these may not be for you."}
{"review":"Sound 5\/5. I really loved the sound of these headphones.  Listening to my favorite tracks with these was like listening to them for the first time.  One minor nit was that on some songs the base seemed a little undefined.\n\nComfort 1\/5.  I wear glasses and even after 1\/2 hour my ears would be getting crushed.  I bought these to that I could have music at work all day so this just does not work for me and I will have to return them.  It is too bad I really love how well they sound."}
{"review":"When I first bought myself this pair of headphones, it was my first real foray into higher quality audio headsets. Before, I was content with whatever nice looking $20 pair I could buy at the local Target or Best Buy. The sound quality on this is amazing, bass is never too harsh, trebles never too tremulous and the mids never too muffled out by the extremes. However, I do have one issue, and that prevents me from giving this a full 5 stars. Once I started listening with the ATH-M30s, I noticed that the sound signature wasn't even, in that the right cup was significantly quieter, or had less range, than the left earcup. I assumed that was my perception because the left earcup usually has more bass, but that wasn't the case. The right side did indeed have some sort of strained quality to its sound. I don't know if it's a hardware issue or something."}
{"review":"I didn't expect a whole lot for their low price.  I compared them to a couple Sony models and a few other brands which suggested setting their EQ once they were shipped.  These came perfect out of the box.  Bass is nice, not too heavy.  You can hear every beat and even sounds in the background that other headphones would wash out.  Buy these."}
{"review":"Almost anyways :) I checked a lot of reviews and ratings before choosing these headphones, and even though I just got them today I have to say I love them! I've been looking for over the ear headphones, like the ones I had when I was a kid...well my dad's headphones actually, waaaaaaay back in the 70's when everything seemed to be made better. The sound quality is great, and I've had them on for over an hour and they are quite comfortable. I can hear everything you are supposed to hear, what a great listening experience. I barely go halfway on the volume, and it's quite loud. When you crank the volume, the quality does not suffer. Also, the headphones don't feel like they are going to break, and the sturdy chord and jack really make this a quality item."}
{"review":"These headphones arrived to us zippidy-quick!  I ordered them for my husband who plays in rock bands, and after trying them out briefly he told me they work GREAT!  I asked him if the sound quality was the same or better than he'd expected and he said \"better\".  They arrived very carefully and beautifully packaged, and truly live up to the name of \"Professional Headphones\".  Happy hearing!!"}
{"review":"I'm not an expert on headphones or audio equipment, and I only bought these headphones for listening to music at work (and blocking out surrounding noise). That being said, this does the job very well. I listen to music with a lot of bass, and I find the sound quality to be very crisp and clear. The price was also fantastic, I know people who have paid much more for their headphones and were jealous when mine came in the mail.\n\nI will say that I find them to be a bit uncomfortable at times. Maybe I have bigger ears than the average person, but  they don't go over my entire ear so I start to feel pressure after wearing them for a couple hours. I sometimes have to fold up my earlobes if I want to wear them for a longer period of time. This may not be the case with you but it's something to keep in mind if you've had that issue with other headphones."}
{"review":"I have used it for about 3 months. The sound is amazing. I had been afraid about the quality after reading most of the reviews rating one star. So I use it very carefully but still frequently. Nothing goes bad until now. Hope my headphone won't get broken in the coming 3 or 4 years.\nMy only cencern is about the too long cable. I had considered cutting some from it. It not easy to use the headphone outside."}
{"review":"These headphones are very comfortable and provide excellent sound.  Good bass, as well as a balanced sound.  The music can not be heard by others, even when turned up to maximum volume."}
{"review":"I purchased this because of the reviews online. After less than one month, the right side stopped working completely. Even cheaper ones I have worked longer. This is very disappointing."}
{"review":"I just got these from Amazon today. Fast and speedy delivery via Ensenda,which was great. I opened the package up and plugged these headphones into my Pioneer VSX 1021-K (purchased 2 of them from Amazon) I then selected a variety of tunes on my Logitech Squeezebox Touch (also purchased from Amazon) These headphone are light weight and very comfortable. The sound they offer is very good with nice and  true, accurate, clean, and crisp sound at all ranges. Nice highs, nice mid range, and surprisingly nice bass. I didn't crank them up too loud, as I want to break them in for some hours prior to blasting them. I'm very pleased with my purchase. Given the sub $50 price, I'm even happier with this purchase. I gave 4 stars due to lack of use. Once I get some time on them, I may come back and add the 5th star. I'd recco these to anyone not looking to break the bank but still wanting a high quality sound from a nice looking set of comfortable headphones. Once again, Amazon comes through."}
{"review":"Great headphones for ~$40. Very good for studio use. At 90 percent or so sound might get a little grainy depending on what genre you're listening to but at 80-85%, the headphones are loud and soooo clear. Buy them while they last, seriously."}
{"review":"I'll keep it simple these headphones don't disappoint. For price and performance I can't imagine anything else coming close. I would recomend them to anybody in the market for something in the middle from pro to entry headphones."}
{"review":"These headphones are great and at a great price, my last pair of headphones cost twice as much as these but had less than half the audio quality.  These are very comfy to wear and the sound quality is amazing. I mostly use these while watching tv or movies on my pc, and i don't mind wearing these for long lengths of time."}
{"review":"I purchased two Koss headphones and two Sennheiser headphones. All four are in the 50 to 100 dollar range. None of those four sound as clear or as sharp as the ATH M30. I search no more. ATH M30 is the real deal."}
{"review":"I'll confess, I'm disappointed with the Audio-Technica ATH-M30 \"Professional\" headphones. They sound good, but they are too uncomfortable for extended wear. I don't consider myself to have large ears, but the cups are too small\/shallow to fit over my ears without deforming them. I will probably return them."}
{"review":"I had the BOSE AEII's before I got these. I returned the BOSE because they did not produce $150 sound. I saw the reviews on these and decided to dive in since they were only $40. Dang... wish I had just gotten these in the first place. I listen to a lot of Alternative and \"Jam Band\" (deadmau5)music. The BOSE were very clear and I felt good about the quality, but there was absolutely no bass. I do not need a lot of bass, but my Blackberry earbuds did a better job with the bass! With these, the bass response is great. It never gets overwhelming, but it is always very crisp and accurate. I have not run into any issues with it being muddy or drowning out the mids or highs.\n\nI also feel that these headphones are very comfortable and do a good job with sound isolation. I fly quite often and these have been great. There is no case to protect them, but they are fairly robust, so I have not been worried about them breaking. My biggest concern was that I did not want to bother other people and these do a great job keeping the sound in.\n\nOne thing to note about flying with these is that the volume has to be up quite loud to drown out the ambient noise from flying, so after a 2 hour flight I do notice that my ears hurt from the loud noise. I have used the BOSE QC in the past and they do a much better job for flying, but I am not in the market for a $300 pair of headphones, so these are perfect for me (I am usually in the air for 45-65 min and I do not experience any ear pain)."}
{"review":"I bought these to use at work as I did not want to bring my ATH-M50's to work.  Off my iPhone they sound pretty good, off my laptop or my portable DAC\/AMP they sound pretty amazing, not as good as more expensive headphones but for $40.00, pretty amazing."}
{"review":"Really comfortable, long cord and easily adjustable. Keeps out sound better than I expected and the sound quality is great. Pin is very high quality with a screw on 1\/4 connector that is easy to swap between."}
{"review":"I'm going to provide feedback for three devices I recently purchased for my Zune and Sansa MP3 players.  I'll probably post this under each of the product reviews.  The devices are the ATH-M30 headset, the Klipsch S4 in ear buds, and the JVC Xtreme Xplosives HA-FX1X in ear buds.  Now throwing in the AT headphones are a bit like comparing apples to oranges but these are three products I wanted to try as they all got pretty good reviews.  I think in hindsight, if I stopped at buying any one of these products I would have been happy but since I now have all three, here goes.\n\nThe AT headphones seem to be built well and have an uncoiled cord that is about 10ft long.  It seems well built as well do the headphones themselves.  Sound quality is very good and the headphones are comfortable.  I would say that they are very accurate sounding with nice highs and smooth bass.  They seem to produce less volume than some other headsets that I've listened to but have adequate volume -- for me anyway.  These were priced between the Klipsch and the JVC earbuds at around $40.\n\nThe Klipsch S4 earbuds were the most expensive of the three at around $60.  They too seem very accurate where none of the frequency ranges seem artificially boosted or distorted in any way.  They have more volume than the AT's but not as much as the XX's.  The only thing I'm not too fond of with these is the cord -- it seems a bit delicate.  Only time will tell how well it holds up.  And the fact that for me anyway, I find myself having to grab the wire support instead of the actual bud in order to remove them from my ears.  But overall I'd rate them the best sounding of the 3 and worth the money I spent.\n\nFinally the JVC Xtreme Xplosives.  These were priced the least expensive and I really bought them to see if I made a wrong choice in paying for the more expensive S4's.  As it turns out I do like the sound of the S4's considerably better than the XX's.  Not that they're bad when compared to most other buds I've used, but they do seem to have the boosted bass that doesn't seem as clean and smooth as the other two headphones.  The mids seem to be boosted too.  I do like the build quality of the cord much better than the S4's though.  The cord is a bit thicker and is the same even where the wires \"Y\" whereas on the S4's the wire thins out.  They also produce the most volume by a good margin so if head banging R&R is your thing, I would think they would fit the bill just fine.\n\nOne more thing for those wondering what's in the package.  S4's have 3 sizes of earbuds and a carrying case.  Not to be outdone, the XX have 3 sizes of earbuds and a case too.  The AT's have a 1\/4th\" adapter plug.\n\nTo summarize, I'd rate them as follows.\n\nSound quality:  1st place goes to the S4's, 2nd to the AT's and 3rd place to the XX's\n\nVolume:  XX's, S4's, AT's\n\nOverall:  S4's, AT's, XX's.  Your mileage may vary."}
{"review":"Delivery was on time and the product is good. I use the headphones for listening to music at work (office-work) and if I don't want to be distracted I can put them on and listen to music with the volume turned to 3% strength (basically almost silent) and I don't hear anything from the other workers. I also use them for home recording\/mixing\/mastering and they are very good for all recording. They are flat which helps for mastering and they are also very clear so you hear ALL flaws in your recording. Good product and a very nice price."}
{"review":"I would not define myself as an audiophile, but I do not have a tin ear either. I was looking for an over-the-ear set of headphones that were both affordable, and would satisfy my gaming and music interests. I took a chance on the ATH-M30, not because I expected low quality but because I felt I might be putting the headphones to a use for which they were not expressly designed.\n\nI've run the headphones through the paces for which I intend to use them and am impressed. They handle explosions from games as well as explosions from symphonies. I can distinguish individual instruments in Rachmanivov's Symphonic Dances, directional movements in Mass Effect 3, find vocal and instrumental balance is an Andrea Revel song; and they reproduce the full range of tones from bass to highs without distortion. I highly recommend these headphones."}
{"review":"Bought these to use in the lab on campus, so the closed design was essential.  At first they were just okay, but as you play them and they break in, they smooth out a little bit.  I am used to a open back pair of Sennheisers, so these sound a little cramped to me, but that is just my personal taste.  For the price they are a really solid pair of headphones.  The cable is very high quality.  No flair, just great function."}
{"review":"As a non-elitist\/casual listener, I simply wanted a good pair of headphones for studying in the library to drown out other noise. These do the trick, look pretty slick, and sound great as an added bonus! It's worth it to note that these are studio headphones, so not necessarily noise cancelling or isolating, but being over-ear, they are more than enough with me with some good music on. They feel extra comfortable on the ears, but I haven't tried them on for more than an hour at most. These are a steal with Prime shipping and all, would highly recommend for the college student looking for a decent noise damper."}
{"review":"my son wanted isolating headphones for Christmas. I have used lots of AT products and their quality is generally reputable in the pro-audio world with a few hits and misses. But generally a solid name. Cheap consumer level cans? well they received decent reviews here and for a child they couldn't be any worse with what you can find at target....\n\nyou know what? for the money, they are fantastic. they are not perfect, and I wouldn't mix live or  tweak a recording with them, but for general listening, they are great. (I've had to use far worse walking into venues with an installed sound system). at work, for travel, for the kids, or just generally around the house, yes, they'll do the job nicely. They are not top-of-the-line SQ cans, but for the money, they get a solid vote."}
{"review":"I got these for my Korg Pandora Mini to use mainly outdoors. I figured for the price I can afford to beat them up. After getting them though, I was like geesh, these look nice! They have a nice long cord, and a spring like reinforcement at the place where cords break. They are so comfortable, I forget to take them off. Probably why they put such a nice long cord on them?\n\nUpon close observation, these guys put a lot of thought into the design of these headphones. I have not tried sitting on them or stepping on them yet, and do not plan to. But if that happens, the places they might break, I can already see ways and means of \"Mickey Mousing\" a quick fix for them. The engineers left plenty of meat on the break points so they can be mended.\n\nThe sound quality to me is \"good enough\". I have spent fortunes chasing the sound thing, and when my Pops was alive, had him hook my stuff up to Scopes and instruments to see how good my stuff was. But, after being around bombs and explosions and countless machine gun bursts, and all kinds of other loud noises all my life, I am happy to hear anything that is not painful to my eras or psyche. To me these sound just fine. I hear everything from my guitar I want to, and that is that. If I am missing something, its probably a good thing; I am not exactly Buckethead on guitar if you know what I mean?\n\nLike I alluded to, I have spent fortunes in the past for sound. These were like $50 or $60 bucks, somewhere in there, and I hear no difference from the expensive stuff I have. A quick listen on my MacBook Pro to my studio stuff, it sounds to me as good or better maybe than anything else.\n\nI really doubt you can do better for the price, and I would suggest that if you are banging your head against the Internet shopping still, you can stop here and click \"add to cart\" and go get some sleep. Mine came so fast I was amazed! To get things in Saipan is usually a long ordeal. But not so here, mine got here in like 6 days! Colorado to Saipan from other outfits has taken 9 MONTHS (still waiting on some things!), so I am 100% going Amazon and Amazon ONLY from here on out until I get back to Hawaii. And even then, probably stick with Amazon. I have not got a bum deal yet!\n\nEnjoy these headphones. They are pretty darn nice for the money!"}
{"review":"I have had these headphones for about 3 hours and they have been on my head for about 3 hours. I bought these on a whim because I was so sick of my iPhone earbuds falling out at work. I have owned some $20-30 Sony headphones before, but these blow them out of the water - obviously.\n\nI am not an audiophile. I didn't even really read the specs. I just bought these based off many of the positive reviews. You will not be disappointed. The bass is very deep and rich. The symbols sound tight. I can hear backup signers and other instruments that I have never been able to hear before in some of the songs that I listen to.\n\nWow. And they are really comfortable."}
{"review":"I'll admit. I have huge ears. Yeah the sound is great. But after about 30 minutes my ears hurt. Yeah not really a fault of the product but my big ears are hurtin'! Big ears beware!"}
{"review":"Great headphone. One recommendation, buy a Fiio E6 headphone amplifier for it! Makes it really come to life with my iphone 4! With these headphones and amp. it cost me 80 bucks and its the best investment you can make!"}
{"review":"I am no expert in headphones, but I can tell that these are great! They certainly outperform all the headphones that I've owned, and my decent desktop speakers as well. Very comfortable as well, I wear them practically all day. The long cord is perfect if you are moving around a lot. I would say, however, that they are more suitable for rock than classical music."}
{"review":"I purchased these headphones to use on my job.  They are excellent.  The fit is nice, the sound quality is nice, the cord is very long, the headphones are light weight and fit nicely over the ears.  I would definately purchase again."}
{"review":"If you are looking for very good sound, comfortable fit and a very fair price without the annoyance of buds this is an excellent product. I did not want to spend a lot of money and after some research decided to try the M30's and have been very pleased."}
{"review":"I haven't tried many headphones, but I am very picky.  These headphones are amazing.  Very clear and precise.  I accedently stepped on them and a piece of plastic came off of one of the cups.  Now I have to readjust everytime I want to put them on, but I love them so much I don't care.  You CAN have high quality for such a low price.  Would recommend to anyone."}
{"review":"I am listening to these right now. I own a number of headphones - Bose noise canceling, Logitech, Beats, Turtlebeach - some of these cost me hundreds of dollars. Granted the other headphones have other purpose - Air travel, Video game playing, talking,,, but the ATH-M30's have the richest sound, with smooth deep lows and a sweet mid range - very good for listening to music from my computer, Ipod and Stereo. It is interesting to compare my earbuds and other headphones, for the price - WOW these are solid, quality headphones. You really can't go wrong with these unless you looking to spend hundreds more."}
{"review":"I like this headphones they sound great, clearness and quality sound, perfect and pretty much its your moneys worth but the 11 feet cable lenght kills it, it's too damn long also also its not too comfortable when around your neck."}
{"review":"My workplace is pretty loud.  We have maybe ten or more vacuum pumps that are constantly going, and one sits right next to my desk and actually sends a low vibration through it.  Because of that, I desired headphones that really did give proper sound isolation -- and unfortunately, these weren't it.  They aren't bad!  It's just that they aren't perfect.  I have trouble listening to classical music because outside noise bleeds in, and unless the volume is high enough I can still hear people talking around me.  I guess the main thing was that I was spoiled by a pair of in-ear Sennheiser headphones that I bought two years ago that not only had pretty good sound quality but were like ear plugs--in fact, better than them since once you had a little bit of music you really couldn't hear anything around you (and were perfect for phasing out silly conversations that I didn't want to have to be inflicted with, not to mention studying in the library).\n\nIn comparison to that, these headphones are lacking. However!  They're not that bad.  I'm not an audiophile so I can't break down the sound very fluently, but it all sounds pretty good to me.  For $50, I guess I got a relatively decent pair of headphones, that while they weren't exactly what I had hoped, are good enough for more or less my daily needs.  They have a couple of other downsides, too, but they're bearable (i.e. the huge size, the squishing of ears after too many hours of listening).  Otherwise, they're pretty comfortable, and they don't leak too bad as long as you have them on your ears or with the pads closed together, so they're good for quiet places where you don't have to worry so much about sound isolation.  If I break these at some point I'll be happy since it will give me an excuse to buy another pair, but otherwise they're decent for a decent price."}
{"review":"I bought new headphones because I thought there was something wrong with them, seems its just my computers fault... My old MDR-V600's are definitely better.. I can hear all the individual sounds.. These headphones sound flat.. and like everything is mashed together... good deal for $50 but my decade old Sony's are better."}
{"review":"I received these headphones today and they are everything that I expected after reading plenty of reviews and hearing only good things. However, after initially being seduced by an attractive price of $50.93, these headphones have cost me around $85.00.\n\nThis is because I live in Canada, and was forced to pay the overpriced duties and similar fees of shipping company 'DHL EXPRESS' that is set as default by retailer 'Audiosavings'. If you live outside of the USA, I suggest you do your research to find the cheapest way of having the product shipped to you, then requesting that Audiosavings choose your preferred method of shipping, or consider another retailer all together."}
{"review":"Got these to replace my Sennheiser EH-150 that are dead after 2-3 years of regular use on computer. I'm extremely satisfied with my new Audio-Technica ATH-M30. Overall sound is better than my former Sennheiser's. Natural and balanced sound, well defined and spacious from bass to high treble. Every note is so clear, just enjoy listening to music with these! Light enough and comfortable. Practical long cord. I'm very happy with these, just hope they gonna last long!"}
{"review":"These are the cheaper versions of the M50s, and for good reason: sound and comfort are definitely a step down. However, they are pretty good and have big bass like the M50s without being overpowering. My ears really started overheating though, and the M50s do not seem to have that problem at all. Also, the straight cable is waaaaaayy too long. It's just ridiculous why anyone would make such a long cable. And it's not even removable so you could put in a shorter one.\n\nIt's pretty unfortunate because these actually sound really good (I LOVED the sound), but I can't get past the overheating and cable length problems: I'm sending these back. Get the M50s, they are the best I've ever bought. Try getting the coiled version if you can, they'll be totally worth it then."}
{"review":"I can just say that those earphones are totaly AWSOME. Its so compftable to wear them!!! And the sound WOW!!! The best earphones I EVER bought. I can just say totaly worth the money. Buy them and you will definitely be happy with them. I mostly use them for gaming, music and watching movies. With the long cable i can la on my bed a still watch a movie!!!!"}
{"review":"This product has a great value and can fully justify its $50 price. I'm a headphone rookie and this is actually the first headphone I purchased separately from a iphone earphone. I use it for normal daily use of listening to music and communications. The bottom line is, it doesn't require a battery while producing a similar sound quality as a headphone like a $299 monster headphone, which I tried several times before. It also provides a reasonable amount of noise reduction, though not so comparable to any headphones labeled \"noise-canceling headphones\".\n\nThe downside is that the wire is a little bit too long for daily use. I wouldn't recommend it if you want to plug it on your ipod and walk around. It just does not look cool at all: it should be used indoors only.\n\nThe skins on the cushion peels off after a month of use, which is sooner than i expected.\nThe comfortless lasts for an hour to two before your ear aches a little bit.\n\nAnother bottom line: My grandpa loves it so much!\n\nI would give it a 4.5 but considering its price it give it a 5."}
{"review":"I was in the market for a pair of mid-priced studio style head phones. After reviewing many models, I chose to go with this pair.\nThe Audio-Technica's has a gentle feel on your head, and can be worn for long periods of time with out any discomfort. I mainly bought these to listen to music, and to drown out sounds from around the house while working on 3d assets , or other creative items. But I must say that the highs, mids, and lows are a vast improvement over my small ear buds that I had before.\n\nThe cons that I do have are there is a slight \"crackle\" on some types of music that make it more noticeable. I am not sure if this will go away after awhile as it has been less happening, or my pair is defective.\n\nThe other is there is no type of small cable management tie that you could use with the set when you bring it with you. But This did not effect my rating as it is clearly marked in the information of the product, I ended up using the cable tie from my guitar cable.\n\nIf you are in the market for a great head phones for the money, then these are the pair for you."}
{"review":"I've blown a bunch of money on headphones over the last few months. Generally trying everything under $60. These are the best to me. They feel the most quality, everything from the cable to the plug itself all feels quality made. It is very comfortable with ample padding around the ear. And the sound has all the richness you could ever want. The problem with most headphones I tried was the lack of bass. Even in the review where people said it had plenty of bass, they were wrong. At least in comparison to this. This has those bass booming beats that you can feel. I just love these things. I'm glad I got them. Now I have to go to eBay to list all the other ones I bought from Sony, Sennheiser, Koss, Behrringer, and JVC."}
{"review":"Sounds good, comfortable, good quality wire, decent price.  I got these to replace a set of senheisers that were uncomfortable since you couldn't rotate the cups.  These are very comfortable."}
{"review":"These headphones are very comfortable and have great sound.  I'm no audiophile but I listen to a lot of different types of music, all of which sound great.  My ears heat up a little bit after extended use, but this is to be expected with any set of headphones.  I would like if they folded up compactly but they feel very durable so I'm not complaining.  The cord and plug seem durable and I'm able to throw them into my backpack with my laptop without them breaking."}
{"review":"Best $40 I've ever spent.  Sounds so good I started crying, I couldn't believe what I was missing in life.  This headset is not to be believed, just incredible sound.  They are extremely comfortable, especially when compared to the standard issue earphones.  I was looking into getting a beats set...  but for the same price I could buy four pairs of these and enjoy nearly identical sound, which will last slightly longer due to a better build quality.\n\nWhile they aren't extremely easy on the eyes, your ears won't let you take them off.  A slightly longer than needed cord for use with an ipod, but just mind blowing sound.  Purchasing another pair after I submit this."}
{"review":"This is my first time reviewing a product purchased from Amazon.  I just opened these Audio Technica ATH-M30 headphones tonight and I was hoping they would live up to the positive reviews.  I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed!  As many else who have reviewed these, I am not an audiophile.  However, I appreciate good sound quality.  The sound of these are really fantastic for the price.  As many have said, they have heard better at 3 or 4 times the price.  I have not done a side by side comparison to Bose or Dr. Dre Beats, but I have listened to those other brands at the Apple store.  I just remember how good and full the music sounded - with nice bass and a full mid and treble sound.  However, I was not willing to pay $200-$300 for a good sounding pair of headphones.  When I put these on for the first time tonight, I was really blown away.  The big sound of the music was a treat, and seemed quite comparable to those higher end brands.  I am not speaking to every little detail, and I am sure many can point out the subtle nuances that make those other better and worth their price.  But for general listening enjoyment, I don't believe the average person would be able to tell the difference.\n\nTo address some of the other negative reviews.  I was worried that these would not be comfortable based on what others have said.  I was quite happy how they felt on my ears.  I have an average sized head and they were not too tight at all.  There was also plenty of room for them to fit on a larger head.  The padding on these is very generous, and from what I can tell, they do a good job of keeping the music in and the outside noise out.  The build quality is also very nice.  The cord is long, but that's not a problem for my purposes.  I do quite a bit of travel for my job and wanted a pair of headphones to block out the plane engine noise so I could actually hear my music or movie and not be disturbing to my immediate neighbors.  I will see how they perform on the plane and then provide and update to this review.\n\nI can say that these would be very hard to beat for the price.  If you are on the fence about whether to get these, I hope this helps."}
{"review":"This are very comfortable and are well made. I love the bass and clarity. The only con so far is that the cable is very long and can get in the way."}
{"review":"I bought the headphones to use it for home recording of some amateur guitar band music.\nThe sound quality is decent especially considering the rather cheap price, however, the product is really uncomfortable for me.\nI don't have big ears, they are just in the normal range as most people's ears. The headphones however, make a very painful mechanical pressure on them in short time.\nActually, I can't wear them more than 20 minutes in one session because it become really annoying.\nThe real problem with the headphones generally, that you can't try them usually before you decide to buy."}
{"review":"Hi guys,\nI wanted to thanks you to having help me to choose this headphone which I can testify is very good and useful. I recommand please try by yourself.\nFabrice from Paris."}
{"review":"They are transparent. If your recording\/mix\/master has any issues, this headphones will let you knoe.\n\nThey are cristal clear, you can use them to mix recordings, and they will help you a lot. Also, they are very good at detecting any kind of noise so you can resolve it.\n\nATTENTION: They are not as loud and closed as other headphones, so for recording I wouldnt suggest them (for those purposes i use the AKG44).Also, it's true, the bass is kind of low, and the mid frequencies are a bit high, but I find this VERY USEFULL for getting clean mixing."}
{"review":"These headphones are pretty good, I like them because they're good and because when they're on my ears they feel pretty good. Overall They are good."}
{"review":"Very pleased with this set.  I have never splurged on a true high end set of head phone and these are at the high end among my previous purchases.  They sound really good to me, not too bassy but very rich.  I am noticing small details in songs that I have not noticed before.  I can understand why some people might consider these uncomfortable, I do notice my ears feel like I have been wearing headphones when I take these off after a long session but I would not say it hurts, and the feeling passes quickly.  The other important consideration for me was how loud these would be to my co workers, so far no complaints even after I invited comments when listening to Leftfield at enjoyable volume.  So here is me hoping I don't sit on them like I usually do :("}
{"review":"I wanted bang-for-the-buck headphones, and these fit the bill nicely. I saw that one reviewer seemed to be of the opinion that these headphones were built TOO heavily -- while that reviewer may have given it a lower rating because of its heavy construction, the build quality is one of the main reasons I got myself a pair. I expect these headphones to last a good long time!\n\nI had a pair of cheap Sennheiser headphones (HD 202 ii or something like that) for a while, but eventually one of the wires\/connections broke and the sound no longer worked properly in one ear. However, these Audio-Technica headphones feature a heavy-gauge wire which ought to stand up to the daily abuse of a clumsy, klutzy, wire-jerking person like me. Also, my old Sennheisers didn't fully fit over my ear, so they were painful to wear after 2-3 hours. These Audio-Technicas cover my ears and are quite comfortable.\n\nThe sound is great. I'm no golden-eared expert, but it seems pretty well-balanced."}
{"review":"I was really surprised at the quality of sound. They are light and comfortable. After wearing them for a while however, the ears get a bit warm."}
{"review":"I bought these headphones to help me study (I'm one of those people that like to listen to music when I'm doing homework, house music for math).  I'm not a big audiophile and this is my second pair of headphones since 2004, but the quality of these are really great.  Highs and lows sound good to me, and the build is solid.  I loop these around my backpack top strap and it gets beaten up pretty good on commutes and moving around, but it's still works fine.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that it hurts my ears after a while, but that might be due to my big ears (like Will Smith)."}
{"review":"The sound is superb--rich, full, nuanced; the cord is nice and long, allowing freedom of movement. These rock! My 19-yr. old musician son loves his gift."}
{"review":"I have used these headphones a lot over the last few days for many different types of music listening.  The sound quality is very rich and vibrant sounding.  If you adjust them correctly most surrounding\/background noise is unheard.  This is likely caused by the very comfortable padded headphones.  The bass is also very good.  They hold up nicely to both movies and music.  The cord for the headphones is VERY long, but I can understand why that would be useful for the non-recreational users.  Overall very happy!"}
{"review":"Ourchased as a gift for a gamer who is delighted with the audio quality and comfortof the equipment.  They are serving their intended purpose well."}
{"review":"This is my first pair of REAL headphones, and I must say, no more cheapies for me after these. They didn't sound great at first, but after they were \"broke in\", which took about ~12 hours of listening, they are absolutely amazing. They feel very sturdy and like they will last a long time. The cord is extremely durable. It's kind of long, about 12 feet, so I was worried I would have it messed up in no time. I was most definitely wrong about this! I have ran over it with my chair several times and even caught the cat chewing on it too. It still looks just like it did the day I got it!\n\nA++ would buy again!"}
{"review":"After reading the reviews I chose these - I am blown away by how much better they are than the different headphones I have been using.  Unbelievable, even just using them to listen to iTunes tracks from my computer...!"}
{"review":"After owning a pair of Skullcandy Hesh headphones with poor sound quality, I decided it was time for an upgrade. The M3Os I bought for myself arrivedlast month.. I plugged them into my laptop and listened to them. I was really impressed. The bass is a huge improvement over the Hesh, going for a sharp, full sound instead of just making your cans thump. The sound quality is great. With my old Hesh, I was missing half the song! The headphones are pretty comfortable, after wearing them for 2 hours straight, I've experienced no discomfort, despite having a ring in my ear cartilage.\n\nAfter a month of GENTLE use, they stopped working. The wire was intact, everything. These are a scam, do not buy! I'm so mad because I feel like I've been scammed! I spent all my spare money on them..."}
{"review":"After reading reviews for these headphones, I though I might just have to give these little guys a try. After receiving these bad boys in the mail, I was instantly pleased with the high quality these headphones truly are. They do no feel plastic nor cheap in any sense what so ever. With a thick long flexible cord only adds to the greatness of these headphones.\n\nAlthough the build quality is super, the comfort wasn't so much. After wearing them for about 30 or more minuets a day, they start to feel really uncomfortable. To the point I was forced to leave them off for an hour or so, before the un-comfortableness caused by the headphones returned back to normal.\n\nBuild quality - 9\/10\nSound quality - 10\/10\nComfort  - 4\/10"}
{"review":"I just ordered my second pair of ATH-M30s. Whether I'm writing shell scripts, editing video, or taking a music break, these provide the clarity highs, solid midrange, and accurate bass I require. My real favorite headphones are from Grado's line, but their open backs make them unsuitable to my office environment. By way of comparison, I can't stand Sony's monitor-series cans, which I find screechy and gutless; I find the Sennheiser sound dull and far-away. I nearly went for a pair of AKG's, but, for something that sits on my desk in plain view, they represent a larger investment to be replaced if stolen.\n\nThe leatherette ear pads on my first set of ATH-M30s have begun to disintegrate, leaving little black flecks of headphone-dandruff everywhere. Hence the new pair, and the missing star from the review. That first pair served me well for 4 years before the flaking set in, and they still sound as good as ever. The lack of replaceable ear pads is disappointing -- it's a lousy way to turn an otherwise solid product into a disposable one -- but, for $50, I can live with that.\n\nEDIT: It turns out that the ear pads are replaceable, both easily and cheaply. A new pair was all of $8.14 shipped from Audio Technica Parts in Ohio (email parts@atus.com). No instructions were included, but it was easy to see from the new pads how to remove the old ones. The change took only a couple of minutes, and resulted in an as-new set of headphones."}
{"review":"I first bought these headphones in 2009, Ive used them since for recording and mastering my music, I swear by them, ill use these over studio monitors, sadly tho, they finally broke the weekend of Jan 8th 2012. The wire in my right ear finally wore through from rubbing on the plastic in the pad swivel, i tried fixing them but it wasn't happening. So I bought another pair."}
{"review":"My son ordered on line, without trying. WHAT A GREAT surprise! They are better than the on-the-ear Beats by Dre. If your looking for mid range bass, these are for you!"}
{"review":"I needed a set of headphones that are comfortable,well built,sound good[for gaming],and wouldn't give my wallet a limp! These fit the bill.[no pun intended!]I'm on my computer for hours on end. Nobody can hear me no matter how loud the volume is. And,my ears don't hurt from the headphones either. Get a pair,you won't be sorry!"}
{"review":"Very solidly built....no cheap plastic.\nSoft over the ear fit. Adjustable height.\nOne wire. Great sound.\nOnly drawback: They do not fold for easier storage."}
{"review":"The headphones are very nice and comfortable.  However,  the sound volume can't be turned up high enough.  I understand why they might want them toned down a little,  but this is just too much.  I was disappointed and I would recommend you find another brand.  They need to at least have the volume you get on an iTunes iPod."}
{"review":"Been wearing them for 30 minutes and they're starting to get somewhat uncomfortable(though still wearable). I'm pretty sure they just need to be broken in a bit.\n\nThey sound good and crisp.  Could use more bass, but you get $40 worth of bass.\n\nAmbient noise is definitely cut down a decent amount. Right now I can hear myself typing this review(muffled of course) with no music going...but with any music at all at about 85% volume on my iPhone, I hear nothing outside. I also tested it at 85% iPhone volume with youtube videos going in the background at full volume on my laptop and can't hear anything other than my music.\n\nBought these just for flights. After listening to them, I expect them to work very well.\n\nI got these for $40, so I'm happy. At $40, these are 5 stars, at $60, 4.\n\n-Adam"}
{"review":"I purchased these as a gift.  The recipient finds them to be very comfortable for long-term wear (throughout the entire workday), and has fairly good noise cancellation (better than a pair of \"noise cancelling\" earbuds by a mile).  At the price point I would definitely purchase these headphones again should the need arise for another pair."}
{"review":"I researched Amazon for a pair of headphones for my Final Cut Pro class.  My opinion of ear buds is low, since I listen to leakage on public transportation, the library, on the street...you name it. I don't care how small these ear buds are, if they leak, they're s***.  So, I wanted a studio-quality headset with serious performance I could appreciate, being somewhat of an audiophile.  And, off the subject a bit, why do men think they're the ONLY ones capable of discriminating what makes good sound??!  Anyway, when I plugged this set in, I was shocked at what these li'l babies were picking up:  background sound so clear I thought MY phone was ringing, clearly defined, crisp high, mid and low tones and - as far as I could tell - NO distortion.  This set can rival Bose and Sony at twice the price.  I couldn't be more pleased, especially since I wanted quality, but can't afford to drop $300.  These are far better than I expected.\n\nOne problem is the headset gets uncomfortable after long stints.  Problem solved by adjusting the length j-u-s-t so.  They do pinch a bit.  If you have big ears, you're probably screwed."}
{"review":"These are both my first over the ear headphones, and also my first closed headphones. Sound quality is much better than my previous Sony open on-ear cans. Everything sounds crisp and there's adequate bass for my favorite genres - dubstep, gabber, rap, etc.\n\nThe M30's fit my enormous head pretty well. I'd say my ears are average sized and the phones cover them perfectly. After about an hour of use though my ears start burning, which I guess is a side effect of closed over-ear cans. The long cable hasn't been a problem for me, I just used the included twisty tie to shorten it up.\n\nOne thing to note is that if you plan on using these headphones for a laptop, you may have to buy a USB sound card in order to power them properly or else you will get low volume and no bass. I personally use the Micro II, which is fine for the price.\n\nThese are certainly not the best looking headphones, and I'm sure there are technically better sounding options, but if you want something under $50 with clean, non-exaggerated sound, look no further."}
{"review":"I Just want to tell that for 69,99$ paid here in Canada at Long McQuade; its the best headphones you can find.\nNothing more, nothing less.\nGo ahead and buy it with confidence!"}
{"review":"I am no Audiophile,  but I do enjoy high quality music and I feel like I can tell the difference between cheap audio equipment and good systems.\n\nI wanted an over the ear phone because I felt like I was missing parts of the music with my little (but high quality) ear buds.  and I hate the pressure \"on-ear\" phones put on my head and ears.\n\nI did not want to spend more than $100, and i quickly found that you can easily spend much more than that.\n\nThese are great sound.  I can pick up parts of the music you just miss on cheaper systems, and even on a high quality stereo.  Having a closed phone help \"display\" the full spectrum of sound.\n\nBass is strong in a closed system, I always feel like people want too much bass - don't get me wrong I want an \"appropriate\" amount of bass, and these phones are well balanced.\n\nthere is no Active sound canceling in these - but unless you are trying to listen to music on a runway, or stadium - the passive sound canceling of having around the ear and closed phones - will be enough to forget there is a world outside these phones.\n\nonly con would be:\nyour ears get hot pretty quick.... I can last a few hours (plane ride, etc) but they get hot, and i feel like i need to let my ears breath..."}
{"review":"These are very durable pair of headphones with very nice sound, but very tough over the ears. Your ears will hurt after having them on for half an hour or more. Buy ath-m35 instead, they're same price range and much more comfortable."}
{"review":"Got these for $38.99 from Amazon a few days back during the Cyber Monday deals week. All I can say is that these are AMAZING for the price I paid. Far better than the Creative Fatal1ty and Skullcandy Agent headphones that I also own.\n\nPros:\n- Amazing sound quality. Very natural frequency range...no bass-boosting features (which IMO are terrible) that exist on headphones like Skullcandies and Beats. This makes it very suitable for all musical styles.\n- Solid build quality --> thick cabling and very well-protected cable ends\n- Very comfortable headpad and ear cups\n- Looks very professional\n\nCons:\n- Extremely long cord (11 feet).\n- Geared more for studio use than for outdoor use with your ipod\/phone\/etc."}
{"review":"these headphones are amazing, they look pro and cheap at the same time but i don't have to worry about that because they sound amazing, they are flat, they sound clean and you can use this for mixing or mastering a song. i recommend this, if i had a change to buy them again i would. the bass, treble and mids sound very cool."}
{"review":"I CONSTANTLY listen to music as I work about 18 hours a day and when I need to use headphones--and I have used a lot--these simply cannot be beaten. I had a pair of $169 Pioneer HDJ1000's and my dog ate the wire and I did not have a lot of cash and needed headphones quickly and thes are better than the pioneer. Buy them. You will be very happy"}
{"review":"Worth every cent. Trust me. Amazing. I can use it on my ipod AND on my guitar amp to play my guitar so the sound doesn't distract others. Great buy. Great quality. Very comfortable.\nDefinetley worth it."}
{"review":"UPDATED 09\/26\/2012\n\nPros:\nThe bottom line is that these headphones are very good. The sound quality is superb. Very clear and crisp sound with these. The bass leaves a bit to be desired. I run these through the HIFIMAN EXPRESS HM-101.\n\nCons:\nHere is where the but comes in. I do not recommend these for sound isolation if you have larger ears. They sat on my ears more so then around them and this caused them to be useless for sound isolation. Another issue that came of them sitting on my ears is that my ears began to hurt after using them for 1 hour or more.\n\nConclusion:\nThese would be a good 3.5-4 on my book if they weren't so uncomfortable. Saying that, my next shot at a nice set of headphones will be in the Sennheiser HD448. I tried the Sennheiser HD448 for a bit and had similar issues with comfort as the ATH-M30. I ended up with a set of Sennheiser HD598 headphones and love them, would highly recommend the HD598 if you are willing to spend the dough on them."}
{"review":"I have had a pair of these for 3 years now and they still deliver great sound.\n\nThey're also quite comfortable, even after hours of usage.\n\nHaving used them almost daily, I'm pleasantly surprised they are holding strong, with barely any signs of wear."}
{"review":"I bought these because somebody who posted on a forum for electronic drumming recommended these as an excellent sub-$100 headphone option. They weren't wrong. While I prefer my (much more expensive) Sennheisers overall, these are amazingly good for fifty bucks. Great definition, crisp, clear without harshness. Good sense of space. Nicely comfortable. Felt a little pressurized on the top of my head at first, but then began to stretch out and feel softer.\n\nReminds me of Sekonda's ad slogan: \"Beware of expensive imitations\"."}
{"review":"All I can say is WOW! These headphones are great for any use starting from listening to music or home studio recording headphones (as I use them). I really love the spring on the cable that is right before the 1\/8 or 1\/4 inch headphone jack. It really helps it not to get damaged at the most sensitive area or the headphone cable. I also love the length of the headphone cable. I can run it straight from my audio interface or computer to my drum kit (in which I record) without a hassle. The Headphones Barely leak and have a good sounding bass when I'm listening to music or playing back the recording. The headphones are all right at noise reducing but when you play something, even on the lowest of volumes, you can't hear a thing besides the sound being played back. The design is great and very comfortable, and not to mention very classy. Overall great headphones especially for the price. Definitely the best headphones for the price. Recommended for and use."}
{"review":"These have great sound and do cancel noise pretty well. They are not actual studio noise isolating. The bass and overall range is very impressive. The comfort level is very good. Long cord, which sucks for PC, but great for recording."}
{"review":"Purchased for use in a busy IT office with often loud conversations, these headphones deliver a great sound and background noise is kept at bay. I listen at a low volume so I can hear someone call my name or phone ring. The loud conversations still take place, but I am not bothered by them anymore, they are just a dull murmur in the background.\n\nThe headphones are comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time without any headache or heaviness.\n\nA fantastic set of headphones and a great value."}
{"review":"For the past year, I've been on a quest to find a decent pair of headphones for use with an iPad. I've gone through at least eight pairs of Senns, Grados, and JLabs, searching for a model that had decent design, construction, durability, and performance. My quest included both audiophile headphones as well as models designed primarily for the mobile market but not necessarily top performers for sound quality.\n\nI've ended up rejecting everything but the A-T headphones. Actually, the Senns usually self-destructed within six months although my pair of HD-555's lasted almost a year. The lower-end Grados looked and felt cheap in spite of their vaunted reputation. The JLabs J-4's couldn't reproduce bass frequencies well enough to support the psychoacoustic programming of meditation soundtracks.\n\nThe A-T's stand out as the best value overall. The Senns that cost three times as much can't come close to them. They are durable in two key respects for mobile use: the line cord is not so thin that it can break easily, and the headband construction is sound enough to resist damage when I rest my head on something. The cord also ends in a mini-jack plug designed with strain relief in mind. Which is a real blessing. And, unlike every other set I've tried, each side can be flipped so that the listener can monitor a soundtrack without putting the set in.\n\nI'm sure that extreme audiophiles would pick over the A-T's sound performance, but it's been accurate enough to support my own listening needs on a variety of music from classical to rock, and the bass is sufficiently tight rather than boomy while still correctly reproducing the low bass required for binaural beats. Reproduction seems at least as good as the 555's.\n\nThe one disadvantage that others might find is that the headphones cannot be tucked into a pocket or mobile case. I haven't found mobility to be a problem, but other might. And the A-T's ARE designed to be somewhat resistant to the elements with moisture-resistant ear pads, unlike many headphones designed for home use.\n\nThese are definitely headphones that I would buy again for myself and others."}
{"review":"I am not an expert musician or recording artist, but I love music and all of the nuances that go into producing a good track.  In my opinion it is all of the little background sounds that adds life to music.  These headphones let you hear all of those special tweaks - very clearly.  I usually use earbuds just for convenience to move around, but I recently went back to school, so I needed something a bit more comfortable that I could wear while studying for 2-4 hours at a time.  I did a lot of research and tried quiet a few different pairs in the under $50 range.  I am so glad I got these on sale because they sound better than all the regularly priced $40-60 pairs.  They provide a nice dynamic sound experience. My friend has a pair of Bose, and in my opinion, these sound just as good (Maybe I am biased).\n\nThe bass response is strong and tight, but it is not overwhelming.  If you require a big time bass response, these are probably not for you.  I know there are some brands\/models that advertise a lower frequency response.  Also, the top head strap is not super comfortable.  There is just enough pressure that it can bother me sometimes.  The ear pieces are quite comfortable, but of course they get warm like any other over ear phones would. The long cable is nice, but I have a tendency to sit for long periods of time, so I just coiled it up and put it aside.\n\nThese did take a few days of use to break in the drivers.  I put them on almost immediately and tried a few of my favorite songs, but the bass was a little muddled.  I was a bit worried, but I gave it a few more days.  I even let them run for a couple of hours with pink noise.  Now, after a couple of weeks, they sound great.\n\nOverall, very happy with with value and quality of this purchase."}
{"review":"I love these headphones! Now, I'm not like your audio junkies that get WAY into audio or anything, but I'm not a novice either. I took some sound production courses in college and everything, but I won't bore you with details to make myself sound smart... Plain and simple, these are fantastic for the price. I use these specifically to watch movies and play games after putting my kid to bed. I actually prefer watching shows this way now. My movies pop and explode the way they should, and my games give me cues that I never heard before.\n\nIf you thought that all your shows and movies had perfect sound, these are good enough that they may make the errors stand out because you can hear all the little details. I can now tell when a sound editor doesn't match his sounds perfectly and uses replacement dialogue instead of the original dialogue since one line sounds different than the next based on background sounds and white noise.\n\nSpeaking of white noise... I never hear any noise from the headphones directly. When my game or movie is paused, these are dead silent... just the way they should be. Crisp, bright, and even deep sounds will sparkle with these headphones. The extra long cord is awesome for lounging all over my couch, but I'm not sure I'd ever take these out of the home, they'd be too bulky for me in public and the cord would be a nuisance.\n\nIf you are looking for a cheap alternative to SUPER expensive headphones but don't want to go so cheap as to worry about your sound quality, look no further. I looked into headphones for a really long time and I am thrilled with these and use them often. I will definitely buy another pair if I ever wear these out!"}
{"review":"Beware of this product. Several reviewers have said that the wires or connections went bad after a few weeks or months. I like the sound on this headphone but after a month and a half of sparing and careful use the tip of the plug that goes into my computer's phone jack broke off. Not only is the headphone irreparably broken, now the tip of the plug is stuck in my computer, the sound does not work, and my techies at the university where I work tell me that I will have to change the motherboard if I want my sound back. I will get a partial refund on the headphones because \"the window for refund has elapsed\" but will Audio-Technica pay for a new motherboard for my computer?"}
{"review":"For a pair of over-the-ear headphones <$50, I've found the Audio-Technica ATH-M30 to be exceptional. Overall the unit seems to be very comfortable, well built, and has audio qualities that everyone can enjoy. I would highly recommend them for anyone looking for a solid pair of mid-range cans."}
{"review":"These headphones are HUGE. Very bulky and the style is more utilitarian than aesthetically pleasing. The real problem was they squeezed my head such that I started to get a headache 30 minutes in. I wear a large size hat, so maybe my head was too big? So I returned them.\n\nThose flaws aside, the sound quality was great and the headphones well-constructed. I could see them being quite durable in a professional environment where they get banged around a bit. If they hadn't squeezed my brain case so much, I would have gladly kept them, bulk and all."}
{"review":"I won't lie and say this is an unbiased review.  I now own two pair of headphones: the dorky koss portapros and now these audio-technica's.  The audio quality from the portapros were really good, but it was uncomfortable to wear.  The audio quality from the AT's are, in my opinion, better than the portapros and a bajillion times more comfortable than the portapros.\n\n All the people who reviewed the AT's as too tight must have ginormous heads...but you know what they say about ginormous head...ginormous hats.\n\n Anyways, I primarily listen to Rock, Rap, Electro House, and Dubstep.  What I like about these headphones are that the bass is not too overwhelming, but there is still bass.  There is a nice balance of everything.  Compared to my 6 year old iphone headphones, the AT's are way better.  They enhance the quality of the songs I listened to.\n\n I forgot to mention that I am an avid listener of audio notes from my college lectures.  It sounds like I am in my classroom.  This makes for great studying.\n\nBy the way I am just kidding about the style I used to write the review.  However I was honest about the review itself.  I understand the only way to get people to read your review is too be completely weir...unique.\n\nAll in all, these headphones are fantastic for audio notes from lecture, rock, rap, electro house, dubstep, and movies.  I am very happy with this purchase....AND GO GAUCHOS!!!"}
{"review":"Arrived well ahead of schedule, and they work fantastic. Far superior to the ones I had before. Overall; wonderful. They have a very comfortable fit, and I love the long cord."}
{"review":"i got these headphones after my $150 Bose suffered a broken lead.  I had taken such care of my Bose, but slipped one evening and they were GONE.  The very thin leads cannot be repaired (the wires are thin as a hair inside).  So, in disgust, I wanted heavy-duty phones.  These are over-the-top.  The wires look like industrial cables, and are very long.  The headphones are massive.  So, not at all suitable for use when walking about in public (I tried, with the wires all rolled up and in my pocket).  The jack itself must weigh as much as my iPod.  Sound quality is pretty blah, with a shrill sound to my ears.  I use them at home, but would not recommend them."}
{"review":"Couldn't be happier with these headphones. The audio quality is great. They're exceptionally comfortable. The cord is nice and long and seems to be heavy-duty. The price is reasonable. Highly recommended!"}
{"review":"To start I will talk about sound quality. For the less than 50 dollar price range, these are as good as it gets. Previous to these I have used Bose, Skullcandy, Sony, Sennheiser and Shure headphones. Each one of those pair had something the others lacked. I found that my Sennheiser Sonys and Shure headphones all had crystal clear highs and mids, yet the bass felt lacking and muddy at times in the Sonys. The Bose were quite frankly the biggest rip off they had a very muddy bass, and they highs left something to be desired. The skullcandys were very very bassy, best bass I've had in headphones, until these. These headphones aren't quite as crystal clear on the highs as they could be, but the bass has great presence without overpowering the other sounds, and the mids are phenomenal. I pick up fine acoustic bits I couldn't hear in other headphones, including some imprefections in recordings (nice to know musicians are prone to error).\n\nThe fit is also very good, the sit comfortably on the head, plenty of padding. I do, however wish there was a little more room for the ears, after hours with these on my ears feel like they have a little bit of pressure on them. Overall though, some of the more comfortable headphones I've owned. They have enough grip on your head, yet don't don't death grip like many sony headphones I've used do."}
{"review":"I've been using headphones professionally for many years and I'm constantly trying new ones to meet the needs of our recording and broadcast business. In our broadcast studio we regularly use the much more expensive Audio Technica ATH-M50. By accident I stumbled across this lower cost model and thought I'd try a set. I'm blown away, they sound fantastic and are even more comfortable than the more expensive model. I have headphones by Koss, Sennheiser, and AKG too but I'm ordering more of these ATH-M30 because of their comfort, excellent balanced frequency response and comfortable light weight."}
{"review":"I'm using this for my Yamaha CP50 digital piano, and wow, it delivers! It's crystal clear and gives a fuller sound than my expensive studio speakers. There's no static even when I use the full range of the piano or when I play extra loudly. Loving these headphones so far!"}
{"review":"this thing is light and comfortable. the sound is clear. distinctive.  i can hear different sections as different layers.  better than my $78 urbanear one...."}
{"review":"I play my electric piano with headphones on, so that it won't bother hubby while he watches TV. I use the over-the-ear style, my ears just don't like anything pressing on them.\nI gave my good Sony headphones to the son-in-law, and then my reserve headphone set blew out a speaker. I had one more reserve set of Koss that were totally unsuccessful in blocking extraneous noise. (Actually they almost modified extraneous sound instead of blocking it..go figure.)\nSo then began the hunt for a new decent headphone that blocked outside noise while providing good sound, something that looked like it would last, and didn't cost a fortune.\n\nEnter these headphones. They have a nice heft to them and don't feel cheap in the least. The earcups are similar to my good old Sony's, thick and meaty feeling.\nThe headphone sound is excellent. They do a good job of blocking outside sounds.\nThe fit is snug but not at all uncomfortable. They don't make my glasses hurt my head.\nThe cord is thick and looks like it should last a lifetime. The cord is too long, I had to bundle part of it up but other than that, I have no complaints and hopefully these will last a very long time.\n==========\nUpdate 12\/4\/2011: I always have problems hearing my TV when I\"m riding my Schwinn Air-Dyne bike. I used these headphones today. Wow, I couldn't even hear my bike. A little sweat around the earcups, but otherwise a totally wonderful experience to finally be able to watch AND HEAR my TV while exercising!"}
{"review":"While these are clearly quality headphones, they didn't fit my needs.  I wanted a pair to serve as everyday studying and lounging headphones as I worked on papers, listened to pandora, etc...  While they are easily the clearest and crisp headphones I've ever listened to...they sound flat and without depth.\n\nThough they would be great to listen to spoken word, perhaps in-studio work, and in other completely professional settings, the average song didn't have a dynamic feel.  I listen to everything from indie-acoustic to top40's rap, and though I heard a lot of detail in the songs that I previously not noticed, the lack of smooth bass or fullness of mid's made me decide to return them.\n\nYes they are light, yes they are comfortable, and yes they would have been without a doubt durable, but I know there are better and more full sounding headphones for around the $50 mark.\n\nAs one last side note, the cans seem almost seem a touch small to fit over and around the ears, but too big for the 'on the ears'.\n\nPerhaps I just was after a more 'standard' set of full, over the ear cans and I incorrectly assumed that a higher quality company\/model of studio phones would fill my need and more.  I'm by no means an audiophile, but I definitely believe you don't have to sacrifice a full spectrum of sound for perfect clarity."}
{"review":"This is, like most others have said, a great pair of headhones for $45. I really can't say anything someone else hasn't, but I will echo the point that the cord is very, very, very long and does have a nice flexible spring sheath to keep the cable from bending at 90 degrees and to keep you from pulling it out by the wire. Just don't expect to be able to carry this around without a few feet of cable wrapped around your person or concealed in a bag.\n\nThe other comment about the unexpected bass is also quite true. There seems to be a non-linear response at those frequencies, as the low-lows will jump right out at you and can make it sound like someone is beating on the wall or knocking into a box or other hollow object. The higher emphasis on the lower levels makes these perfect for face-melting DnB\/dubstep\/etc. drops but not so much for rock or tracks with more emphasis on highs.\n\nThat's not to say, though, that they drop out at vocal frequencies or anything; I've actually heard new elements in some of my music--some of which I wish weren't there, but that's not the headphones' fault. ;) If you so desire, the high bass can of course be combatted with an equalizer with some minor tweaking, but don't go crazy with a software EQ; this is the first pair I've owned where messing with Foobar's EQ actually made it sound worse, though I might try again after I get used to them\/after any \"burn-in\" period, if these suffer from that."}
{"review":"After researching different types of headphones, my decision had come down to three headphones that best fit the criteria I had established. I was looking for a product with exceptional sound quality, very soft cushions around the ear, strong enough for every day use, and within a reasonable price range.\nThe choice had to be made between he Audio Technica ATH-M50's, the Seinnheiser HD-280 Pro's, and the Audio Technica ATH-M30's. One of my friends had purchased the ATH-M50's and he said that they worked well, however, they were very tight around his head and occasionally gave him headaches while he was listening to music. Except for the tightness, the headphones were very functional, had great sound quality, were very secure and durable, and had a convenient spring rolled wire that let him roam around as he was enjoying music.\n The Seinnheiser HD-280 Pro's were quite pricy, starting at one hundred dollars. Similar to the ATH-M50's, reviewers of this product also complained of them being very tight. Users also had to completely extend the head phones so that they would fit over their heads. The plastic headband was also inconvenient because it consistently cracked. The headphones, however, has a few notable features, one of which is the great sound quality. The noise-cancelling feature allows one to actually listen to their music. The headphones also have a big, soft cushion, which comforts your ear.\n When it came down to choosing the one, the Audio-Technica ATH-M30 headphones were the ones I chose. The product's many great qualities heavily outweigh the few cons. The sound quality, durability, and comfort of these headphones were it's great features. Considering the forty-dollar price tag, this item was a great deal. Whether you are a professional DJ or you just love listening to music, I would recommend these to anyone. The best features of these headphones, I believe, are the supported headphone jack and the extremely soft cushion around your ears. The wire on these headphones is thick and the headphone jack is encased in metal and supported by a metal spring, which prevents any tears or breaks in the wire. Overall, these headphones are amazing, especially for the price they are listed for."}
{"review":"I have had a lot of pairs of headphones and these are not the best, but they are by far the best value. I needed something that sounded good, wouldn't break the bank and wouldn't bleed sound to the rest of the office. These fit the bill perfectly."}
{"review":"I have never owned a set of true headphones before. I never could have imagined using headphones on a daily basis for something like TV listening, but I reached the point where I wanted to experience better sound quality. I had a stereo hooked up to my TV, but it never became my standard way of watching TV, as it consumes too much power, is too noisy, and is another annoying step I must perform every time I want to watch TV. In short, I never bothered to really use it. I considered surround sound or even a sound bar, but that would be hard to set up in my bedroom and is expensive. I didn't think there were any other good alternatives besides the above options.\n\nHowever, being a gamer, I have heard of gaming headsets like the Turtle Beach Ear Force and how much they improve the audio experience. I was all set to drop $60 on the Ear Force PX21, but then I decided I wanted to see what my alternatives were and see if there were ones with better or on-par sound quality and a cheaper price. Fast forward quite a few hours later, and I'm more confused than when I started. Headphone prices range anywhere from $20 to $200, and all of the good ones say the same thing, no matter what the price. $20 headphones can say \"amazing sound quality\", while $200 headphones say \"so much better quality than $20 headphones\". How much better can better be than amazing? I didn't know, so I decided to try low-mid end, starting with the Audio Technica M30s. If they didn't suit me, I could return them and buy more expensive headphones. I will not be returning my headphones, luckily.\n\nIf my scenario sound somewhat like yours, then I fully recommend these headphones. Below I'll include a pros\/cons list.\n\nPros:\n-Extremely comfortable. I have used these for up to 3 hour sessions and the headphones never caused any discomfort. I also wear glasses and have long hair. I can't feel my glasses and the headphones don't tug on my hair if it's over my ears. My hair does make my ears itch sometimes though.\n-Simple yet sleek design. Some headphones just look silly. These look great.\n-Long 11' cord. I watch on a 32\" TV about 6 feet away, so you could probably watch up to a 42\" TV without needing an extension cord.\n-Great sound quality. I'm not an audiophile, and I don't know if there is actually a difference between these and something like some Sennheiser 595s or if it's all in your head. I don't have a single complaint about the sound quality, though.\n-Great price. I got these for $44, and that doesn't seem to be a sale price, although Amazon lists MSRP over $100. These come just a bit more expensive than no-name entry level headphones.\n\nCons:\n-Can't adjust the volume. This is not a problem for the product's intended use, but for those that want to use this for TV viewing, it's something I worried about. However, the standard volume level (at least for my TV, don't know if it would differ) was great, although maybe a bit too loud in games, which are usually adjustable anyway. If it's too low for you, you'll need to buy an amplifier for around $10-20. If it's too loud, you can buy a volume controller for $5\n-No RCA cables. Again, not a problem for the product's intended use, just mentioning it to help others. You'll need to purchase a 3.5mm female to RCA male adapter if your TV does not have the proper stereo output like mine. This purchase is a paltry $1.50 and free shipping, though. Just order before your headphones arrive.\n-Head size. I have a slightly small head for an adult I suppose. I use these headphones on their smallest size and it fits just about right, if not a tad too large. I'm not sure if they came smaller if smaller would be TOO tight, but for kids and teens, these headphones may be a bit too loose. If they're not in the perfect position and I tilt my head back to take a drink, the headphones will slip back.\n-No microphone. Not really a con as these are headphones and not a headset, but since they do the same thing and I'm using it for gaming, I'll go ahead and mention it. If you need a headset, it is easily fixable by getting a Zalman clip-on microphone for $12. If you want to use it with your PS3 or 360 though, you'll need to buy even more conversion cables.\n\nIf the cons bother you and you're pretty sure you'll end up needing all of the other accessories I mentioned, you may want to consider a true gaming headset like the Ear Force PX21, which is a higher price, but pretty much has an amplifier, volume controller, and PC\/PS3\/360 microphone built-in and I believe has RCA cables. I can't comment if sound quality will be worse, and very likely won't be better, so if you think you can keep it simple, the ATH-M30s are a much better buy."}
{"review":"You can ONLY hear crisp treble, deep smooth bass, and an amazing range of all levels. It WILL NEVER CRACKLE or hurt your eyes by being too loud. They are built to ALWAYS sound perfect. I'm trippin right now, just got mine, listening to my favorite hip hop and it's sounding so amazing. Not as loud as other headphones, but that's because these don't sacrifice qualify, and thus know when to set a volume limit. I appreciate it, my ears used to hurt with other headphones, these prevent that from happening.\nNow, the physical phones. WHAAAT!! So legit! I literally am holding them next to a pair of $50 Skullcandy Hesh headphones, and the quality winner is obviously Audio-Technica. The padding quality, the metal for the extensions, the engerering how they open up, and the confort, like nothing is there! Hardly notice them! I f-ing love these! Now, the one potential issue for some is that the cord is like 10' long. I forsee this as being very helpful in certain music-jamming situations. For those who are just on the computer or in the gym, you have extra cord to hold in your pocket. Big woop, the cord is SUPER nice, thick, and has metal springs at the end to protect it from being pulled or bent. It's shiny silver, and comes with a larger adapter (like to plug into a guitar or a keyboard). Packaging was even awesome, and easy to open for once! Oh man, sooo good, soo happy with my purchase. Skullcandy's are great headphones, I just never realized the bass crackle or loss at certain levels, until I heard perfection from these, and once going back to skullcandy, I can tell the difference big time. Skulls get louder, Audio-Technica's always sound perfect, and get 90% as loud as Skullcandy. Holla. GET THESE. I researched for over 5 hours one night about ALL BRANDS and I even bought and returned a few competitively priced sets. These are the winner, you will be a happy camper unwrapping these pups... and for $40 with free shipping are you serious!? Awesome! Thank you Amazon and Audio-Technica, this is the most I've written since college."}

{"review":"I'm not an audiophile. I assume those folks should be shopping in the $150+ range. For me, I compared the sounds from these to old JVC headphones, a pair of sony headphones, and my klipsch S4 earbuds.\n\nI found deeper bass and higher treble on these headphones. Of those I sampled, I was pleased with these the most.\n\nIf they are reliable\/durable, they will be well worth the money."}
{"review":"These are good headphones for the money. Audio quality is very good, and I am happy with the sound quality. These are not really comfortable with glasses on. The headphones are a little heavy, and the cord is long and heavy. Definitely not a portable pair of headphones. I am using them to listen to music at home, so this is not a problem for me. If you are looking for headphones to carry with you opt for something else.\n\nI would recommend these headphones as a sturdy pair for home use."}
{"review":"Just got these today and I'm blown away. They block out just enough noise, but not so much that you would miss a fire alarm going off. The bass response is better than I've ever heard from headphones. Have worn them for 3 hours now, and my ears are comfy still. If I had three thumbs, I give these three thumbs up. Buy these now."}
{"review":"Okay, my better half ordered these headphones to review audio recordings for our business. I borrowed them one day to listen to my MP3 player while I cleaning the house. The Audio was clear and crisp. On a side note, I had little noise when I ran the vacuum cleaner and the audio was perfect.\n\nPS. the cord is extra long."}
{"review":"These headphones have amazing clear sound from the deepest bass to the highest treble and everywhere in between. The cable is thick and seems quite rugged, it is also quite long without being absurdly too long. The mini stereo to 1\/4 inch stereo adapter it comes with actually screws on to the tip to prevent accidental disconnection and to provide additional stability. Once it is attached it is as rock solid as any headphones that only have a 1\/4 inch jack.\n\nThey cover the entire ear providing amazing isolation from any noise in the surrounding environment. I can work on my music even while my wife watches television right next time me. They cup tightly to the head, but not so tight that they squeeze and cause discomfort."}
{"review":"Let me start by saying that my entire life is based around music. I've played professionally for various singers\/bands and am currently running a studio out of my home. I always look for the best quality of sound above all else. I have a pair of the Audio-Technica ATH-M50's for mixing.. and they are so well designed\/attenuated that when looking for a cheaper pair of headphones for non-studio use (chores, sleeping, gym, etc.) I knew I had to stick with The ATH-M series. I picked up the M30's from amazon (based on everyone's reviews) and the sound quality is superb. They produce a very warm tone, lots of mid range with a nice low end punch and treble roll off. The vocal tracks are never too crystal clear\/shiny like some headphones (which annoys me) and the low end does not interrupt the other frequencies.\n\nMy only complaint (and reason for knocking 1 star) is that they are extremely tight on my head. I have an average sized head (or so I think) and wearing them for more than 10 minutes it starts to feel like someone is squeezing the sides of my head.. sort of gives me a head ache. I think they were designed that way for more sound isolation.. but it is really uncomfortable. I'm going to start looking into ways to stretch them a bit because I really do love the sound they put out!\n\nAnyone else notice how tight they are?"}
{"review":"The bass is strong enough for me. The sound quality is great. There's no need to spend over $200 to buy the DR. Dre stuff.\nBut please note that the cable is really really long. If you plan on carrying this around, it might not be so convenient."}
{"review":"These headphones are great if you want something cheap and portable.  They absolutely cannot compete with higher quality headphones from companies like Sennheiser and the like.  I primarily use these headphones for listening to Pandora at work, but at home on my hobby computer where I do most of my audio work, the Sennheiser HD 280 Pros and Sennheiser HD 555s beat them handily in every performance metric.  The most noticeable problem with these headphones for me is that they do not seem to clearly output sound in the mid to mid-low range.  Though I have not investigated the audio drivers, it seems as though they are tuned for most of their performance in the highs to the mids and then in order to push them as a performance model, some fair low end bass performance was tacked on later.  Sounds that shift from mid to low are drowned out and sometimes bass comes at you unexpectedly since it seems to be driven a bit more powerfully.\n\nIf you are looking for the best sound, don't buy these.  If you want a set of headphones that you can use everyday that sound way better than a set of earbuds get these.\n\nI don't want anyone to think that these headphones are not good.  They are *absolutely great* for a price of $45 and they will be worth it to you if you do not want to purchase a higher end model or if you are listening to low quality mp3s.  I would recommend them to anyone that wants to be able to actually hear their music and can't\/doesn't want to buy a higher end set.  I rated them a 4 out of 5 due to the low price and more than acceptable sound."}
{"review":"I was at first pleased with these headphones. The sound for the money really is pretty great.\nHowever, after under 3 months use, the connection is breaking. I'm a 52 yo woman, and do use them almost daily, but I'm really quite gentle and careful with them. There's been no pulling or other rough treatment of them, honestly.\n\nThe wire at the connection to my PC (the only use they get) is loose and I have to play with it to get the left ear to work. It seems to be getting worse each day, with shorting at the right ear, too.\nMy husband will tape them up for a temporary fix, but it shouldn't have to be. I'm quite disappointed with them.\n\nPerhaps it is something I've done, although I really cannot think what. Or maybe it's simply a faulty pair. Bottom line...it's too late to do anything about it other than chalk it up to experience and try a different set.\n\nJust wanted to let you all know. Hope you have better luck than I did.  :)\n\nupdate 4\/21\/2012\nMy original review was for one star, as they broke so quickly. However...\nMy daughter's brilliant husband fixed them for me, and I have to say I really love them. I'd still be careful, and be mindful (as I was NOT) that there is a 1 year warrantee. But as far as sound for price, I can't imagine you could find much better. I bought a cheaper set for interim use, and although I think they were about half the price, they weren't worth it. Get these. They really are great!"}
{"review":"I got this set of headphones for my son as a birthday gift. They arrived on time and my son is very pleased with the fit and sound quality. He would recommend to others"}
{"review":"Bought primarily for music listening on my computer with an Asus headphone amplifier card, and on my family room high end music system.  Sound is very good on both systems, from low to high volumes.  Individual sounds are very clear and crisp (no muddiness), with excellent directional imaging.\n\nNot expecting much, I plugged these into my Android phone to listen to MP3s while spending long waits in my doctor's office.  What a surprise!!!  They actually sounded pretty good, with plenty of volume from that little phone.  Sure, I could hear the weaknesses of MP3s vs. CDs or LPs, but my earbuds are now trash.\n\nI found the bass a little strong, requiring a little treble boost for a balance that best suits my aging ears.  Some reviews talk of improvement after break-in.  I had never thought of headphones needing break-in, but maybe the treble will get stronger after a few more hours of use.  If not, a little tweaking of the treble is an easy solution.\n\nBuild quality seems excellent.  I can't find country of origin on package or phones, but quality is better than I expect from China.  Maybe these still come from Japan?\n\nComfort is good, not too heavy to wear for long periods.  Fit is a bit tight, but they don't flop around on my head as I move.  On that trade-off, I prefer no flop.\n\nA COUPLE WEEKS LATER: Treble has improved with use, and is now nicely balanced with bass.  I guess headphones really do need a break-in.  Increasing rating to 5 stars."}
{"review":"Simply put, the best headphones I have ever owned. I've used them with a portable turntable, CD player and iPod. Amazing sound quality and noise cancellation. There's too much cord to take them on a walk, but for my musician partner and my music-loving self, these are perfect."}
{"review":"I bought these after reading reviews and shopping for a set of mid-priced, flat-response headphones that I could carry with me (to avoid damaging my more expensive ones which I keep at home). I teach audio production and was also looking for a set that I could recommend to students that are on a budget. These work well for the price, seem to be accurate (at least, moving from mixing in a DAW to near-field monitors) and cut out a reasonable amount of room noise. I wouldn't mix with these in an environment that was too noisy, as they aren't very loud and although they function well (as closed-back) they just aren't as isolating as more expensive headphones. Reasonably good and reliable so far."}
{"review":"Never heard better sounding headphones at this price range.  In fact, sounds better than a lot of more expensive headphones I've heard.  Big fan of these!"}
{"review":"The piece you insert into the Ipod or other music device bent really easily. I do not even know what I did. One day they were just bent. The headphones still work."}
{"review":"These Headphones are great for studio monitoring situations.. singers, drummers, or any performer who wants to hear the mix very clearly and with great level.\nthey are very confortable when using and fits your ears perfectly.\nyou have to know that they are not flat in their frequency response, they are a little bit colored on low frequencys but thats good for bass players monitoring or drummers monitoring.\nif you are looking for headphones to give to your musicians .. they are an excellent choice at a very low price.. great quality and Audio Technica engineers behind them.\nif u need a mixing headphone, try a better ones .. such a  AKG K240 Studio or a highest Audio Technica ones."}
{"review":"Well I own and use earbuds for the most part, not the expensive kind just a decent pair.  I wanted over the ear headphones because I wanted great sound with great bass.  They turned out not as I expected and I prefer my earbuds to these headphones.  They're not too bad but there is no bass and the sound isn't as I had hoped."}
{"review":"If you have 40-60 bucks to spend on headphones, get these. I just got them a couple weeks ago and they're impressive. The cord is ridiculously long and it's not the most bass I've heard in headphones but it still \"bumps\". If you're using these with an iPod be sure to go to your playback settings and set the eq on something like Rock or Loudness. It makes a world of difference. These were a major step up from my $20 Sony standard monitor headphones. (UPDATE) I realize the fact that these headphones lack so much bass, I've asked for Beats by Dre studio hd headphones for Christmas. I hear the bass rocks on those. These are great for an overall sound. About a 3 of 5 rating for bass, that's with the \"rock\" setting on your iPod too. Kinda weak without that added EQ booster."}
{"review":"I am going to keep this short and sweet.  I bought these for my husband who is really into good sounding music.  High end and Low end and what ever is  in the middle he is really happy with them. I did a good job, he is very picky."}
{"review":"These headphones are so amazing, especially with games. Deep rich bass, and crystal clear engrossing sound. Really great deal at $38. Very durable design as well.(eargasm)"}
{"review":"I had a pair of cheap sennheiser's that broke, and I'm glad I made the switch. The sound is much clearer on these, I enjoy them alot. It was definitely worth the price. I'm not a headphone buff, but if you're looking for good headphones for casual use, then definitely consider buying these."}
{"review":"they all of a sudden stopped working on me after like one month. the sound quality on them was amazing but all the sudden stopped working and now i cant get my full refund because it is passed the return date. Good headphones when they work. Buy at your own risk"}
{"review":"I wanted a set of headphones that would provide great sound quality and durability while still meeting a strict budget. These were it.  They are one of the best sets for under $50.\n\nThe ears are enclosed and very comfortable as is the head band.  The cord is long enough to permit me to even watch television.\n\nThe 1\/4\" adapter for the 1\/8\" cord is beneficial as well."}
{"review":"I've had them for a few years now and they haven't broken. They have great sound quality and are very cheap. I highly recommend them."}
{"review":"First let me say that for the money the headphones are excellent.  They do require a headphone amp to sound better.  Let me explain: amps i.e. mp3 players, phones etc. all derive power (sound) depending on the load. The load equals speakers or headphones.  Load = ohms. These headphones are a higher ohm than most.  This means your player does not see a \"heavy\" load.  Thus the amp provides less although cleaner power.  So it requires more volume to play loud.  If you are looking for very loud headphones this is not for you.  Try Ultimate ears 5 or similar.\n\nThe best speakers or headphones will allow you to hear the sound of different drums\/mids. If you can hear the drummer hit different drums as Different sounds in your speakers\/hphones then this is a good sign. Most speakers will sound clear but play \"all\" drum sounds as one sound from the hphone. Great speakers will also allow you to hear symbols or high at the same time.\n\nThese headphones are very accurate for the price point!  Very!  I have sold top of the line tube headphones costing thousands. These do not compare to them :) but for $40 bucks are very good.\n\nCons:\nThey are uncomfortable, too tight. Your ears will hurt after 30 minutes or so.  This is not a good thing.  Good sound does not help if your head hurts.  I hope with time they will strech out a little.  I have a very thin head and they are tight."}
{"review":"I'm not an audiophile, so I'll defer to those reviews for anyone looking for a sound quality assessment.  But I did live with these phones for over a year, and the only way they let me down was the way the outer liner of the ear cushions fell apart all at once; the cup cushion material has a film on it which peeled away in big swaths, and made me feel less great about the phones in general.  If I hadn't left them in a hotel room I'd probably still be using them, but in shopping for new 'phones I'm hesitant to get another Audio Technica set due to this one issue.  I'd appreciate hearing others' experiences."}
{"review":"It's impressive, It's totally worth it ... The sound is really good and it's comfortable... really good for music and video games (I use em on my PC.)"}
{"review":"I purchased these headphones looking for a great pair for my iPod. My first impression when I took them out of the box was that they look decent and hoped they were. I tried them on and I didn't like them at first but after a day or two they felt better but not as nice as I had hoped.\n\nPros:\nThe cord is very long and its thick\nThere is a lot of bass (if you like it)\nIt comes with an adapter\n\nCons:\nAlthough it fit my head good, it wasn't tight enough so if I moved they would slide around (that was a big negative for me)\n\nOverall I am disappointed in them. I hope to return them"}
{"review":"The first thing I noticed when I put these headphones on was how clearly they delivered the music. I tested them out with some jazz (\"So What,\" Miles Davis) and it sounded absolutely fantastic. The highs and mids, I would say, are excellent. The bass, however, is somewhat lacking: You definitely hear it, but it's not rumbling by any means. Then again, in this price range, and considering the overall quality of the sound, it's no reason to pass them up unless the driving, thumping bass is the most important thing you look for in a set of headphones.\n\nAs for comfort, it's just there: I wear them consistently for a few hours at a time and, other than having to pull the phones away from my ears for a second to relieve the pressure, I don't have to adjust them. Everything is padded well. I also did a sound leak test on these by turning the volume up as high as I could stand (about 90 percent) and my roommate told me she couldn't hear a thing coming from them. I'd call that a passing grade.\n\nI also really like the spring these phones have around the wire where it meets the input jack. It helps resist the normal wear and tear (and, in my experience, just straight-up tear) around there that happens there over time."}
{"review":"Now we're talking...or listening.  These are great headphones with crystal clear reproduction.  So good that I bought two, and have not looked back on the purchase.  I'd buy this again."}
{"review":"I have been an audio-sound-freak for many years and have and have had some of the top of the line sound equipment in both theater and portable kinds.  Sound-wise  and weight wise, these ear phones can't be beat. The price is right as well, although that was not my primary motivation.  The research I did by reading various reviews on this and other sites brought me to try these.  You won't be disappointed if you are looking for real sound-enhancing phones.\n  The only \"downside\" is that they are not  the best at filtering outside noises, but are not bad.  Don't buy these if that is  your main objective."}
{"review":"The cord was much longer than expected, and at first iw as dissapointed to see the plug in was not a small 3.5mm which is the standard for head phones but when you turn the cable a little bit it screws off the attachment which is perfect. Sounds amazing, a tad haeavy but these are noise cancelling ovber the ear headphones so its nothing you would expect."}
{"review":"This is first pair of record company quality headphones and I am so pleased with them. I can hear so much more, with clarity, and my enjoyment of my favorite tunes has reached even new heights. I haven't tried any other products, but for the price, it is definitely worth it!"}
{"review":"There is so much value on these headphones. I use them for listening to an array of music, from rock to hip hop. The bass is a little weak when I'm playing rap beats but overall the sound is phenomenal. I also plug these into my keyboard so I can hear purely the piano sound. The headphones cover my ears entirely and the cushions are very comfortable. I can wear them for hours and not feel stressed.\n\nGreat buy!"}
{"review":"I was looking for a solution to my `large' head. I had gotten some Sony headphones and found them very uncomfortable. I searched online music production forums for suggestions on some proper headphones that would fit any size head and the Audio-Technica ATH-M30's were mentioned. I am highly satisfied them. Not only do they fit-they go above and beyond. They're amazing! Very comfortable, amazing sound and build quality. For the price-they're a real deal."}
{"review":"I bought these headphones about a year ago after a pair of good-sounding, cheaply built panasonic headphones fell apart. I was definitely impressed out of the box. The bass response was impressively rich and clear. It was after several days of use that i realized the real quality. I heard things with these headphones that I'd never heard in songs that I'd listed to through a myriad of sound producing mediums. Unfortunately about a week ago I realized that I must have blown them out. I now receive crackling instead of bass. The highs and mids still remain quite good and for that reason i will hang on to them instead of scrapping them altogether. Take note that i seem to do this with a lot of mid-quality headphones, despite the fact i do not use them at excessive volumes. I did use them during a bit of amateur recording which may have been the culprit... Regardless more than satisfactory while they lasted, not so much afterward."}
{"review":"I've been using these headphones for years. They sound amazing. Accurate sound, nice bass response. Really really comfortable. I record with these as my monitor headphones. Not sure if I would mix with them, but I'm not a mix engineer. But as a singer who has to wear these for hours on end, they never disappoint.  I also use them for personal use, walking around with my iPod, they just provide excellent sound. Only downside is after years of wear, the fabric starts to come off the headphones a little, sometimes leaving pieces behind on your ear. Not a big deal, but after 5 years, I decided to buy a new pair for this reason. But for the price, buying a new pair after 5 years is a really damn good deal."}
{"review":"I got a pair of these phones only thinking about the soud quality and comfort. The quality and comfort of these phones get a 10 from me. Keep in mind that these are meant for home stereos or recording, hence the 11 foot cord. If you try  to use the with an ipod or mp3 player it normally may not be loud enough, but you can always get a headphone amplifier."}
{"review":"There are so many positive reviews of these headphones, yet I have to add mine also, as these deserve it.  I can't imagine anyone getting these home, trying them out on their favorite music and not being quite impressed.  The cord and plug are high quality, and I've used them quite regularly for the last several months and found them very comfortable.  The sound quality and ability to reproduce the highs and very lows are very impressive also, even moreso at such a reasonable price."}
{"review":"I got these headphones because at work I am allowed to listen to music, and so I wanted to get something that would be comfortable for 8 hours a day and sound good.  The headphones don't entirely cover my ears, but they are still very comfortable.  As for the audio quality I was impressed.  I have $50 speakers on my computer but I find these headphones sound WAY better.  For the quality I don't think you can find a better price."}
{"review":"Excellent product for the money.  Very high quality sound.  Others have complained about discomfort after long use, but I have not had this problem.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a \"good buy\"."}
{"review":"these are a decent pair of headphones, although they are not as clear as my Sony Studio Monitor Headphones, they are a close second.  It picks up great low end and has a clear high end but not as crisp as Sony."}
{"review":"Very nice sound. Keeps out the noise while I'm studying in the same room as my wife watching TV, two yappy dogs and various neighborhood sounds. All that I needed and at a very reasonable price."}
{"review":"I use these headphones for pc gaming.  I have a small head (being female) and these fit me just right at the smallest setting.  They're quite comfortable - I can wear them for hours, no problem."}
{"review":"The sound quality is very crisp and clear, they also does a good job and blocking out noise. They are also comfortable to wear. The cable to connect the headphones is very long and therefore will give you a lot of space. Overall for the price it is a great buy and works really well with instruments and amplifiers."}
{"review":"I have a pair of Sennheiser HD 595 and my daughter liked them and wanted a nice set of head phones for her iPod.  I didn't want to spend that kind of money on a product that might get beat up or lost.  These Audio-Technica's sound great on an iPod and you can't beat the price.  If they get lost of broken I can get into another pair with very little cost downside."}
{"review":"I currently own three sets of headphones: the recently released KRK KNS-8400's, the Sennheiser HD280's, and the ATH-M30's. Here's my comparison of all three:\n\nThe KRK's are not loud at all, but they don't color the sound at all, making them the most accurate for mixing, which is what they are advertised to do. The 280's are the loudest of the three,and have the best isolation, but can get uncomfortable pretty quickly. The M-30's are the most comfortable for my ears, and although they do color the sound, they are the most pleasant to listen to overall, in my opinion.\n\nTherefore, i use the KRK's for mixing, the 280's for recording vocals, and the M-30's for general listening. If i had to pick one to buy, i would probably pick the M-30's, oddly enough, the least expensive. Go figure."}
{"review":"Really nice headphones. I can hear just about everything very clearly. Nice long chord for your studio. I like the fact that there is a sort of spring around the cord coming from the headphone jack to support it from bending too much and shorting. I was hoping for a slight bit more bass but it's definitely not bad. Maybe it's just because they probably have no built in equalizer presets which is a good thing for recording."}
{"review":"I worked with these for a few hours doing video transcription.  I'm 5'11 and may have a bigger head, but my ears are probably average-sized for my height. I found that they weren't uncomfortable or tight on my head, though the ear pads do sit on the edges of my ear, rather than encompassing my ear.\n\nThe closed-ear design helps greatly reduce outside noise (passive noise isolation). This makes them good for working in a louder environment (noisy office, not ground control at an airport), but with most circumaural headphones they can't be easily stowed for travel.  I travel (mostly via plane) a decent amount and for them to stay easily accessible, you will most likely need to keep them around your neck.\n\nI recently tried out cans in higher price points ($99-$350). I went with&nbsp;&nbsp;for a hundred bucks because of the sound quality and fit.  For headphones in the same price point as these ATH-M30's, I'd go to a Sam Ash or Guitar Center and try the&nbsp;. I have not done an A-B test on these with the M30's though, so it's just a recommendation for comparison based on what I know about Shure as a brand.\n\nBack to the ATH-M30's I like the bass and the highs. I listened to&nbsp;&nbsp;(Rock),&nbsp;&nbsp;(Classical with electric instruments), and&nbsp;&nbsp;(Classical with traditional instruments).  If you're a bass freak, this won't blow you away, but if you simply like bass as part of a greater piece these will produce good beats.  (For example, I have two 10\" subs in my car, but I love bass as a piece of the whole--not just bass by itself.)\n\nFinally, I definitely wouldn't call these \"professional headphones\" as I think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone in the pro audio industry using $50 headphones for 10 hour days, but if you're looking to get away from ear buds or $10 headphones from the drugstore, these will certainly be an improvement.\n\nPro:\nPrice\nSufficient highs and lows\nNoise isolating\nNo \"Y\"-style cord\n\nCon:\nDon't sound as \"full\" as the Shure 440's (though the M30's are half the price)\nInexpensive materials\n\nFYI:\nNot too heavy, but larger than other styles of headphones\nMay not surround your entire ear\nLong cord"}
{"review":"I bought one pair of these headphones for use when podcasting and loved them so much that I bought a second pair. I use them for over an hour each time and they're comfortable enough to keep on the entire time."}
{"review":"These are superior headphones for the low price.  I bought them for my eight year old to use with her ipod touch and dvd player in the car.  Great sound and they fit her little head well."}
{"review":"I purchased these headphones expecting to get my money's worth, and I was quite satisfied. Yes, the bass can be a bit lacking at times (though that seems to be more dependent on the song itself, as many tracks show the phones' bass to be quite rich and deep), but the overall balance and quality of the sound is quite nice. No, you're not going to get the upper echelon of quality like you'll find in upper-end Bose and above, but they're a nice set for all but the most discerning audiophiles. I see a lot of negative comments about the sound isolation, but I honestly don't have a problem with it myself. They're not noise-canceling, so you pretty much get what you'd expect. Honestly, these have the best isolation of any non-NC phones I've had.\n\nThe band, while very sturdy, can be a bit uncomfortable at times, and the leather can make the phones quite warm after extended use (over an hour or so). However, I have a rather large head, and with a simple adjustment, I was able to find a perfect fit. It tends to sit hard on the top of the head, but a little adjusting should do the trick.\n\nOne of my favorite features of these headphones is that the wire goes in one side and loops around the headband to the other, rather than splitting off to each one. While being a seemingly subtle difference, the result is not having to carefully \"work around\" the wire(s) every time you remove\/adjust them. This is especially useful for smoking (as there's never any wire(s) directly in front of you to get burned) and coats\/jackets, and also severely reduces the dreaded \"tangle\" that often afflicts headphones (doubly so for those with such a long cord).\n\nAside from a few very minor drawbacks (the aforementioned slight comfort issue, as well as the ridiculously long cord), I honestly can't find any real complaints here. The sound is great (the best you're likely to get without spending several hundred dollars, anyway), the unit itself is incredibly sturdy and seems to very durable, and once you \"get the hang of it\", it's quite comfortable. If you're looking for a $50-$150 range headphones, it's hard to beat this one. Believe me, I've tried a lot in this range, and the only one possibly better is a $140 pair of Bose over-the-ear headphones; and even then, they're about identical."}
{"review":"I'm not an audiophile, I just wanted some nice comfortable headphones for sharing via headphone amplifier for music, computer stuff, and electric instruments. These phones sound great, isolate the outside quite well, are good (not great) build quality, and they are comfortable to wear for 2-3 hours at a time. I quite like the screw on 1\/8\" to 1\/4\" adaptor. I also have the ATH-M50, the M50 is a better headphone, but not by much. If you are on a budget you won't go wrong with the M30's! At 50 bucks they are a bargain."}
{"review":"First of all, I'm no audio expert, but I do listen to a load of music and play lots of games and watch lots of movies. I know when a pair of headphones is something special, and these...are...SPECIAL!\n\nThe first thing that struck me is how rich the sounds are, and how clear. The bass is so deep that you'll feel your head is vibrating, and not in a painful way--in a very good way! And yet the treble is crisp and all the stuff in between is perfectly clear...I'm hearing things in my music I've never heard before.\n\nThey're also comfortable. People seem to complain that they can't be worn for extended periods but I've had no issues--I guess it depends on your head. They fit very cozily on mine and the isolation is far better than the headset I used before (Razer Charcarias). I can't hear anything going on around me when I listen to music, and even when nothing is playing I can hardly hear anything beyond them.\n\nIn all for 50 dollars here on Amazon you'll be getting amazing headphones that truly bring audio to life. I do not regret this purchase for a SECOND -- well worth every penny!"}
{"review":"For under $50, you really can't do better than this. I recently decided to upgrade to the HD-280s and, upon their arrival, I thought the ATH-M30s sounded remarkably better. These probably won't satisfy you if you're an extreme audiophile, but, if you're looking at this page, that probably doesn't even concern you."}
{"review":"I received these headphones as a gift a few weeks ago and they have been nothing short of fabulous for me.  I travel a lot and they make flying very enjoyable.  These headphones are extremely comfortable and I've worn them for 13hours straight without discomfort.  Compared to the Dr. Dre headphones, the bass on these isn't even comparable, the Dre's are much better.  But these are still an extremely good pair of headphones.  Given the price, comfort and sound, these are definitely a bang for your buck!"}
{"review":"This is the first product I've ever been compelled to write a review for. I just recieved these headphones in the mail yesterday and I have to say, I love them.\n\nThe sound quality is simply amazing. I'm hearing things that I never knew were there in songs. The bass is strong but not overpowering. I've listened to music, movies, and played a video game with these and the sound has been amazing for all of them. I've never owned a pair of nice headphones before, I've always been more of an earbud type. These might have changed my mind though. The noise-cancelling is very nice as well and I like how you can adjust the headphones for your head. The headphones are amazingly comfortable. The cord is very long which is great for me as I can lie in my bed listening to music while they are plugged into my computer across the room.\n\nI'd highly reccommend these to anyone looking into new headphones. They are relatively cheap compared to other top options yet they give you excellent quality. Great bang for your buck!"}
{"review":"I'm not an audio expert. With that said I think these headphones sound pretty good for the price. I honestly don't find anything wrong with sound. This is not something overly bass heavy so if that's what you're looking for don't get this. The guy who said he was looking for headphones that sounded great, not just great for the price, should really have thought just a little harder about his choice to get sub-$50 headphones. These do sound better than your average \"no-name ear-buds.\" Trust me, I was stuck with no-name ear-buds for quite a while. Isolation isn't amazing, but is still a large improvement over conventional ear-buds. When I ride my bus I still hear the engine and such, and only until the music is about louder than I normally like it is when I can't hear people. Comfort is a slight problem. The foam muffs don't rest on my ear necessarily, and they don't really go around it either. However, they're not unbearable and I can wear for about an hour or so, take a short rest, and put them on again. The way this thing is made seems like it will last and doesn't look like cheap plastic. The cord is nice and thick and looks like it can stand a bit of damage. At the price this thing is, if you want a good, cheap alternative to say, iPod headphones, get this. The value is amazing.\nOverall 4\/5\nSound 5\/5\nIsolation 3\/5\nComfort 4\/5\nValue 5\/5"}
{"review":"These headphones were horrible. When they came out of the packaging, the connecting wire was already flawed. Sound only played from one side, or the other, depending on how you twisted the jack. I never could get both sides to play at once. The comfort was very bad, made my ears hurt, and was scratchy.\n\nFor the price, these were a rip-off. I would have sent them back, but I ended up ripping them apart because after a gaming session where I could not hear anything and I simply lost it. Nobody should suffer these on their head."}
{"review":"These are my thoughts after about 24-hours of use.\n\nComfort:\nThese headphones were extremely uncomfortable for me (my hat size is 7 1\/8\"). I usually don't get headaches, but these managed to give me a headache after 20 minutes, without fail, every time I put them on. Maybe it's circumaural headphones in general for me because even Sony's MDR V150 were infinitely more comfortable (which are universally hated by audiophiles). Instead I bought Beyerdynamic's DT 235 (http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/beyerdynamic-DT-235-Headphone-White\/dp\/B001BAKTFO) which are not circumaural, but my ears are small enough so that they basically are.\n\nSound:\nI'm no audiophile, but the sound quality was excellent to me; even without an amp.\n\nCraftsmanship:\nFairly well built, it is made of plastic. The biggest cause of concern for me was the thin cord, but the connector was covered in a metal spring contraption, which made it seem very solid."}
{"review":"The sound quality on these headphones is pretty good, but the driver is not very strong.  The volume has to be turned up pretty high on any device I use with these headphones.\n\nI bought them almost exclusively because of their claims to high sound isolation, and expected to be comparing them to my Etymotic Isolator in-ear phones.  The reality is that, isolation-wise, they barely beat out my cheapo, no-name, non-isolating, over-the-ear headphones.  I can hear a clock tick a room away when wearing these things, for crying out loud.  In short, they filter out practically no noise at all.\n\nI didn't find the pressure uncomfortable, as others have, but I also wouldn't call them comfortable either.  The pressure is definitely there, as evidenced by how hard the ear cups clack together if I'm not careful when taking them off--hard enough that I fear damage will ensue if it happens enough times.\n\nOn the other end of the cable, despite a long metal sheath, a metal spring protector, and thick insulation, after thirty-two days of regular use the wire for the left headphone broke at the plug end, so that I had to hold the wire in just the right position to get any sound.  Less than twenty-four hours later, the wire for the right headphone broke as well.\n\nThe final kicker is the price dropped on these by $9.13 in the month since I bought them.\n\nIn all, these have been the most disappointing purchase I've made of any kind in a very long time.  I would not recommend them to anyone.\n\nPros:\n- Decent sound quality\n- Plenty of cable\n\nCons:\n- Poor isolation, despite strong claims to the contrary\n- Tension is so high that if not careful when removing them, the ear cups come together so hard that it will probably lead to damage before long\n- Despite two forms of cable protection at the plug end, the wires for both speakers broke after thirty-two days of regular use"}
{"review":"I really like these headphones. I use them connected to my 12 channel mixwe. I am a muscian who practices at home a lot. Problem is home is a twinplex. So I input everything to my mixer and when my neighbors are home I use these headphones. They sound great. No problems in reproducing my vocals and several different guitars and amps. A great purchase a resonable price!"}
{"review":"I tried three different headphones:\n\nSennheiser 280 Pro\nSound was very good, especially after some burn-in. But VERY uncomfortable. Way to tight -- really clamp down hard on your head. This produces great isolation, and they're well built, but this is useless if you can't wear them. Note: I don't have a big head.\n\nAudio Technica ath-m30\nThe sound on these was just okay, and they sit on the ear (not around the ear), so they don't isolate well at all. They are more comfortable than the 280s and much lighter, but they also feel a little weird (being on the ear), and I don't know why anyone would buy closed headphones that don't isolate.\n\nShure SRH440\nI think these sound the best. Maybe not quite as clear as the Senns, but they are more dynamic. They feel less like the sound is in a tin can. The sound feels closer. They are very well made. Probably the best made of the bunch. And they are comfortable. Not as tight as the Senns and isolate almost as well, certainly well enough."}
{"review":"I've had these for about a month now.\n\nI'm not any kind of audiophile, I just needed some decent headphones to block out distractions in our noisy office environment.  They work well and are comfortable enough to wear all day.  I only have a couple extremely minor niggles to note:\n\n1) The cable is really, really long.  Since my head is never more than three feet from my computer, this means the bulk of the cable just gets in the way.\n2) They make my ears a little warm.  Nothing bad, it's not sticky or nasty, just the the earmuff style keeps my ears completely covered all the time.\n3) Some days, I'm constantly being interrupted, so I'm forever taking these headphones off and putting them back on.  These don't slip on and off easily, and the fact that the ear cups rotate around 180 degrees can cause me to have to fumble with them a bit sometimes to get them back on.  This is more an annoyance with my co-workers than these headphones, but it's worth noting that it's an issue if you plan to pull them off a lot.\n\nThe quality seems good-- again, I'll leave the analysis of sound quality to others who have a more discerning ear-- but I'm pleased with the purchase."}
{"review":"These headphones sound relatively \"flat.\" They're not the greatest for listening to MP3s, unless they're really well mixed and high quality. That's not to say that there's anything wrong with them, just that there are better choices if what you want is tons of bass or high treble or whatever. What these headphones are great for is use as monitors. They're awesome for recording audio for video, due to their clear reproduction of speech. They also work quite well as general-purpose PC headphones, great for movies, videos, and games."}
{"review":"I bought these headphones about 2-3 months ago. They have been fantastic for when I travel (usually from Arizona to New York or Boston, so long trips), and also everyday use. The only little downside is that they do get slightly uncomfortable after you use them for an extended period of time... say over an hour. But, once you give your ears a few minutes to breath, you can put the headphones back on for another hour or so. Another downside is that the cord is absurdly long. It doesn't really bother me, but I can see how it would annoy some people. and when I say long I mean around ten feet long."}
{"review":"If you are looking for some decent headphones for a decent price, look no further. I've been looking around for some good headphones, even thought about putting down a whopping $300 or so for the Bose or Dr. Dre headphones, but then came back down to earth and realized im not rich, and you don't need a high price to get a good item. These are not the greatest headphones in the world, but they are well worth this price. Whether it be you just wanna listen to music (like me) or you are recording or whatever, i would recommend you give these a try."}
{"review":"I bought these headphones after reading many other reviews. But I think I was misguided by them. The sound quality is not so high, and they are not that comfortable. If the other reviewers had had to pay double the price, would their reviews still be as good as they are? Probably not. I was looking for quality sound, period. Not quality sound in relation to the pricetag. I compared the sound against my other much simpler and cheaper headphones, and there was hardly a difference.\n\nThe lack of quality in this item is simply forgiven by the other reviewers because they were not that demanding, because they hadn't paid much for it. Oh, and the headphones are hardly sound isolating."}
{"review":"For the money (I purchased mine on sale from Amazon for under $50.00), these headphones are wonderful.  Crisp highs and substantial bass.  I have no idea where they rank in the world of \"studio monitor\" headphones, but for listening to MP3s when you want the comfort and solitude of a over-the-ear phone, they are pretty dang satisfactory."}
{"review":"Pros: Great sound, Comfortable fit, Durable Design, Long cable, comes with the 1\/4inch adapter, reversible cup for convenient studio work. I love em!\n\nCons: These are big. They're not really created or designed for travel, or packing up. They don't fold up.\n\nThey are studio monitor headphones, so as long that's what you want them for and use them for I KNOW you'll be pleased with the whole experience when using these headphones.\n\nFor the price, these headphones are fantastic. I've had no problems with them. I use them for my in-home studio work and they are perfect for that."}

{"review":"This is not an expert review, but is meant for those who like decent headphones to listen to mp3's, etc. that will maximize so-so equipment without costing hundreds. I ordered this to replace a Koss HQ1 vibration stereophone (battery-powered bass enhancement) and wondered if I'd suffer a fall-off in bass, but the ATH-M30 is even better! The sound is crisp, clear and the volume is more powerful than the Koss - I've had to turn my volume\/equalizer settings down.\n\nOn WinAmp I can hear much more clearly than before what happens when I adjust the equalizer. If I pick the preselectable \"headphones\" preset, which trims back the midrange volume around 600 Hz and gradually ramps it back up to around 16 KHz, and then kick up the base end, it almost makes my ears vibrate.\n\nI tried it out on mostly string music (Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusic), piano music (Chopin's Revolutionary Etude), listened to the clear high frequencies in Bach's Violin Concerto #2 in E Major, and then the real test: Linda Ronstadt's \"Silver Threads and Golden Needles,\" where the clear and distinct drums, bass, steel guitar, fiddle, and voice left me finding no fault with these headphones.\n\nOf course, it's not the same as \"live\" (I play in classical piano in adult music recitals), but it comes close enough for me.\n\nAdditionally, I like the design and construction. The curved part that fits over the top of head is the only spring needed to force each headphone to seat itself in the proper position - as opposed to other headphones that have a spring inside a hinge that can break or weaken. The plug - a 1\/8\" stereo plug that comes with a screw-on 1\/4\" stereo plug - has a strain-relief spring over the last inch of line to prevent kinking and breakage.\n\nOthers have complained the headphones fit a little tight. That is true, although the cups fit over my ears so it doesn't bother me and actually leaves me free to move around without worrying about it falling off - the cord's a nice 11 feet long.\n\nI ordered this a week ago for $39.21 and see it's now $48.84 but I guess it's still a sale considering it's $119 list price! If an unexpected problem arises in the future, I'll edit this review."}
{"review":"I'm not an audiophile, but I think these are pretty great headphones; certainly the best I've ever owned.  The sound quality is great, and they are comfortable.  I do wish there was a little more bass, but it's still has a good bass response.\nThe 11 foot cord is a blessing and a curse depending on your application.  When I'm at my computer, playing games, or listening to movies through them it's really nice. But, when I'm walking with my mp3 player it's a bit annoying.\nI would recommend these to anyone who wants good quality sound without spending a small fortune."}
{"review":"For the price, these are pretty amazing headphones.  My husband owns some personally, which he uses for simple audio editing and listening to music at the house.  Our church also owns a pair for the sound booth in the auditorium.  Our church has a full band (drums, guitars, keyboards, vocals, etc.), and the headphones really help isolate the sound for the tech.\n\n- Comfortable (no headaches)\n- Structure is durable and hardy\n- Adjustable for different size heads\n- Good sound quality and dynamic range\n- Effective at blocking out external noise (okay, so they're not Bose, but they're pretty dang good!)\n\nONLY CON\nWear and tear on the ear pads - the vinyl fabric covering the ear pads starts cracking and crumbling eventually (takes 2-3 years depending on how much you use them).  The bonus is that you can purchase the replacement ear pads for just a few dollars from Full Compass online.\n\nObviously, you can get much better headphones by paying lots more money, which some people need to do because of their usage needs.  However, for this price range, I haven't found anything better.  If they ever break, we'll be replacing them with the identical pair - they are that good."}
{"review":"I've had my hands on a lot of headsets, and this is by far one of the nicest I've put on my head. I like the closed-ear phones, and they are studio quality.\n\nThey're EXTREMELY comfortable, and the sound range is fantastic!  Picked them up on an Amazon special and boy, what a bargain!\n\nIf you want a set of phones with a clean, rich sound, you can't go wrong with these.  They have incredibly clear lows and crisp, clean highs.\n\nI would buy another set of these without even thinking about it."}
{"review":"These headphones are the real deal!!  I am not a die hard musician but these sound great. I can also wear them all day.  The sound they produce has made me question why i have only been using earbuds my whole life.  Comfortable, great sound, good bass and treble -- and i also wear them with no music playin as a sound muffler. I would def reccomend these if you are looking for a good pair of headphones that won't break the bank.\n\nI use them at work on my desktop.  If you were to use them as your normal everyday ipod\/mp3 player headphones they would be great just bulky.\n\nI love the long long cord as well!!  It is a great set of music blaring headphones.!!"}
{"review":"I had a Sennheiser HD202 that lasted a few years before they started sounding bad, so I got the ATH-M30.\nOk they are not bad but nothing to get excited over. The fit is acceptable, the cord is too long, they external sounds good, but the main problem is they are not loud enough. Also there seems to be a little missing in the sound quality department, bass is not deep enough to hear the hit of the drum or explosion in a game.\nI am no sound technician so I will not try to use big words to describe the highs and lows of these headphones, but like I said they are decent.\nOverall satisfied enough to keep them because it's not worth what I would have to go through to get a replacement."}
{"review":"I ordered these when the Fender headphones that came with my bass guitar broke. I really liked the good sound and bass of the Fenders, but they had no padding on the top, so I was hoping to find something with both.\nThese headphones sound really good. The sound is very clear and the bass is great for headphones. The cord is long (which is good for the reach but bad for the annoyance the rest of the time). The plug is very nice. It's big, but that means it's sturdy good quality. There's a spring on the cable coming out of it to keep the cable from bending too far and breaking wires inside, and the connector actually screws into the 1\/4\" adapter to keep it from coming out.\nThey go all the way over your ears and are very comfortable. They feel a bit bulky, but for headphones this size, that's a given, and the comfort is what counts.\nI bought these for a car trip. In the car (or other similar places, I guess), the bass is much less noticeable. They block out a lot of sound from the outside, but it still affects the sound quality. I tried using the equalizer on my iPod to make it better, but it made only a little difference. You'd probably need noise cancelling headphones to really perform in that environment. Other than that, the quality was still great.\nAlso, on a lesser note, the packaging was really nice. Very easy to open, no tools needed."}
{"review":"I'm not a headphone aficianado, or some uber musician type, I'm simply a guy who sometimes wants to listen to some music, or play a video game, or just read and listen to a score while doing it. So, take that into consideration for this review. My old headphones were a pair of noise cancelling Sony something or others, that were great for the time I had them, though were flimsy and I swore I'd buy something new next time around. Cue to about a month ago when a friend of mine had a pair of headphones he uses DJ-ing, and I thought they looked solid, so I tried them on. He told me he just bought them last week, and they were on sale at Guitar Center for like $60. I gave them a twirl, checked them in my computer, and decided then and there, I was going to buy these. I was even more stoked when I got on Amazon and found them for like $38 bucks! But, that was where I went wrong.\n\nDecided I could get the same for $38, or the next step up (the ATHM40FS) for only $15 more, I got the M40s. And it was only one day after owning them that I realized how crappy the M40s are. They're poorly made, a sloppy design, and you need to buy a jack adapter. Essentially all the things I did not want in a set of headphones. So, I returned them (mine also had a blown speaker in one ear) and turned around and bought the ATH-M30s. And one month later, I'm even more impressed with these then when I got them. They're as comfortable as can be, the sound is amazing, and flat out they get the job done!\n\nIf you're looking for something solid that will last years, these are a great buy."}
{"review":"I'll keep mine brief.  I like these headphones.  They have a nice dynamic range range response in all frequency areas.  I listen with them on for over an hour at a time routinely, and they never get uncomfortable.  And this price is way better than anyone else.  Guitar Center could not match this price, they told me if they did they would be losing money."}
{"review":"I'm going to fall into the category of folks who use headphones to drown-out office and airplane noise.  If your looking for an audiophile-like treatment of these headphones then I'm too simple a user to provide that.  So far I have used them on 12 hour flights and they are as comfortable as you can get in my view.  I tried the Sony noise canceling headphones which are in the same $50 range and these are more comfortable than them and just as quiet.  I'm not one to spend $200 on headphones so I don't know how they compare against $200+ headphones since it just doesn't matter to me.  The ear pad cushions are really soft and comfortable and so is the cushion on the top.  That top cushion really does feel nice when you are wearing them for long periods.  I typically have the headphones plugged into a laptop or my miniature 2nd Gen iPod Shuffle and they sound great.  In the office environment these headphone really do a good job blocking out the annoying ringtones of the coworkers who can't figure out how to put their phone into silent mode and the loud phone conversations between loud people.  You know who you are.\nI had a set of Sennheiser HD 201 Headphones which I really liked and thought they were great but once I put these on the difference was obvious.  These headphones do cost twice as much but I have to say they are worth the extra.  Very clear and precise when listening to Pink Floyd, Pearl Jam, VH, etc.  Not sure about music which requires a heavy bass sound since I don't generally listen to it.  Classical music also sounds great in these headphones. The cord on these headphones comes out of only one side which is very nice and the plug end has a spring on it which acts as a strain relief.  The plug is also robust which was the downfall of the Sennheiser headphones since I bent that plug and when you bend a plug on a $25 pair of headphones they become landfill material.  If you are questioning the extra cost of these headphones then don't and pull the trigger.  You will not be disappointed in them."}
{"review":"I've had these for 3 years and use them almost every day.  Working perfectly so far.  I'm not rich so i don't have many hundreds of dollars to spend on speakers, headphones, acoustic paneling, etc.  but to my ear these things sound fantastic.  I mostly listen to classical and lots of speakers and headphones short the midrange which is vitally important for this kind of music if not for movies, games or rap.  This is best sound I've ever had at home.  I don't see how anyone could go wrong with these ESPECIALLY for the price."}
{"review":"For what you pay for these they are very well made. The sound is crisp and clear. They look and feel very sturdy. Yeah, you can get better ones but, for those of us who are in a budget these are great. I use mine with my electronic drum set and they work perfectly. Good deal!"}
{"review":"Well I was hoping professional headphones meant that I was going to get the best experience with listening to music, playing games, and watching movies.  I was wrong.  These headphones make my music sound boring and makes everything sound soooo distant and quiet.  Turning up the volume makes it feel loud but STILL distant.  I realize I really hate wearing headphones after buying these, so I'm going back to earphones.\n\nIf you want to enjoy your music, look elsewhere.  I would suggest Sennheiser as I went back to them and haven't looked back."}
{"review":"These headphones are absolutely outstanding.  Ignore any of the earlier ho-hum reviews, I don't know what these people were thinking.  Maybe they are comparing them to ultra high end units which are 10X the price, in which case why would you bother writing a review comparing apples to oranges??\nAnyway, I am an audiophile with a fairly high end amp, tuner, speakers, etc.... but have always been disappointed with my headphones.  I've tried quite a few over the years, mostly earbuds and other in-ear types (sennheiser etc...) but have had mixed results.  Mostly, I don't like the way earbuds and in-ear headphones 'feel'.  Maybe my ears are a weird shape, but either they don't fit right or they get uncomfortable after a short time.  On the other hand, the closed back home stereo type phones I've sampled did not work great with my ipod; the ipod just did not put out enough power to really drive em'.  The ath-m30 phones are the perfect compromise.  They sound great, and my ipod (at about 60 to 75% volume) drives them just fine.\n\nThese things are a steal.  Both my wife and my 6 year old daughter absolutely love them so I'm probably going to have to pick up a second pair."}
{"review":"I had this headphone for only 3weeks now and it's the best headphones I've used in a long time in terms of comfort, quality and construction. The earpads are large and comfortable for long use, the headband is made of metal with a soft cushion on it which proves to be durable and takes a long time to wear. I also like the fact that it delivers the right amount of bass not too much to be uncomfortable and not too little to keep u amping up the bass on your EQ. I compared it to a set of Beats by Dr Dre Earplugs and this won hands down. I love it so far no complaints.....Also great for mixing recordings"}
{"review":"decent set of cans for the money. my first real set of head phones in many years. crisp clear sound, comfortable and affordable. i'm quite pleased with my purchase."}
{"review":"I've had these headphones for about 4 years now, I guess. They've served their purpose well. Originally I got them for recording and mixing, but started using them more and more for just listening to my iPod over the SkullCandy in ear monitors I was using (except when I needed the portability of the IEM's). None of the SkullCandy offerings can compete with these.\n\n-The sound quality is excellent, especially after a little burn in (i.e. play time, to loosen up the moving parts). Bass, Mids, Highs...They're all there with good separation.\n\n-Construction quality: Although they feel a little cheap, as you would expect from 50 dollar cans, they have held up quite well overall after 4 years of use, including my kids getting a hold of them a few times.\n\n-The only real issue I've had is the fake leather covering over the foam ear pads has peeled off over time and is now completely gone. That's why I gave them 4 stars. This does not affect sound quality per se, however it has made the dampening from the outside world less effective. Again, mine are 4 years old, so this issue may have been addressed by Audio-Technica by this point (or not, I don't know)\n\nI've upgraded to the ATH-M50's, which are in a completely different class, but I still think the M30's are an excellent choice for the price. If you're looking for a great set of headphones that will allow you to hear your music like you haven't before, without spending 3 figures, these are the cans for you."}
{"review":"I have just started using these headphones and two things stand out.\n\n1) The sound quality is far better than my old set (Panasonic RP-HT355).  Deeper base and a crisper overall sound that was obvious immediately after swapping.\n\n2) The fit of the ear muffs is not the best.  There should be a little more padding so the speakers don't press against my ears.  This becomes slightly bothersome after about an hour of wear.\n\nOverall, these are great headphones and I'm glad I have them (got them for Christmas).  They are a good value at the current price of $46.58."}
{"review":"I was looking for a good pair of on ear headphones and I decided to go with the M30's based on my previous experiences with the brand and customer reviews.\n\nI used the headphones for less than 24 hours. I wasn't impressed with the sound quality but it was decent overall, for $44 why complain? I listened to many different generes of music even watched a movie on my laptop. They started to feel uncomfortable after having them on for an hour or so, not unbearable but definitely uncomfortable. Then I started to notice that the right ear was cutting in and out, I figured it mightve been the audio jack from the device I was listening to. I tried it on several different devices and it was still cutting in and out. Probably recieved a defective unit, but it was enough for me to return them.\n\nIf you're looking for a decent pair of on ear headphones for seldom use, go for it. Other than that, I don't recommend these."}
{"review":"i cant use any techincal terms as i am not a serious audiophile, but i am a serious gamer. i use them onboard an aircraft carrier during my off time, and since i cant connect to Xbox Live, i don't need a mic. these are PERFECT. i can crank my games and movies without bothering anybody, but i can still hear anything serious (alarms, announcements, etc.) so they are a great blend of sound blocking and still able to be aware of surroundings. i have never dropped over $30 on cans before (previously had a pair of sony cans for that price and they sound cheap now), so i am glad i plunked down some extra green for these.\n\nas for comfort, i have worn them for about 5 hours non-stop while playing xbox and they feel fine. i have rather normal sized ears and they fit perfect. sometimes they do feel a bit constrictive around the tops of my ears but i think i just need to adjust the band to take some weight off. speaking of the band, its perfect also. i wear a 7 1\/4 hat and these don't pinch my very normal sized noggin at all. i've heard of nightmares where people can only wear thier cans for a couple hours before thier band feels like a vise. imagine my relief when i discovered these are barely noticable.\n\nsound quality is top-notch. amazingly deep base without sacrificing much, if any high frequency detail. not muddy or tinny, just right while sounding rich and crisp. i almost prefer them to playing while listening to speakers! seriously, these are the best headphones i have ever owned."}
{"review":"I guess my ears are a little big, but I wasn't able to enjoy the sennheiser hd 202 series. So I got these.\n\nThey fit over my ears so snuggly and comfortably, I can wear them for hours and hours and it doesn't hurt my ears at all, feels very good. They also bonus as earmuffs in the cold. The sound isolation is pretty great as well (though nothing near professional earmuffs). Plus, the sound quality is quite clear. Obviously not as good as a much more expensive pair of audiophile headphones, but for the price of the ath-m30s, you get some great sound. The bass gives a really nice punch.\n\nAlso the build quality is superb. Very solid feel to them. The headphone jack has a serious weight to it. Very pleasant.\n\nTotally recommended"}
{"review":"I have been involved in home studio recording for over 4 years now and I am very impressed with these headphones. I can't imagine how anyone could not be considering the price. I previously used a pair of Sony headphones that were in the same price range and they were crap compared to these. Funny because I never really gave audio technica the time of day."}
{"review":"I had more than one experience with this headphone before buying.\nSo I was sure of what I was buying ...\nI was looking for a very comfortable with a good audio quality and that's exactly what I got.\nI recommend."}
{"review":"I got these head phones as a gift after having done much research. I have yet to come across headphones that offer more bang for the buck. At a price like Amazon's, you could do no better than this set.\n\nIf you prefer a coiled cable, go for the ATH-PRO5V's, but otherwise, I think they're the same model."}
{"review":"I have not had a single problem with these.  Sound quality is great, range is great, and the build quality is great.  They're also very comfortable.  I wear them consistently for four to five hours at a time without problems.  I can't imagine a better set of closed-back headphones for the price."}
{"review":"I will gladly admit that I am no where close to a sound professional of any sort, but I do know good sound when I hear it.  These are fantastic.\n\nThe detail is wonderful, as is the range.  They beautifully render everything from Alasdair Fraser's intricate violin, to Jim Brickman's smooth piano, to Bach's grand \"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor\", to the huge drums that accompany Mairead Nesbitt's \"The Butterfly\" (which, by the way, nothing else I have can really do), to several different types of vocals, to...well you get the point.  These are monitoring headphones which means that the bass is not enhanced, but it is accurate.  So if you like massive bass, you should probably adjust the EQ of whatever you are using, or pick a different pair.  They do a good job at passive isolating (not active noise isolation, just to be clear) from external noise, so you had better sit close to the phone.\n\nThe construction seems solid, but time will tell for sure.  I've worn them for about 6 hours a day for the last couple of days, and have found them quite comfortable.  Lighter than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise.  They are warm, but not excessively so.  If you wear eyeglasses, circumaural headphones like these might press on the ear pieces some which can get a bit bothering.  The jack end of the cord is built like a tank, and even has a metal spring on the first inch or so coming out of the jack to further toughen it.  The cord is, as the specs say, really long.  Great if you are plugging into the back of a computer or moving around.\n\nOverall analysis:  great sound for the price (truth be told though, I haven't used anything more expensive), well built, and very comfortable.  Now click \"add to cart\"!\n\nEdit:  I am still very happy with these several months later.  They are holding up great, though I am careful with my stuff.  One thing I have noticed is that the pan seems to be slightly left.  This may be because that is the side with the cord.  Generally it isn't a big deal, and it is not even that dramatic.  But if you are creating a mix that must be really precise, take it into consideration."}
{"review":"Great pair of headphones, amazing sound quality, no leak and comfortable. The price is so low as well for them, i've listened to other Audio Technica headphones that cost more than these, and these have better sound quality. As for no sound leak, i cannot hear anyone outside of the headphones so if you want to listen to your music without distraction\nchoose these."}
{"review":"I bought the ATH-M30 headphones about 8 months ago as a replacement for an old pair of Sony's.  I don't use them for professional use, only for listening to music and watching movies and tv shows on my computer.  For this use, they are absolutely perfect.  They provide great sound quality, very little outside noise (not enough to bug you but enough to grab your attention if someone is calling you) and fit very snugly on the head.  I highly recommend these headphones."}
{"review":"These are AMAZING headphones for the price. I have a set that's $70, $30, and $20, and this one blows all of them out of the water. The only problem has been mentioned before - they're uncomfortable if you wear them for a long time. It's really not that bad for how great they sound, though."}
{"review":"These headphones did not meet my expectations. Sound was muffled and seemed distant (like you wanted to turn it up, but couldn't),plus they weren't loud enough to really enjoy 80's metal and\/or symphonic rock. They were comfortable on the ears and had excellent noise cancellation properties."}
{"review":"I've head these headphone for about three or months, I haven't looked back on my purchase.\n\nI listen to a lot of electronic music, these headphones makes ambience more smooth and relaxing, it also has powerful bass. For those people who are complaining that the bass isn't boomy enough, you can easily produce the boomy bass by adjusting a few equalizer settings in your media player.\n\nThe product is well designed, it doesn't have cheap wiring which is a huge plus. It'll probably last a lot longer than my other headphones.\n\nIf you're on a budget and you want to experience high quality sound, get these cans!"}
{"review":"Very good headphones - simple as that.\n\nI'm not an enthusiast or professional and I'm using those for listening of my mp3 player and computer gaming."}
{"review":"THE DOG BARKS IN THE DISTANCE, THE PLANES BUZZ OVERHEAD,THE GUNFIRE IS ON ALL SIDES AND THE LOVERS MAKE LOVERS SOUNDS AND YOU HEAR IT ALL WITH THESE HEADPHONES. A POWERFUL, COMFORTABLE UNIT AT A MORE COMFORTABLE PRICE...."}
{"review":"After shopping around, I settled on the ATH-M30 due to its price and apparent quality.  The phones allow me to listen to my record player while moving around my room due to the 11' cable. The phones provide extraordinarily clear, balanced sound.  There is no bass boost, seeing as these are studio phones, but the sound is still gorgeous. I recommend these to any vinyl lover or music lover in general who wants crisp, clear sound at an affordable price."}
{"review":"I'm a medical transcriptionist who works at home. I was looking for some noise-cancelling\/reducing headphones to cut out some of the noise in the house when I'm working. These fit the bill! They are great headphones for my work...and less than 50 bucks AND free shipping! Wonderful."}
{"review":"Great sounding headphones.  One complaint is the ear pads are very thin and extended use irritates my ear. Also they don't seal out noise very well.  The Sony v6's are more comfortable and more efficient power wise."}
{"review":"I own this headphones and two microphones by audio technica and I love the quality they deliver with every product. This headphones are amazing and have been used by me for 3 years no in my home recording studio and also when I'm chilling with my ipod\n\nThe sound quality is very good and could be compare easily with headphones costing twice as much so why pay more?\nThey are very comfortable, rugged, the cord is long and you don't need an adaptor  that amazon recommends to switch from 6.3mm (1\/4) to 3.5mm (mini) this headphones comes already with an adaptor just unscrew the plug and you will see.\n\nIf My M30`s would get lost or broken tomorrow I would buy another pair immediately."}
{"review":"Sound quality is great, headphones are really very comfortable.\nI use them to watch movies on my laptop, my husband uses them for playing games on the computer and we are both very satisfied. Headphones rest very comfy on your head and lay tightly around your ears, making it easy to wear them for a long period of time. Good noise reducers too."}
{"review":"I'm very happy with these headphones, shipment was prompt and the headphones are well made, comfortable and the sound quality is Greeeeat!  I use these in my home recording studio to monitor and master recordings, I can hear every little detail.  They're much better than the other 4 sets I own and the price is definitely right.  Highly reccomend these!!!"}
{"review":"These phones have exceeded my expectations. Very comfortable. Bass is not boomy like other closed phones in price range. Excellent mid range and treble. Needs about 150 hrs of burn in."}
{"review":"Great sound but not quite as comfortable as I had hoped they would be, after about 2 hours I start experiencing some discomfort, but to be honest this may be do in part because of the fact that I wear glasses."}
{"review":"The sound quality was great for the price. I do not know if this is particular to me but ear hurt after listening to an hour or so."}
{"review":"As a musician who likes to shop on a budget, I've experimented with many different types of headphones and these by far are the best bang for your buck.\n\nI use one set in the studio (for over two years and still going strong) and another set for casual listening in the office. Nice isolation and comfort make these a must have if you don't like spending over $100 for head gear."}
{"review":"My first impressions.\n\nThe sound quality is really good, I have listened a few different genres (classical, rock, live concert), they all sounded really well. And, it still hasn't burned in yet, so, I am expecting even better performance later on.\n\nThe bads (resulting in a star loss). The design. It is not collapsible (unline Sony's MDR-V6 model), if you try to collapse it, you may break it, so be careful. Secondly, it is more like supra-aural rather than circumaural, hence, it doesn't isolate from the outside very well. I think it is worse than MDR-V6 in that aspect. But, I feel it sounds better than MDR-V6."}
{"review":"These headphones are the best bargain that u can get for a low price. The sound quality is excellent(which you can always expect from audio technica) and are also very comfortable..they are not at all flimsy( i have dumped them ino my bags during air travel but still u cannot find a scratch on them). The only poblem that i faced is the long cable which makes it quite messy at times..but considering the pros these headphones are a must buy!!!"}
{"review":"I'm an art student who is either working in my studio which is unfortunately close to a woodshop or working on videos.  For the first situation, these headphones do a phenomenal job at masking the sound of the woodshop.  For the latter situation, I have been able to up the quality of the sound in my videos with these bad boys.  They handle bass supremely while also keeping the high freqs clear.  In addition to the great sound, they are comfortable, lightweight, and have this awesome durable cord.  My dad is a recording artist and I told him about these.  He decided to order a pair and ended up replacing his $200 dollar headphones with them.  At this price I would recommend these headphones to anyone."}
{"review":"I'm not any kind of expert, but I bought these to wear on a trip to Europe to discourage chatty seatmates and I love them. They're remarkably comfortable, the sound quality seems great to me and they didn't cost an arm and a leg, what more could you want?"}
{"review":"I've also been fortunate enought to acquire these spectacular phones. I've had mine for 3 years now and they still sound really fantastic. Unfortunately, I have been using them basically every single day anywhere from 2 to 10 hours a day, and have worn the earpads out. So now I have to decide if I will buy another set of M30's or throw down on a set of m40fs'. Either way, I don't think you can go wrong with Audio Technica. I have been extremely pleased with my purchase and would not hesitate to recommend these to anyone looking for clean, strong, dynamic sounding headphones."}
{"review":"I already had sennheiser HD485 and 595, I bought these headphones for just being them closed which is useful for monitoring the recording however they don't block too much noise, I'm unsure about the build of these headphones whether they are durable for longer time. The sound quality can be compared to my HD485 with little pricey than  ATH-M30. The HD485 offer better bass response, more comfort and much stylish than ATH-M30, anyway, I enjoy the sound quality of these cans and at least affordable great headphones can be found of their class."}
{"review":"I'm lucky enough to have XM PCR at work.  For the longest, I used a pair of $20 Koss cans that I picked up at Borders...and they sufficed.  However, they finally broke, so I started a new search and found these.  XM Radio used to be just an additional noise source.  These headphones have completely transformed the experience.  Not only is the sound quality significantly better, but they're way more comfortable on my big melon head.\n\nThe price is right, and the value is great."}
{"review":"These headphones are great.  I am not an audiophile, so I can't comment on sound beyond saying that they sound great to my ears.  The reason I bought them was for comfort, I wear them for 6-10 hours a day, and have yet to get sore or experience any discomfort.  They block out the bus and train noises well, and keep my ears very warm in the cold minnesota winter."}
{"review":"I'm listening to music with the M-30's right now for about the 700th work day straight, and I have to say I'm looking forward to 700 more.  I'm one of those people that listens to music all eight hours of the workday, and these are the best headphones I've come across.  They are very comfortable. I can usually wear them 3 or 4 hours without noticing they are even on my head. And as for bass response, throw on Jamiroquai and tell me you aren't impressed with the balance of the low end. Because buddy, you'd be lying!  These things are professional, make no doubt about it. I've worked on tracks in a studio where all of the headsets were M-30's and the engineers swore by them. This is a great deal, quit searching and scoop them up while you can."}
{"review":"Having only listened to one other \"nice\" (>$100) set of headphones, I don't have much to compare the ATH-M30s to w\/ respect to sound quality. Judged on their own, however, I think they're fantastic - and clearly worth all 50 of the dollars they cost.\n\n- The fidelity is great. Almost too good, actually. The first time I used them I could hear a slightly annoying, high pitched, whine when hooked up to my computer. Turns out it's the cd player and I can pull its internal plug, but this is something that I never heard on my reasonably high end computer monitors.\n\n- They're very light and comfortable. I record and play games with them for hours at a time with very little fatigue. I wear glasses as well, and there can be pressure pain with circum-aural designs, but these are better than any previous set I've owned.\n\n- The cord length is really helpul. I can get up from the PC and move about the room to grab things without taking the set on and off.\n\n- They seem very durable and well made. Solid feeling parts that don't mind being tossed to the side.\n\nLots of praise for these phones on Amazon. So, I'm not adding anything new here, but am another very enthusiastic proponent. Stop searching."}
{"review":"I bought a pair of these for my husband for Christmas, and I'm back on Amazon to buy a pair for myself!  I researched a lot of other brands, but the ATH-M30 had the most positive feedback.  I'm happy to say that everything I read about these headphones turned out to be true: they're durable, comfortable, have excellent sound quality and work well with iPods, computers, discmans, etc.\n\nMy husband has a rather large head, and has complained in the past about headphones hurting his ears and\/or his head after long periods of use.  The ATH-M30's are sturdy, yet light-weight and comfortable.  He LOVES them.\n\nI will say that these headphones do not block outside noise 100%, though they come very close to it.  They also do an excellent job of trapping sound inside the headphones; I cannot hear ANYTHING that my husband is listening to when he is wearing them.  We both fly a lot, so I'm glad to find headphones that will not irritate the person sitting next to me on the plane.\n\nI definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for the best quality headphones without spending a lot of money."}
{"review":"These headphones are great, when you put them on to hear music or something to edit, you can not really hear anything outside of that of the headphones, so it's a great tool to delete those low unwanted hums that you might not have heard without headphones"}
{"review":"I've had these for a month or two now and use them almost every day at work. I'm a software developer and usually end up wearing them for extended periods of time each day.\n\nThe sound quality is awesome, they're quite comfortable on the ears, and while they've taken some abuse, they don't show it at all (durable!). The long cord is great too, I don't need my 3.5mm extension cable any more.\n\nHighly recommended for the price!"}
{"review":"I was looking for a quality pair of headphones that would not cost an arm and a leg.  I found the ATH-M30 listed on Amazon and began researching it.  I decided to purchase them and they arrived a few days later.  The sound was marvelous, exactly what I was hoping for.  There was plenty of clarity and strong bass.  An added bonus was the eleven foot cord which was not a buying point, but comes in handy when moving around the room.  I recommend these to anybody looking for quality headphones without paying through the nose."}
{"review":"I got these a couple months ago because I work in a loud part of the building.  The normal foam headphones that came with the portable CD player sounded OK , but I had to turn up the volume so high to mask the noise that I was worried about my hearing.  After trying 3 sets of around-the-ear headphones from various retail stores, and returning them, I got the ATH-M30's.\n\nThey do a good job at keeping the external noise out, and they really sound good at reasonable (or higher) volumes for most CD's.  Some (mostly older albums) could use a bit more bass, but most have good bass without sounding muddy.  They are crystal clear.  In some songs I had listened to dozens of times, I was hearing new things with these headphones.\n\nThe band is kind of tight, but the cushions around the ears are so large and soft.  They are very comfortable.  They seem well-designed and sturdy but are not all that heavy.\n\nI don't usually bother with doing these reviews, but I'd like people to know how good these are, especially for the price."}
{"review":"I did a lot of research before buying these cans (i learned that name in my research), and I found that it's really hard to find good phones under 75 bucks or so.\n\nI had previously bought a pair of sony's from the store for about 22 bucks (\"hi-fidelity phones\") and they sucked. The mid was way up and the treble way down, and the cord was super thick and didn't coil at all and was really annoying. The sound was better than my iPod ear buds, but I wasn't satisfied.\n\nI, however, am not rich. I have limited spending money. So I wasn't gonna pay more than fifty bucks. Well, after reading comments and visiting sites like headfi.com, I learned that Audio-Technica is a well respected brand. Sennheiser gets a lot of talk (for inexpensive phones) but I couldn't find a pair that got consistently good reviews.\n\nThe ATH-M30 series is great. The sound is way, way better than those Sony's, and iPod ear buds don't even seem like headphones anymore. The bass here is good. It's a balanced bass. Which means you won't get the huge boom of a Bose TriPort (150 bucks) but that it's a solid bass that's present but not overwhelming. The Mid is right where I like it, which is fairly low -- just enough to create a full sound. The treble sounds good to me. I like treble all the way up on an equalizer, and that's how it sounds to me in these cans. Finally, the cord, while long -- too long, really, for portable use with an mp3 player -- coils nicely. If you coil it the way it naturally coils, you can tie it with the twisty tie and it's nice and tidy and small.\n\nBasically, you can't find a better pair of phones for this price, and in my opinion, these are better than a lot of other phones from other brands that cost way more."}
{"review":"Great sound for its price. I've heard better, but those cans were 4 times the price of these, and the only difference was that they were a bit bassier. But these have very good balance, lo, mid, hi, whatever, everything sounds clear and deep. I can hear the different levels of sounds that are being produced. The 'phones also muffle out outside sound a lot, which is a big plus when I'm going through noisy places. For the price that these are being offered, this is the bargain of the century. A very good buy.\n\nI just have one problem with these headphones, and thats the reason why I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars. After a while, my ears feel a bit pinched, maybe because I have big ears and head,  but they still pinch my ears.\n\nOverall, I urge you to buy these headphones. This is the bargain of the century."}
{"review":"I will be using these to do church audio, when i first started reading reviews about headphones it was usually 50\/50 good\/bad and more than once more bad than good. The reviews on these are very accurate, while these are not a Bose QC series headphone for 50usd i don't think you will find a better set. The head band ajustment is smooth and really tight, so they won't loose their adjustment when some one touches them or when you pull them away from one ear to listen to outside noise. The ear pads seem big enough for any average ear, and they seem to keep outside noise out and keeping whatever you are listening to inside.\n\nListening to music: These have rich bass, which i was extremely pleased with, this is not a boom bass but more like that of an Infinity speaker system, the mids are good (could be better) and the high are clear and crisp. Excellent for music.\n\nPlaying Day Of Defeat:Souce will never be the same. One word sums ut up: AWESOME, i am considering replacing my 5.1 Creative labs speaker set with these headphones, as you can hear so much more of whats going on around you.\n\nYOU WILL NOT FIND A BETTER SET UNDER A $100USD quality vs. price."}
{"review":"When my ATH-M30s arrived, I pulled up one of my favorite \"headphones\" songs, and heard details I'd never heard before, despite having listened to this song many times before on car stereo, home stereo, at least three sets of computer speakers, and four different headphones (before the M30s).  I then pulled up a mix of a song I was working on and found several things that should be improved.\n\nIf you are even considering these headphones, just buy them.  They are awesome!"}
{"review":"I am writing this review while using this wonderful headphones -listening \"Juan Luis Guerra y su 440\"-... They are just amazing!\n\nLight, confortable, the sound is so clear that you can discriminate each instrument, just perfect and the price is as good as the product.\n\nMy daugther use them too when she is practicing at the piano -an electric one- and with her iRiver MP3. I will buy another ATH-M30 just for me.\n\nThey are so good, that it is the first product that I comment at amazon even though I am an using amazon almost since the begining."}
{"review":"These Audio Technica babies really let the sound in!  Outstanding in every respect, IMO!\nListening to movies and CDs through these 'phones is a pleasure.  Surround sound effects come through nicely when listening to 5.1-Channel or 2-Channel Surround material, with many subtle surround effects seeping through that you possibly had never heard when listening through your regular speaker system.\nThe sound reproduction on this product seems very \"natural\" and undistorted. And not \"tinny\"-sounding, like can be the case with many different headphone brands.\nExtraordinarily comfy, to boot!  The ear cups don't pinch, or dig into your head. The padded headband adjusts to fit the biggest (or smallest) of craniums. And they don't make your ears sweat like a nervous politician on Election Day (oh, sorry ... I should have said \"perspire\").  :)\nYou can wear these things all day and suffer no ill effects on your head\/ears. (Well, unless, of course, you lay too heavy on the volume control.)\nIt *is*, in fact, difficult to keep the volume in the \"low\"\/\"restrained\" range while using these sonically-pleasing babies. Because they sound so good!\nThe ATH-M30 is an exceptional product; and a terrific bargain to be sure.\nHard to imagine even $100-plus 'phones giving better performance than these."}
{"review":"After purchasing an iPod mini, I thought I could use much better headphones to test the quality of the aiff files provided by iTunes.  I must emphasize that I am not an expert as the other reviewers.  When choosing this pair, I read reviews and looked for high quality under 50 bucks.  These headphones put my big stereo speakers to shame.  I can hear the background singers and instruments I haven't heard before.  They sound completely awesome! (no, really, they do).  There is a little bit of leak, not much.  and they are extremely comfortable and lightweight on the head.  I'll be testing them out extensively this weekend while traveling on airplanes. Update on airplane use:  they are not noise canceling headphones, but they did block the noise of a few verbally obnoxious passengers, and while volume was cranked up, no one knew how much the tunes were cranked up.  My friends that have tried them out call them *amazing*, like a symphony hall.\nAround the house, they block out flushing toilets, dishwashers, and those annoying sounds from the kids' room.  The cord is super long, so I can keep my iPod in it's dock on the kitchen counter and walk around and cook dinner and clean.  And the connector has a strain relief so I know that the cord won't break off from running around.\nI also needed headphones to go with my laptop while watching DVDs and listening to music and other computer things.  Unlike my other cd headphones, these are in stereo and pick up amazing sounds.  Also, they block out the computer sounds of the dvd spinning.\n I suppose they weren't made for household use, but they sound so good, that they will keep me happy for a long time, baby."}
