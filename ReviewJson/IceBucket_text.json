{"review":"I love this ice maker!! Can’t keep up with the ice. It has 3 settings for sizes. The large cubes are humongous. So we keep it on small. Only bad part is the “add water” light doesn’t work."}
{"review":"This ice maker was great...for a while.  Then it started running hotter.  Now there are pieces of black material in the machine.  I was told to and have cleaned several times.  They always come back.  Little almost rubbery pieces.  But there is something not right with the machine.  Do not recommend!"}
{"review":"Don't buy, was dead on arrival, Keeps saying bin full and compressor has yet to come on. CS wasn't any help. Returning unit and getting something else."}
{"review":"I live in a very warm and humid tropical island - thus high need for more ice.  The machine does not produce ice at all in our 85 degree ambient air temperature.  If I move it into an air-conditioned room and set the airco very high, we get a little ice.  Much better to just buy a bag of ice from the market.  Do not recommend, at least in warm climates."}
{"review":"Does exactly what it says and has been great for extra ice when having guests over. I would buy again. Make sure you let the unit stay upright for 5 hours before turning on. You never know what potion the shipping company had it in during transit."}
