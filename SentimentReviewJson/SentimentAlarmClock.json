{"review":"This is a very positive review: Bought this for my office, not as an alarm clock but for the radio.  Sound is good, not Bose Wave good, but I wasn't looking for that.  Compared to most \"clock radios\" I was impressed.  Buttons make it easy to switch stations and signal strength seems to be about average"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I gave this as a gift for someone who wanted programmed push button stations (like a car radio) which was not easy to find. This radio has good reception and sound quality and the feature of digital tuning that we were looking for. If you don't need the digital tuning it may be more expensive than some comparable radios but we are happy with it"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I have to say that I'm quite impressed by the QUALITY of the Sangean RCR-5 clock radio.  Quite a bit of great detail has already been mentioned in a fine way by a previous reviewer.  I just have to say that I'm really impressed at how clear the radio reception is...absolutely NO drift, it locks onto the radio frequency and stays there!  And the sound from the speaker (even if it is just a single speaker) is rather impressive...I've never heard a speaker sound so clear, crisp, and distinct, whether it be music or spoken word!  I also like how smooth the volume control feels. It keeps great time with an easy-to-view display, and wakes you up comfortably with its \"humane waking system.\"  Some people have noted that the settings for the clock are too complex and complicated, but I frankly didn't experience any problems in that sense.  Of course, it does not have the atomic clock updating, nor does it have a built-in cd player, but it does have the auxillary input, if you wanted to connect a cd player or mp3 player.  Overall, I have to say that certainly alot of thought has gone into the designing of the Sangean RCR-5...this certainly is NO ordinary clock radio...it's a finely-crafted instrument!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I started realizing the quality of this radio as soon as I held the box it came in.  It's well packaged in heavy cardboard throughout.  Take the radio out and look it over; you can tell this is not your everyday clock radio you find in all the stores.  It's built solid and the buttons and controls feel solid.  The sound is much better than any clock radio I've ever owned in this price range.  The display is easy to see from all angles and not too brite.  The amber is soft on your eyes unlike some of the blues and greens out there.  Setting the alarms is slightless less intuitive then it could be but it's easy once you do it a few times (the reason for the 4 out of 5 stars).  Products like this are few and far between these days.  High quality and does what it is made to do very well without looking like an alien aircraft with unessessary bells and whistles.  Very possibly the best engineered clock radio for under $50.  Im very happy with my purchase."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I have nothing but praise for the Sangean RCR-5 clock radio.  Specifically, here are the most noteworthy aspects of this truly amazing product:\n\nDisplay\nHere is where the RCR-5 truly shines, as it incorporates a backlit LCD with adjustable intensity:  one may adjust the backlight to suit your needs, so you have a perfectly legible, yet not too bright display (at night) which can never be \"washed out\", even in direct sunlight.  The display even has a clever feature whereby it will illuminate to full intensity when any of the buttons are pressed, after which it returns to the user's preset intensity after ten seconds. As you can see from the product photos, the display is of a soft, warm color, most conducive to a good sleeping environment; other clock radios using bright blue or green illumination, IMHO, should be avoided if you want to get any sleep.\n\nAuxiliary Input\nVery useful for listening to my podcasts at night; when an external source is attached, the Band button will cycle through AM\/FM\/AU; when none is attached, only AM\/FM are available, thereby eliminating \"clutter\" for those who do not wish to enable this feature.  (Note:  I'm old-school, and prefer using this method over a \"Dockable\" iPod solution, as I prefer to completely run my iPod's battery source to zero before recharging...)\n\nFlexibility in Programming\nOnly found on more expensive clock radios, this model will allow you to use the \"Sleep\" feature to listen to a particular station (or podcast with the Auxiliary  feature) at night, and then to wake to radio on a different station.  In addition, all alarms allow Daily, Mon-Fri, or Single, with the Audible Alarm using a gentle \"ramp-up\" feature.\n\nReception and Speaker Quality\nThe radio's receiver portion of this product is very good, rivaled by only my Sony short wave receiver (a great radio, by the way!); what looks like a 3-inch speaker provides a very warm, intelligible output, very suitable for the spoken word, adequate for music.  If you need a strong system for powerful music, I would suggest purchasing an additional desktop speaker setup (such as for a computer) which can be attached to the headphone output by means of a standard mini-jack connection.\n\nFinally, a no-nonsense Sleep function\nSangean has cleverly incorporated the Sleep function into the Power button (which is gently illuminated when the radio's off); to turn the radio on or off, press the button.  To use the Sleep feature, press and hold the same button to select up to 120 minutes.  Simple, effective, \"it just works\".\n\nFinal Recommendation\nWell, what more can I say?  This product works for me (and I'm purchasing three more for gifts) and has a lot going for it, including high value (very reasonably priced!).  Is there anything that you should be aware of?  Yes:\n\n>  As described in the previous customer's entry, setting the alarm may require a few extra key-strokes, as this product offers many options when it comes to waking by either the alarm or the radio; if you do not need all of these features, you may wish to consider something of simpler means.  That being said, it took me only about 22 seconds to set the alarm; for me, it was relatively intuitive and logical.\n\n>  The built-in battery back up feature only works for about ten minutes worth of backup, according to the manual; in my neck of the woods, this is not a big issue, but should be noted if you experience many nighttime blackouts where you are located.\n\n>  Even though this model is referred to as an \"RCR-5\", it should be noted that it does not employ an automatic time synchronization feature as is found on Sangean's higher end clock radios.  (Not a big issue for me, and may actually be desirable for those of us who prefer to set our clocks 5, 10, or 15 minutes fast to \"keep us on time\"!)\n\nI hope this helps you in making the right decision!  All the best!"}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Settings and use are cumbersome and complicated.  To set alarm and change setting requires multiple combinations of pushing buttons to get to area and then resetting all the way through.  Use of the presets is also NOT user friendly.  As a whole, this unit is not made for someone who may need, even on an occasional basis, to set an alarm to a different time.  I would NOT recommend this alarm clock."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This may be a fine item but didn't have the most elemental item and I needed that --- a plug for ear plugs!!!! I returned it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio exceeded my expectations. The instructions for setting up the time were easy as long as one pays attention to how it's supposed to be done. The screen is so easy to see. The fidelity for a small radio is quite good. This is a little gem of a product."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I was very disappointed with the Sangean RCR-5. I did not get very good reception, but in fairness, I rarely do as I live in the mountains.\nI had thought that buying a better brand might have helped that problem.\nI felt like Rip van Winkle, setting not only the time, but the day, the month AND the year every time there was a power shudder !\nHad I really been asleep that long?  There is NO battery back up.\nWorst of all, I couldn't read the time at all.\nThe face is a brownish\/ beige with blackish numbers, and, not Sangean's fault, but I am color blind in the beige range.\nI might have kept it just as a radio if it had had a back up."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Great radio reception and sound.  The display is one glowing amber light with gray numbers, and is not clearly visible.  The alarms are virtually impossible to deal with, even following the manual instructions.  When you think you have them set, they do not work as you think.  If you set it for a radio alarm, that does not happen; instead a very tiny little chirp alarm occurs.  I may just keep this for the radio, turn down the display or tape over it, and buy a real LED alarm clock to sit beside it!!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I also have the WR-11SE and WR-15WL which are great radios. I bought this one in June 2015 and by mid 2017 the membrane buttons that I used often started getting flaky, meaning they intermittently didn't work and I had to press them several times before the function i wanted worked. It is also very easy to hit the wrong button at the extreme left and right. Button labels are tiny and hard to read. Bright screen, so i usually put a book in front of it to block the light from it. Set up, changing the time, etc., is not very intuitive, but if you do it often enough you get used to it. If you don't change settings often, keep the  manual handy. I mostly listen to an NPR station that is about 60 miles away, which is why I bought this radio. My other Sangeans are the only radios in my house, except for my stereo tuner that can pick it up and I have a honking big antennae on that. I would not buy this radio again. I would look for something"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Radio exactly as described and works perfect for desk or nightstand.  Directions, while easy, need to be read before setting the settings.  First radio I have owned that actually has the year shown, I would much rather have the day of the week but that's a personal feeling.  The amber light is different but actually soothing to the eyes.  The radio reception is good, the sound of the music is what one would expect in a clock radio, the channels are easy to program. I would not hesitate to buy a second one.  Would recommend in a heartbeat!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Good idea but it was too difficult for me to set. I sent it back. It might be fine for someone without my particular physical problem. (Hereditary 'essential' tremors)"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: After about a year of use the Sangean reception for AM radio is totally lacking. The buzzing is so loud as to be unfunctional due to the poor Chinese-made switching power supply. Since the clock radio was purchased mainly to listen to talk radio, it has become almost useless to me."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: love this little white box! i'm so happy i finally found a clock radio with an earphone jack. great fm reception, great quality from sangean."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: The FM reception and sound quality is just fine, BUT as an alarm it is way more trouble than it is worth.  The set-up is unnecessarily complicated and after I shut off the FM radio alarm a tone will continue to sound a seemingly random intervals which, after six months I have been unable to disable."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I've had this radio for about 7 weeks now and find myself thinking I made a good purchase. It's easy to program the alarm. In fact it has two alarms that can be set individually. Two things I especially enjoy are the \"humane\" radio wake up. When the radio turns on from the alarm the volume doesn't blurt out at full volume. It starts faintly and then slowly builds up to the alarm volume I wanted it to be when I originally set the alarm. The second feature I appreciate is that there is an input jack that I can plug a sd card player and use the radio's speaker to hear my own chosen music. Not only that but I can set the sd player to shut off in a certain number of minutes and also set the radio's speaker to set off for 60, 45, 30, or 15 minutes. That's a nice deal. Speaker quality could be a little fuller, with more base, but for versatility its a pretty nice deal. Even the orange face color is adjustable and relaxing to view."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The Sangean RCR-5 is a pretty decent am\/fm clock-radio by today's standards (which are rather low).  LCD display is only OK.  LED would be a lot easier to read. One issue I have is that once you set the alarm for the \"once only\" setting, you cannot cancel it until after the alarm goes off.  Other than that, functionally, it works.  The sound is OK, but not as good as the 35+ year old am\/fm clock radio it is replacing.  However, in its price range the sound beats out everything else currently available."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: It's a bit tricky to setup with its many functions, pay close attention to the manual. The sound is okay but not hi-fi.. I'd buy it again if i had too."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I'm very happy with this clock radio.  The manual is lacking and I needed my mechanical husband to figure out how to use the settings.  I like the 2 alarms.  I use one for weekends and the other for week days.  I turned down the brightness of the clock for night. It's very adjustable, but not so easy to turn the dial underneath it with long fingernails. The AM radio gets great reception. It has a numerical volume control you set for the alarm clocks."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I'd recommend this clock radio if you aren't particular.  The radio picks up signal better than many other radios in my home.\n\nMy major criticism is that you can't really read the black text at night.  If you need an office clock with simple radio, this is a decent choice.  But if you'll have a hard time reading the time in the dark, the back-light kind of ruins it the legibility.\n\nIf you need to read the time in the dark, I'd recommend the Sangean RCR-20 instead.  It's a far superior product."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I bought this in September and for the first 3 months it worked perfectly. But now, the display will not set to the correct day. This means that it awakens me at weekday settings on the weekend, and vice versa. That isn't what I paid for."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This Clock Radio is a mixed bag. The clock radio is well built to the standards of years long past. FM reception is great and the clock radio is packed with features. Where this clock radio fails is on the AM band and I suspect it's due to the noisy switching power supply. There's allot of static on the AM band, so much so it's unusable. I like the radio so will keep it but to get full use out of it I'll need to find an old school linear power supply or build a 6 volt battery box to use the AM band.\n\nUpdate, My suspicions were right, I bought a Jameco Linear power supply to replace the noisy switching power supply included with the radio. It's like night and day, AM reception is now fantastic and you don't have to have the radio more than 5 feet away from power supply. The Radio now preforms as it should. I've upgraded the rating to 3 stars but the radio should operate like this out of the box and it doesn't."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Reception is not as good as I hoped, but it is OK.  It has a real sensitivity to anything nearby and the antenna for AM is adequate, but I bought it for AM and the stations I want to receive come in fuzzy.."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very happy with this radio, enough so that this is our second set  one in a bedroom and one in the kitchen. It has better sensitivity and selectivity compared to older radios we had."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Being radio people we wanted a clock radio that had great reception.  This one does.  It has more bells and whistles than we probably need, but so far, it has worked out very well.  I only have one minor complaint....it is difficult to turn the dimmer button on the bottom of the unit.  Not sure why it was places in such an unhandy location, because I have to dim it each night and make it lighter each morning.  But overall....a really nice radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Works well except it took a little effort to get used to the settings.  I like that u can set the brightness as I don't like a bright clock at night.  Looks nice"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: One awesome clock radio. Front panel light can be set to be as dim or as light as you want, that is hard to find, I like a dim light when I sleep. It has two alarms. Alarm goes off to buzz or to music. You can pre set your radio stations and the alarm loudness. The alarm does have some different modes like Monday through Friday, or seven days a week or just weekends.  I would say this is pretty user friendly. Highly Recommended."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: With no battery back up, this clock has to be reset with every power outage.  That would not be a big deal if setting the date, time, and alarm was easy, but it is definitely NOT!  You have to set the alarm for every day of the week in advance.  We stopped using this for the alarm, and just have it in the bathroom where we can listen but don't need to rely on it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: 4 years later still going strong.  Like the fact that it has 2 alarms and can set for weekdays, weekends or once only.  Easy to set."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This clock radio is small but puts out good sound and locks on to stations to give you great sound. The instructions seem a little confusing at first but after 10 minutes or so you will get the hang of it. The LCD on the front is a power saver but it is a tad too bright in normal viewing. The brightness can be turned down but that also diminishes the black numerals, making it harder to read. Still, a great clock radio at a good price."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I have two Sangean clock radios and love them both, but... when will clock radio makers simplify the setting of alarms? Bought this for one of my boys and he no longer uses it because setting the alarms is too complex for him. He now uses his smart phone as a clock radio. Also, why no self dimming feature? Although I love these radios, they are proving impractical and cumbersome to operate. The smart phones are displacing these in my house. Good quality, outdated technology."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Back-light makes viewing the time at in darkness uncomfortable. Worst part is the human interface...poorly conceived, hard to see icons, buttons are not intuitive and are very annoying when you are half asleep. Sound is not good...you get what you pay for."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I bought it because it is one of the few that have an earphone jack so it doesn't disturb my wife in bed.  It is so difficult to program.  It is difficult to operate on the nightstand at night.  You cannot feel which button does what when you're half asleep in the dark.  All the buttons feel the same and I often hit the wrong button and then a while later an alarm comes on and the only way I can figure to turn it off is to unplug the power plug on the back.  It's a TERRIBLE design.  The only feature that I like is the earphone jack.  Why don't other manufacturers include an earphone jack??  I wouldn't recommend this thing.  It's not thought out by anyone who uses it on their nightstand."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: GREAT sound without being overbearing. I went through a lot of clock radios and then having to deal with their subsequent returns. I should have known better. Sangean is fussy about their radios. Excellent reception and excellent sound. If you love to listen to the radio at night, this radio is for you. I listen to classical after bedtime, then talk after midnight. This radio is perfect for both."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio has some nice features and has good radio reception via the external wire antenna.  Pulls in stations that are all static on other radios.  Happy with my purchase."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Just received this radio.  It sets up just fine if you follow the directions, looks good enough (although the black is glossy which allows for fingerprints to show), and the screen is dimmable, which is the main reason I got this one.  It adjusts with a little knob at the bottom of the radio.  If you get it too dim, it might be hard to read from across the room, but I cared more about it not being as bright as a nightlight.  It looks good.  The problem is that I set up the alarm to go off with the radio (and know I have it set to the speaker symbol rather than the bell symbol), but once it goes off, it switches right away to the alarm bell.  I slept through it this morning, but don't want to make it louder because I don't want an alarm bell.  I can get that with my phone.  I've emailed the seller to see what they say, but if it can't be fixed, it's going back.  Edited to add- The seller wrote back right away, but aren't able to give me a fix.  It'll be going back and I've picked up something else that will hopefully work.  Too bad beasue otherwise, it was a good little clock with a radio that picked up difficult stations."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I wanted a white clock radio - which it is.\nI found the alarm VERY difficult to set and unset. We joke that I should just hit it with a hammer and find a different one."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The product definitely delivered on receiving weak FM stations, which has been fabulous. All of my radios \"drift\" and it gets annoying \"chasing\" your favorite station soooo really appreciate the way the Sangean locks in on the station I want to tune in to. I like, too, that it is small enough to fit on my headboard and I can listen to it with earphones so I don't disturb anyone.  A wise purchase!!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Impossible to get AM band, even when cord is five feet from plug. Was all set to return, but I found no suitable replacement that was as attractive and reasonably priced. So cancelled return and am using as FM only in my kitchen. I guess this is a technology about to become obsolete."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Have had mine for 3 years. It is good for strong local stations, but weaker ones which I can pick up on a cheap pocket radio, don't come in at all. It would be nice if it had a back up battery, as the built in temporary storage lasts 3-4 minutes then you have to totally reprogram it. One nice feature is the earphone jack which is very handy for the bedroom."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a good quality radio. Functions are easy and we'll designed. I would have give it 5 stars, but it needs a few things I would want the manufacturer to do. All functions are great, easy to figure out and we'll designed. The only complaint is as follows\n1. The fm antenna, it is a little wire that is very fragile, and just limp and hangs off the back. I see all the review complaint about this and broken ones.  On mine I taped it all bundled up to the back of unit before it gets broke. The manufacturer \"Sangean\", should have put a telescoping antenna on back that can be tucked away or extended to your need.\n2. The preset radio station buttons are on top of unit. Along with several other buttons for various functions. So it is difficult to discern which one is which ad tiu canmot see them. When your in bed, the face of unit is what you see, and trying to reach over and touch top buttons it's easy to bump other functions and not station pretty sets. They did make the \"power\" button illuminated, which is good,but you only use it once. They should have illuminated all the station pre sets buttons, to aid in changing stations without hitting the other functions. Look at pictures of top of unit. Everything is on top. For me, when I'm laying in bed, my unit on night stand, is level with eye. And I cannot see top of unit. And to reach over and touch top, with all the buttons on top, all the same size, its,easy to hit wrong one. And I end up having to turn on my light ,sit up, and see which ones to use. Other than that, it is a good quality radio. I like it alot. I just like to change stations when commercial's come on, and I wish the radio station pre-sets buttons were illuminated to distinguish them from others."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Works well, and has a nice feature set.  I'd like exactly the same clock with LED instead of LCD readout.  With my nearsidedness, there just isn't enough contrast in the readout for me to see what time it is without getting really close."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very good controls and fine sound for a small radio. Manual could be better. Wish it had a battery back up. Power cord connector in back takes space; would be better if a 90 angle."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: Was going to return, but tried it a little longer and decided to keep it.  Its compact for a bed side table, but buttons a little small for people with fat fingers."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: SEND ME YOUR COMMENTS ON HOW EASY\/DIFFICULT IT IS TO SET THE ALARM ON THIS THING. 1-10 SCALE 10 BEING BEST. FOR ME, IT'S COMPLICATED JOKE. MINE'S GOING BACK."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Not worth the money. Too hard to program date, alarm, and time. The one good thing is the radio has excellent sound. The tuning bar that is supposed to be used to program time and date does not work. I have had this about 2 hours trying to set the time and alarm- it is going back as soon as I pack it back up. I gave it one star because of the sound quality of the radio. The manual is poorly written, and the numbers on the diagrams in the manual are too small to be readable without a magnifyi g glass. Very disappointed in this brand and radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Finally a clock radio I can use bed side! A lot of other clock radios use blue light (which is very harsh and can keep you up at night) and are not dimmable. This radio uses an orange dimmable light! The numbers are big enough to easily see and radio is good quality too. I've not set up the alarms yet but it's nice that you can set separate weekday and weekend alarms (something I will take advantage of). Setup is pretty straight forward, the only thing not super clear in the instructions it that to adjust the sleep timer you need to continue to hold the power button down. I wish I had found this years ago. I would definitely buy this again."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It is hard to see the display on this radio from half way across the room.  A few times I have had to do a factory reset to be able to reset the two alarms."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This is the best sounding clock radio we have had.  It has excellent radio reception and a good speaker.  You can program the alarm to go off Mon-Fri, but not on the weekends, so you can leave the alarm set and on all the time, and it will only go off on weekdays,  It also has adjustable alarm volume, so you can make it louder or softer, as needed.  And a convenient Nap timer, to sound the alarm after 15 min to two hours (you set the time), so you don't have to reset your regular alarm. The control buttons are not labeled very well, and are not intuitive, so you will definitely have to consult the instruction book many times until you figure it out.  But once you do, you will love it."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Unfortunately, I am disappointed with this clock radio. It's not for people with bad eyes. I can't see the time in the middle of the night without my glasses. I have to squint. It shouldn't be that difficult. Sound is good. The reality is that I liked my previous clock radio but it finally died. I use sleep timer a lot but if I want to set it for 30 minutes, I have to open my eyes as it passes thru the other possibilities. Because it is plastic, it is slippery. You need 2 hands sometimes. One just to hold it while turning volume dial with the other."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very good quality; works great. Does everything a clock radio should do very well. Sounds good for what it is (don't expect miracles).\n\nI would prefer it if it were vertically oriented instead of horizontal. It has a large footprint. If it were upright, it would have a much smaller footprint and a forward-firing speaker (the speaker faces upward). Perhaps some people prefer its low-profile design though.\n\nVery happy with it overall."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Similar to many reviews, it's very subjective to what you're looking for. Biggest problems to me are no battery backup, so when power goes out you have to go through several steps to reset it. My 20 year old Sony Dream Machine has backup. Antennae is nothing special. I was hoping to draw more stations on a newer, higher tech radio. But alas, it's not the case. Snooze needs settings. 5 minute snooze is too short. This all said, it's an alarm clock and does that well enough. The music can be set to come on softly and increase in volume; nice touch."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I live in a rural area between Houston and Beaumont in  Texas and usually have difficulty witih some stations, especially in the evening.  I LOVE that with this radio, which is simple to setup, I have GREAT reception of ALL stations at ALL times of the day.  This one is in my bedroom, and I am considering purchasing a second one with battery back up for another room and for disasters. Highly recommend."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: From what I use it, it's fine. I like that it has a plug-in for earbuds so I can listen when I'm going to sleep - I just  set the timer for 60 minutes.  The sound otherwise is not great which I don't care it's not my primary source of radio.  Alarms work fine.  And I like that the light on it brightens when making changes  but dims  within a few seconds.  I live in a high-rise, still can't get a.m. radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: What good is a digital clock radio if 1) The year, date, and time cannot be set via the Tuner button, yet the Tuner button works to reach stations? 2) The secondary digital stations such as 89.1.2 are not accessible? Reaching the secondary stations is why I BOUGHT digital. The radio came out of the box 30 minutes ago and is going right back to Amazon. I'll buy something else."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This a nice compact and functional radio\/alarm clock.  This is the second one I bought for two different rooms.  I like the AC adapter that provides DC input, which reduces noise, especially for AM stations.  The humane alarm that starts soft and gradually builds up does not jar you out of a restful sleep, but wakes you up more gently over a few seconds.  Simple, understated, but well designed.  Well written instruction manual."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Buttons are too small and too close...  Can't stand these snooze and various timed settings and alarm... ONE ALARM that sounds. PERIOD\/  Don't like the low contrast lighted display."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: This radio is hard to figure out, volume does not work, I long for the days of the \"simple and uncomplicated\" - I WOULD NOT recommend this radio"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Exactly what I wanted.  Good clear sound--not boomy and artificial.  It replaced my iHome iBT38 which sounded like it was located at the bottom of a barrel.  I disagree with the many comments regarding the difficulty to adjust settings.  The way to set date, time, year is similar to many home electronic devices:  select, set, select, set...  It's almost intuitive...just read the short manual!  I do wish it had LCD display dimming through an accessible top button instead of a set-screw on the bottom of the unit.  Otherwise, it is exactly as advertised.  Incidentally, this is my third Sanjean radio.  All are great!\n\nOne addendum.  I agree with another purchaser's comment that it is ridiculous that to change the time on the alarm, you have to cycle through all the alarm set up steps..."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Just one problem. I listen in bed and the station selection buttons are in line with other function buttons and it's too easy to turn on alarm or nap buttons when trying to change stations."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Piece of... well *%$#!  This company is advertised as building radios that rival the quality of more expensive manufacturers. While that may be true for one of their products, don't know which if so, this radio is literally worse than my ten dollar portable at locking in weak stations or receiving them at all. We live in the TampaBay area with a bunch of AM stations. AT night all the stations reduce their power but this radio only receives one and that with static, no matter how we turn it or place the extended antenna. In addition, the battery \"back up\" only keeps the settings for 10 minutes if the power goes out and forget about playing it. The radio is garbage in my opinion. DON'T BUY IT."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought 2 of these hoping for good things, and I wasn't disappointed. I own 2 other Sangean radios, and I love them both. Sangean still makes quality radios like some used to make. I appreciate quality in products, and I am happy to write about them.\n\nI was looking for a feature-packed clock radio, and to my disappointment, they really don't exist anymore. I am guessing due to the smartphone. Well, I turn my phone off at night, and like to have a clock radio wake me up. I was looking for a few things:\n\nA quality name\nA typical old-school styled clock radio\nSimple to operate\nAn adjustable display light as to not keep me up at night\nA prominent snooze bar\n\nThis clock impressed me right out of the box. All of the buttons click, as well at the volume dial on the side. The display is LCD with a soft orangish backlight that is fully adjustable with a turn knob on the bottom (the best radios, even in their heyday didn't have this). The sound is full and not tinny like some. It looks like a roughly 3\" speaker, and for what it is,  its not bad at all. The size of the case is just right. If I could find a complaint, it would be the 5 minute snooze time. I must admit, I use it, and I would rather not have it go off so often; I will just have to get up, then. Lastly, you can set each alarm to a station you want, a set volume, and you can set it to M-F, Sat-Sun, All, or only to go off once. There is also a Nap timer that will go to 2 hours if you want it. Nice. There is a 10-minute battery back-up, but don't be fooled, its not a battery. My guess is that it is a capacitor that stores a bit of juice for the clock only. I'm really not bothered by this. Oh, and the tuning bar is a direct-tune bar, or a station-seek bar. Again, the best never had that. They really combined the best of their radios, and a clock.\n\nIf you have looked, I'm sure you've been disappointed, like me. I completely recommend this clock radio. Sangean seems to be an affordable brand, that makes them the way you want them. I don't know how you can go wrong with this one."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I use it a with pillow speaker and the sound is great. Picks up most of my favorite distant stations. Liked it so well ordered another for the other bedroom."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Audio quality is nice. It's easy to set up too. Best feature for me is the dual alarm since I work two different schedules from week to week."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Perfect size for night stand. It is a soft white. Wakeup to nice easy music instead of crazy bell alarm. Good sound system. Price was worth it."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Initially, I loved the radio's quality.  But over time, it has two annoying features.  1. The radio often fades out, and then with a little coaxing, it decides to come back to full volume.  2.  I cannot - and I've invested too much time - figure out the alarm.  I don't use the alarm feature, but this little sucker goes off because I've inadvertently set it, and I cannot CANNOT figure out how to tell it to not go off... ever.  The instructions (on-line) refer to controls that are labelled differently on the device."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Biggest purchase mistake I've made in a long time. Making or changing any setting is so convoluted that, unless you make changes frequently, you'll have to get out the manual every time to figure out how to do it. HUGE negative for me. No clock radio should be this difficult to operate. I bought the radio because it has station pre-set buttons, but everything else about this radio I hate. Would strongly advise against purchase."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I recently ordered this clock radio and gave it about a three week trial.  There are some things I really like about this radio and some things that I really don't like.  I'll share both here.\n\nLIKES\n1. For a radio this inexpensive, the sound was quite good.  Not Bose Wave good (nor nearly as expensive), but still much better than your average cheap desktop or clock radio.\n2. The look is nicely understated, both in the chassis and the muted warm light display.  (I bought the white model.)  It doesn't scream out \"I'm a clock radio\".  So it fits in with a bedroom decor well.\n3. The dual alarm is nice, so you can set a weekday and a weekend alarm without having to change it every few days.\n4. The Humane Wake System, where the radio (or alarm) starts soft and gets louder gradually is a nice alternative to the jarring instant-on of most clock radios.\n\nDISLIKES\n--The human interface is horribly designed--\n1. In addition to the the up\/down bar (which is fine) for numerical settings, there are 11 other small buttons which are virtually identical in size, shape, and feel.  And 9 of them are tightly bunched in one straight row.  They all feel the same, so there is no way of knowing which button you're pushing without memorizing the positions (if you're blind or it's dark) or turning the light on and looking.  And because the on\/off\/snooze button is surrounded by two other identical buttons, it's nearly impossible to find it when the alarm goes off without groping around with your finger touching every button until you come to the correct position for the button you want or turning the light on.  Either way you probably wake up your sleep partner.\n2. Setting a single alarm involves three separate buttons.  And you can't just do a couple touches.  You have to go through a minimum of five button pushes to navigate through all the options, more if you actually want to change one.  And if you're slow (just a couple seconds) on any option, the display kicks back to the non-alarm display mode and you have to start all over.\n3. The sleep option is nice, but you have to choose from the predefined time lengths of 60, 45, 30, 15, etc. minutes.  You can't just specify how many minutes (e.g. 10) that you want.\n\nAlthough I liked the above Likes, the Dislikes (especially #1) were maddening enough that I returned this clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This radio has excellent sound but the numbers are impossible to read at night. I have it in the kitchen, and listen to classical music and the news. Actually I bought another one for my son, whose music choices are more main-stream."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I would have rated it 5 stars except that when dimmed the display becomes close to impossible to read at night and you have to compromise between dark enough to not be distracting to sleep and bright enough to read.  It works fine during the day at pretty much any brightness setting.  A shame because I would have liked to be able to rate it a 5 star product."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very nice small dual alarm clock.  I really like this brand (this is the third item I own).  This has alarm features on it that my last one didn't.  I can set one alarm for Monday through Friday for work and the the other for those single instance days when I need to be up at a certain time.  The speaker is great.  I like the adjustable backlight."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The display is hard to see with my older eyes.  This is not aitomatic or atomic.  In fact very manual and does to have a battery.  I jave had to set this clock 4 times since it arrived"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I just received it and I am almost 64 years old, a female and technically challenged.  I had NO PROBLEM following the directions and it is next to my bed now waiting for my wake up call in the morning.  Seems to have everything on it I wanted and more.  Nice size, not large or bulky.  The tuner is really good and the music comes in very clear.  I did buy the warranty just in case for the small fee.  If I have any challenges after a month or two, I will write again."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I searched far and wide for a basic alarm clock radio that wasn't hideous or stuck in the 80's. This is the only one. Works great."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: a little hard to program all the necessary info for 24 hr vs other time, date and such. I still cannot get the correct date and year to work. I gave up.the instructions were useless. The face light is dimmable but the letters are hard to see if light is dimmed. But sound is nice and so far I have had good reception. I like the design and smooth style."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I needed to replace my bedside clock radio (it was easily 15 years old) and this seemed like a high-quality substitute.  The old one was so easy to set for time and radio station and alarms--especially for daylight saving\/standard time adjustments.  This one is so over-overcomplicated that it beggars description.  I wasted an entire afternoon trying to get the settings sorted out and I finally gave up, went to the Amazon website to get the wherewithal to return it and got it out of the house as fast as possible.  Yikes!!  I ended up in a big-box store where I found a perfectly good replacement for less than half the price of the Sangean.  BTW: Amazon had the refund in my account with incredible speed.  Five stars for THAT!"}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Blew out wall socket.  Poor user info.  Frustrating to set alarm - if you change the setting, have go through a three step process."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is exactly the clock radio I was looking for. It's decent looking in my bedroom and easy to use. I thought the orange backlight would bother me, but I love how you can adjust it. Really good!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: A little confusing to figure out sometimes, but it's exactly what we needed, because my husband can plug his sleep speaker in and I don't have to listen to the radio all night long"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: It's hard to find a good clock radio anymore, but this is one. Clean sound, keeps time well, and two sets of alarms in memory. Minus one star for the display. I would have preferred the numbers be lit on a black background, instead of the other way around as it is now. Even with the brightness turned all the way up, it's hard for me to read the display from my bed (clock is placed across the room from my bed, so I actually have to get up and walk around to turn the alarm off)."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: THE ABSOLUTE WORST!I've had this piece of crap for two years and it is HORRIBLE! Do not purchase one or caveat emptor!  First the on\/off button for the radio quit working and now you can't set the time!  Totally planned obsolescence on the part of a Chinese\/Amazon (synonymous) company."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Most counter-intuitive and unnecessarily super-miniaturiazed and hard-to read controls of any digital alarm I have ever seen. Set-it and pray.\n\nFM Tuner, OK.\nEverything else wins the \"Huh?\" Awards."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: It was OK as far as a clock but could not receive the local stations I wanted which was the reason I wanted a clock radio with easy change of station."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love the dimmable display.  Perfect size for my bedside.  A 5+ would be for the alarm icons to be larger and easier to read."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Works as advertised - manual included and easy to read. Alarm, whether radio or buzzer, ramps up from soft to louder, with maximum volume adjustable when setting the alarm. I would recommend this item to others."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Many clock radios have fm antenna in power cord, those do not work well. This has a separate thin fm wire antenna, works great.  Presets are extremely convenient."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It does everything it is supposed to do. Except for one thing - at night, one can't see the numerals on the yellow-lit display if one is on the same eye level as the display, such as when lying in bed and looking at the clock that sits on a nightstand... You will needto sit up, or to tip the clock, to see what time it is."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: No battery backup--power failure you must go back to square one.  Buttons are all the same so it's difficult to use in the middle of the night. Bought for pillow speaker adapter. Only model available."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I remember when all radios had vacuum tubes and phones had party lines; am an acoustic musician with little technical savvy.  I programmed this radio in a few easy minutes.  Next morning I smiled as it woke me precisely, with superior sound for its compact size.  I appreciate the keen eye for imperfection of previous reviewers, but feel that the nits they picked are swamped by the radio's strengths.  Such thoughtful, successful design.  The manual has been rewritten and improved since some of the reviews below.  Radio looks nice. Once again the ConsumerSearch site proves a reliable source of advice; I have used it for a dozen or 15 years, to supplement Consumer Reports or replace it.  It is a review of reviews like this one and not limited to products its engineers can test."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Good AM reception - functions are straight forward - but the display is not very readable.  So had to keep old large display clock radio for  the clock function."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I don't like it at all. Will sell it for 5.00.  You set it to wake to FM on a certain station and it wakes tuned to another channel with no station and white noise.  Dont buy this one"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Replaced another older clock radio with this unit. It's surprisingly compact in size. Easy to set up, and the best part....it gets awesome FM reception! The old clock radio did not receive the local FM stations well. Lots of static. This one is crystal clear sitting in the same spot as the old one, and I didn't need to unravel the wire antenna! I don't use the alarm feature so I can't review on that. Works very well and I'm happy with the purchase."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The radio was exactly what I was looking for. One of the very few that have an earphone jack. It would, however, be helpful if the product description included the fact it has a headphone jack."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The item appears to be well made and the radio sounds good but do not like the item because adjusting the Display Backlight Adjustment button to a brightness level that is not distracting at night renders the time to a level of not being visible. Because of this we have now moved the Sangean RCR-5 Digital AM\/FM Clock Radio to our fitness room and are looking for a replacement for our bedroom."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very pleased with the reception.  I'm in a difficult area and have gone through two other radios for my kitchen.  I put this on top of the refrigerator and extended the antenna across the top of the refrigerator.  I just listen to talk radio, and want a little noise when I'm in the kitchen.  It worked much better than other radios for this.  I would buy this again."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I really like the design of this radio. But today it didn't wake me up - because it won't change the day of week. I set it for Wednesday, and then it stays on Saturday. Tough on the weekday wakeup. I had another radio by this maker - the taller one with more sound. Also liked the design but it lasted two years before the speaker went crackly. I won't by another radio by this maker."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I like my clock and size.  Disappointed that the time is actually hard to read.\nBackground color does not make numbers stand out.  Also, I thought it would be easier to set, although directions are good."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: When I received this radio two months ago I absolutely loved it! It replaced a 30 year old Panasonic that had finally died. I still love the design and the sound. I find it relatively easy to set and I enjoy having the 5 pre-sets for each band.  BUT....yesterday, it suddenly stopped waking to music and no matter what I did, it only used the beep for the alarm. After re-reading the manual, I did a factory re-set and was able to get the alarm to wake to the selected radio station. The factory re-set is easy. I am hoping that the unit will no fail going forward."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It is pretty good. Awesome interface. did not expect it to know the date. I was disappointed it did t have a 24 hr option format for time. Radio is pretty good, but is similar in signal strength with a wire antenna. Low quiet footprint and profile"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I connected to my Amazon Echo Dot via the AUX port. Nice size with a great display.  The sound is a bit tinny......and is just barely better than the Dot's speaker."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Speaker is small and tinny-sounding, but radio reception is very good, well above average. I used to get static with my other bedside radios, not this one. Always clear."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Nice radio....great sound. I like the fact it has several preset channels available. I like the 2 alarms settings.\nFor me I'm not crazy about the way the alarm has to be set as many days I get up at different times. If I forget to set the alarm to the proper time before going to sleep it seems a major project when I remember in the middle of the night to reset it. Just my problem is all. Other than that ....great radio !"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: As advertised it is small size, big sound. It is smaller than I expected, but small is good. It leaves more\nroom on the nightstand for a book, glass of wine and chocolate. It does lock into stations so much better than what we had. My wife appreciates the earphone jack, as I like to listen to the radio falling asleep. We both like the adjustable dim & brightness of\nthe background light."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Always heard great things about this brand.  The unit was moderately easy to program for needed use. Performance was lacking in AM radio reception.  Built in AM antenna too directional:  Had to literally turn the unit 90 degrees to receive a usable signal, which makes it difficult to read the clock...  Not fun or useful."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: even at dim, the light is too bright at night.  Had a hard time figuring out the alarm  awful reception for am  bought expecting a better radio for my wife extremely disappointed  no better then the radios I was trying to improve on"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: AM tuner less than stellar (and that's what I listen to the most), control buttons are hard to ID by feel in the dark, Alarm programming hard to figure out.  But it was the best for my needs, albeit from a very narrow field.  It has a headphone jack which most clock radios don't have these days."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The read out is hard to see at nite. Am reception is non existent.  The functions and buttons are not user friendly. All considered I'm sorry I purchased this. I took it to my office to use where I can use it for only one channel, not needing the real reason I got this model, earphone jack."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a great alarm clock. I bought a Tivoli Model 3 BT two months before I bought the Sangean. The Sangean as an alarm clock beats the Tivoli hands down. What do you get from the Tivoli at 9 times the price? Better sound. But the Tivoli is a crappy alarm clock. The analog hands are so small it's hard to tell what time it is on the Tivoli. The Tivoli doesn't  have two separate alarms settings or an alarm that starts out soft and wakes you up gently; the Sangean does. I read a lot of positive revues on the Tivoli before my purchase but I soon found out that they were all skewed because some folks think that paying a lot of money means your getting a better product; oh how wrong you can be. On the Sangean my only ding would be some of the settings are a little hard to figure out the first time you set them. But once they're set it works great.  The great reviews are well deserved on the Sangean. If your looking for clock radio that's in the top 10, here you go."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Unlike the RCR-22, Sangean's RCR-5 has a tinny cheap speaker for radio.  I know because I purchased both and compared them side by side.  I wanted the RCR-5 to replace the RCR-22 which I found unusable due to the bright blue light, even on its dimmest setting.  I had read that red light would not disturb sleeping as much.  I'm not sure.  The red light is not dimmable.  Just like the RCR-22, the RCR-5 has an inscrutable operating instruction manual.  My favorites include \"damage the furniture of your radio\".  Also \"the Sleep control begins when you release the Power button\".  Like the RCR-22, the RCR-5 has contextual buttons without clear instruction about what selects the context!  When you first set up the time, you must start with the year and wait no longer than 10 seconds between each piece of information the clock requires, or you will have to restart forrom the beginning.  I just want a simple clock radio with decent speakers and radio presets and red digital numbers.  I can't understand why that is so hard to find!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great Quality - Great Functions - Contrary to a few reviews, easily programmed (IMO) without using the manual, quite intuitive -- An electronic device that may actually be worth the price"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Bought this radio for the sole reason that it has an earphone jack as I like to listen during the night without disturbing my partner. Wish it had an auto shut off like my previous radio...after 60 min on the snooze button it turned off. It came with no instructions at all so I had to wing it. Not terribly user friendly but it serves its purpose."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Sangean has given some thought to the bedside alarm clock in an elegant black case.  Comes with two alarms and you can preset the station and volume you want for your alarms.  The unit will even lower the volume to wake you up with the volume specified in your setting not the last volume you used. The orange backlight can be lowered to the desired brightness or turned off altogether. You can see the time at night without being bothered by unnecessary brightness.  The sound is warm, perfect for news or music.  Only drawback I can find is the linear arrangement of eight buttons might be confusing at night but this can be solved by using some tape or Velcro to make buttons more tactile."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: A Christmas gift.  I use my beside clock radio for one main purpose:  to listen to my local public radio station while I fall asleep or if I awake at night.\nI like several features:  1)  has an earphone jack, so I don't disturb my husband. 2) Power button is lit, so I can easily see it in the dark.  3) Using that power button,  I can set the auto-off for 15, 30, 45 or 60 minutes.  3) i LOVE that the volume level is shown in the display, so if I want to adjust volume as I put in the earphones, I know to turn the dial to \"07\" - no jarring my eardrums.  4)  The alarm, which starts low and increases with volume, can be heard both through the earphones AND externally.  So if the earphones slip out while you are asleep, you still hear the alarm when it goes off - most radios do NOT do this.  5) It is a nice compact radio.\nWhat I don't like:  1) As other reviewers have noted, setting it up and setting alarms, etc. is not intuitive.  Keep that manual handy.  2) I don't care for the amber display - my last radio had a black display with green numbers.  This seems brighter, but not intolerable.  3) Sound is just ok - like I said, I rarely have music on, mostly news and information and that comes through fine with the earphones.  Sound is not as clear if I use without earphones - speaker is on top of radio.\nI've been using it over a month now, and have no problems."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The different alarms\/ or radio are alomost impossible to set and even then you're not sure if it is set correctly as there is nowhere to see what time and station the alarm is set for. I actually bring an iphone and use it as an alarm. On this radio, the digital tuning is great."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: After repeated attempts, I finally got an alarm set. Now I want to change the setting to \"once\" rather than seven days a week and for the life of me can't figure out how that's to be accomplished. What the manual advises and what works turn out to be two entirely different things. When it comes to \"user friendly\", for this user it's been only a headache. Sorry I've missed the return date to send it back--I've now disconnected it and am unfortunately resigned to writing it off as a waste of money."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Wonderful radio! Had lots of frustration with my previous 2 radios have stations drift in and out with volume changing as you moved towards or away from the radio, even weather conditions seemed to have affected signal strength. Started to believe the metal lamp next to the radio and its location in room were the culprits after having two radios in the same spot with same reception problems. This radio sports a trailing external antenna  and hosts none of the previous radio issues. The clarity of speaker is great but also has a port to plug in ear buds for private listening during those wide awake periods during the middle of the night < speaking from experience >!  As a note.. the buttons for operation are \"unlit\" and until you become familiar with placement can be a challenge in the dark."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: A piece of junk! Radio will not work with any object next to it, The digital screen at night is not well defined. The alarm is very difficult to operate and there if no indication of whether what you entered is actually entered. If you want a radio,  buy a radio. If you want an alarm, buy an alarm. The designers of this thing must have been paid by the # of functions they could jam into this box,"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It's a great little user-friendly radio.  It was important to me to find a radio I could use with a mono earbud.  It fits all my requirements for an AM\/FM clock radio.  The only feature I would have liked was to have a battery back-up in case of a power cut."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: sangean radios tend to fail within six months.  have had five portables, keep buying them because i need the product and there are very few choices out there.  this is my first table top, keeping my fingers crossed."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Good sound quality. Easy to program channels to preset buttons.  Dual alarm settings makes it easy to set a normal alarm and a separate one for special circumstances."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Good sound. Strong plastic. Non-potentiometric volume control that won't wear out. Everything about it gives the impression of quality. Humane waking system wakes you without startling (though I wish it were even more gradual). But... The display contrast is not very good. Relative to the LED display on our old clock radio, the Sangean's is hard to see. The indicators for the alarm being armed are inconveniently small. Changing the alarm time setting requires going through many additional steps in order to save the change, even when nothing is changed in those steps."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Used it one day and so far I like it. It was very easy to set up, the sound is more than adequate for a radio alarm (clear at louder volumes as well as low).  Instructions were intuitive and easy to understand.  I am rather pleased with this- it replaces a twenty year old clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This was my second Sangean radio, I will never buy another. The alarm on this one would never stay set as programed and I followed the instructions properly several times including resetting it back to the factory settings and restarting from scratch. It would randomly alarm on the radio station I was last listening to, or might go off on the alarm bell, or it might alarm on the actual radio station I had set it to; but you could never reliably tell. Secondly the only way to turn off an alarm completely was to go back to the factory settings which means you had to reset everything starting from the year, date, time, etc. You could not just hit a button and turn off the alarm permanently, the best you could do was set the alarm to go off once but then it would go off one more time and if you needed to shut the alarm off without it going off never again you were simply out of luck. Maybe I just got a bad one but again this was the second bad Sangean radio I've gotten, that first one costing $170. and also with unsolvable bugs."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is the fourth Sangean radio I have purchased over the years. I first encountered Sangean back in the 1980s when I was shopping for a decent portable shortwave radio. That radio, an SG-792, is still going strong more than 30 years later. The second was a Realistic DX-440, a rebadged Sangean ATS-803A -- a $200, full-blown PLL-synthesized AM\/FM\/SSB shortwave receiver that served me well for more than a decade until I sold it to a friend back in the '90s -- a decision I've been regretting, and I'm currently eyeing the used ones on the auction sites. My third Sangean is an RCR-2 \"atomic\" clock radio that I found on a shelf at a Goodwill store a few years ago; it's still going strong and keeping split-second time.\n\nAs for this one, I seem to have a thing for discovering Sangeans at thrift stores, because I stumbled across this RCR-5 (white), new in the box, at a thrift store about a month ago. (I paid ten bucks for it, nyah nyah.) Since this was an impulse purchase for no other reason than I love Sangean products, there was no comparison shopping or reason to nitpick here. Being an amateur radio operator for the past three decades, I came home and put this little baby to the test -- and I have not been disappointed. Sangean's hallmark is excellent sensitivity and selectivity for a portable consumer radio. Here in my home office in the Richmond, Virginia area, I found myself listening -- for quite a while -- to the Grand Ole Opry on WSM in Nashville one recent evening, then moving over to WLS (Chicago) and WCBS (NYC) for a while. It's a very nice bedside radio for the broadcast band DX'er, as they call those of us who find satisfaction in \"pulling out the weak ones.\" Easy to tune -- I *hate* radios that \"take off on scan\" when you press the tuning buttons. This one allows you to tune around without it thinking, \"You couldn't possibly want to stop *there*!!! ... and taking off up the dial. (I have an old Panasonic that's a great radio but tries to outsmart you by skipping over weak stations, and that annoys me. *I* am the master of my tuning control!)\n\nI haven't played with the alarms yet, but since they're identical to the ones in my RCR-2 (i.e. Humane Wake System and dual alarms settable by week\/weekend etc.), I can say that they're easy to understand once you've set them a few times. Regarding display brightness, there's a brightness control underneath the radio that allows you to control the brightness from impossibly dark to nightlight-bright. If you have it set for anything less than full-bright, the display will \"wake up\" to full brightness when you press a button and then revert back to your setting after a few seconds. There are also a couple of \"hidden\" features (well, hidden only to purchasers who don't read the instructions for products they purchase, which is dumb): The display can be changed from 12- to 24-hour format, and you can also change the way it displays the date when you press the Time Set \/ Display button.\n\nI must make one comment in response to all the reviews about the capacitive 10-minute, non-battery backup feature ... about a week ago, a transformer blew a circuit breaker in my neighborhood and my power was out for about an hour. Once the power came back on, I walked into the office prepared to reprogram the Sangean, only to discover that all of its settings were still intact. So my guess is, they stated 10 minutes to \"CYA\" -- but YMMV. Mine certainly did.\n\nSangean has a reputation for quality componentry, and the buttons and knobs on the radio are all quite tactile. In fact, the volume control feels downright high-end -- very smooth and fluid-feeling. And it's rubberized, making it easy to locate by feel and adjust with clumsy, half-asleep fingers. Audio? Typical Sangean high quality. I read somewhere that Sangean doesn't believe in selling a radio with substandard audio -- and while this little guy might be fairly entry-level, they didn't forsake their trademark sound quality. And they place quality speakers in their radios that are designed to handle the audio output with little to no distortion, even at high volume levels. Another fine little Sangean product to add to my collection!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: If you are looking for an AM radio this is a great one! The reception is excellent. I've had been looking for quite some time for a great AM radio. I like to wake to the news in the morning and finally found one!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I like this radio.  Unfortunately, it has one flaw which makes it useless to me.  I listen through headphones, and when I set the volume control to its maximum setting, the sound is still way too soft.  I will be returning this radio, as this flaw is fatal for my needs."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: descent radio\nmy unit had a universal power adapter input: 110\/220 V 60\/50 Hz.\nSo to convert to Europe power outlet you need only simple plug adapter."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Overall this is an excellent radio for my use.  I use the headphone jack, the sleep and nap features and love the preset stations.  The speaker is OK but not fantastic.  Sound through headphones is very good and headphones allow me to listen at night without disturbing my husband. An improvement I would make is to make it easier to distinguish among the button in the long row on top.  I put a small bit of thick tape to mark the first and last of the 5 pre-sets so, in the dark, I can feel where I am on this row.  I can imagine a few well placed bumps on the case to indicate to the location of key buttons."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This is an excellent clock radio.  The A\/B alarm settings are especially nice.  That allows you to have one permanent setting for your work week that you can turn off when necessary and use \"Alarm 2\" for a one-off or secondary setting for vacation and off days.  When it's time to go back to work on your regular schedule, you simply reactivate \"Alarm 1\" without having to go through all the setting.  My only complaint (wish really) is that the \"nap\" setting also had the option to activate the radio as the regular alarm does.  Instead it only sets off a horribly annoying beeping which is not at all pleasant to wake up to."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Very inferior product.  It is a light-weight plastic box with instructions that do not produce any results. I'm so frustrated with spending so much time to place the correct time with only an A.M. logo showing, and wasting time to get the alarm to work.  So disappointed."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This is my second Sagean. Distant stations are received with clarity. This is important for commuting weather and traffic. Sound is good, but not the best for music. This is our \"go to\" device for morning newscasts and getting ready to commute into the city. Hang on to the instructions. Set-up is not intuitive."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Decent sound, for a small speaker, but better than most other clock radios I've heard. Good functionality.\n\nOne problem I found; the wake up settings can include which channel to play, which is a nice feature. Except, if I go to sleep listening to a different channel, the wake-up alarm sounds instead of the chosen channel playing. If I want to hear channel-1 upon awakening, I can't go to sleep listening to channel-2.\n\nOther than that, I'm happy with this item."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was just looking for a simple radio for the kitchen to keep my dog company when I wasn't home.  I like the digital tuning aspect so that I now don't have to deal with periodic static when I walk around.  This tunes in perfectly,is easy to turn on and off and has a nice clear sound.  I like the digital illuminated clock so I can check the time without have to squint at the stove clock.  I'm sure my dog likes it as well but would much rather I stay home with him.\nNice product."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Bought this for my wife who needed a digital radio\/alarm clock to replace her cheap analog version.  This clock radio works great.  It get decent AM reception, way better than the old unit.  The feature that causes the alarm or radio to start softly and then build to full volume is wonderful.  My wife loves that feature.  She has learned how to program the alarm setting without a whole lot of trouble.  Finally we love the ability to adjust the brightness\/dimness of the display for day time or night time. All in all, we are very pleased with the Sangean Clock Radio"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Like everything made in China the instructions are so small you can't read nor make out the labels.  I am just getting ready to see if I can find an online instruction manual and parts labels big enough to read.  I sometimes think that Chinese manufactured items instructions are produced so unreadable just to punish non-communist world."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Works great, very dimmable, good radio reception (love that it has presets).\n\nOne weird thing is it counts seconds along with the time. Not ecessarily something you want in a clock next to your bed\n\nThe face tips down a bit, nice to keep room illumination down but my nightstand is low so i keep a book under it"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I love this radio.  Once you understand how to set the alarms, resetting them becomes quite simple.  This radio is very dependable and does its job very well.  The one thing that my wife and I like about the alarm (both radio alarm and beeping alarm), is the fact that when the alarm goes off it starts off at a very low volume and gradually gets louder until it reaches the volume level that you set.  I would highly recommend this alarm to anyone."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a perfectly usable clock radio. It was easy to program after reading the instructions. The sound quality is good. I like the compact size. The more advanced models seemed to have a lot more problems according to the reviews, so this is great for getting me up in the morning, really all I need. However, like another reviewer of this radio, I HATE watching the seconds displayed. Why would anyone need to see time in seconds? I wake up and look at it and feel like an insomniac."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The Sangean RCR-5 Digital AM\/FM Clock Radio is very good clock radio that lacks the advanced features of some newer clock radios, but what it does, it does well. The display is very easy to see, and the brightness can be adjusted from very bright, to all the way off. It's easy to set. The radio works well. It has good reception on both bands, and sound quality is about what you'd expect from a small mono speaker radio. There is a headphone jack and auxiliary input too. It does exactly what I bought it for, and I'm happy with it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: if you are over 40 and need reading glasses you will need to put them on in the morning to see the numbers .sangean makes a great radio I own several but the display on this is not for me I will end up putting this in the bathroom"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Nice build quality, just the right amount of functions & are easy to use. Instead of brightly lit numbers, they are black with an adjustable mellow lit background. FM stations come in easily thanks to the external wire antenna; 4 AM stations come in ok, which is typical for where I live. I would recommend."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I purchased this radio to use at my desk at the office.  I love the look, the digital stations that can be preset and the headphone plug.  This radio fit my need perfectly!  And there is another aux plug for my iPod too!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: A nice size clock radio.  It was a little hard to set up the stations, but we finally figured it out.  I purchased this radio for the kitchen.  The time is a little hard to see from a distance.  The sound is good.  We are able to receive most of our FM stations, but do have some static on the AM side. Not a bad radio for the price."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I like this radio a lot. Between the solid tuning, the preset buttons and pretty decent sound for the size, there's a lot to like. However, the way the sleep timer is set up is idiotic. I use the sleep timer a lot, and while this is not a deal breaker, it does make it lose a star for me.\n\nReview updated to note that I am having the same problem now that some previous customers mentioned. The power button, which is also the sleep timer button, is no longer working properly. It can take several presses and wiggles of the button to turn the radio on or off, and the sleep timer (which requires the button to be pressed and held) hardly ever works any more. This is ridiculous. I can no longer use the sleep timer, due to the concern that the power button will fail completely. I'm sending a message to the seller, but I don't have much hope for a positive resolution. If there is a replacement, I will update this review again.\n\nThe seller referred me to Sangean. Sangean did not respond to several emails\/contacts via their website. I called the phone number also given by the seller, which surprisingly connected me to a person at Sangean. The ripoff is that they want you to ship the radio to them, and send them a check for $8 to send it back to you. Between all of those shipping charges, that's half the cost of the radio. I am starting to think that I may be better off not sinking more money into a radio that has major design flaws."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is the best clock radio I ever owned. The sound and radio reception, both AM and FM, are excellent.\nProblem with these type of Alarm clock Radios, are the instructions. They are difficult to understand, as each button used in setting up and making changes to the settings have to follow a proper sequence, pressing once or holding for 2 seconds. The display panel can be of great help, but image of it included in the instructions, need improvement. The instructions could also be written in a simpler manner.\nI must complement Sangean's customer\/technical service representative who was very knowledgeable answering the questions I had.\nHighly recommended.\nAdded 12\/25\/16 Best feature of the clock is the progressive increase in the volume of the radio as it sounds in alarm mode. You never get jarred out of your sleep."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The radio has a good sound, and the preset station buttons are great because I listen to three different stations at different times of the day."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is the BEST clock radio I have ever owned and I have had quite a few.  The sound is excellent, programming is easy, nice and compact.  I love it!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The clock radio is fine, the speaker tones are great and that is what I wanted.  The only issue is that the lettering for the clock is hard to read because they are not very pronounced."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: As advertised, and works great...with two exceptions.....Snooze alarm is set at a fixed 5-min interval...Really? That's not a 'snooze'....that's a 'blink'...\nAnd, it seems to be stuck on February....no matter what I change, it's February.....What this means is that I need to set both alarms the same, or, during the week, I wake up late, or vice versa, as it's always got the wrong day of the week showing.....\nMinor inconvenience, and other than that, I like it....decent value...."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: My very old Sony dream clock radio died and I spent a ridiculous amount of time attempting to find a replacement.  I read so many reviews from various websites and decided on this Sangean.  I wanted good reception, preset stations, dual alarms - this has all that.  I live in a rural area, can't sleep at night and rely on the radio as my distraction.  I can pull in major stations 150 to 200 miles away at night sometimes farther.  I read a review about the difficulty in using this - I don't it much different than my 15 year old Sony or even programming the answering machine.  One uses the same button for multiple things however I don't find this any more difficult than anything made today that does more than one function.  I did not buy it from Amazon because I wanted to be able to return it easily if the reception was poor so picked it up for close to the same price at a dreaded large retailer.  I'm sure I could have spent over $100 on a new radio but after reading so many reviews it didn't seem that I would improve much on this affordable alternative.  I would recommend this and at the price it's a pretty good deal."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The speaker on this is just terrible and sound comes with constant static. All stations sound bad and we live in an area with fine FM radio reception.  Even the aux connection sounds muffled.  I wish we tested this before the return date.  Will simply have to throw it away."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It does what a radio should do, holding the station without drifting and producing okay sound. The buttons on the top are tiny and the procedures for setting the time or an alarm are absolutely confusing.  I have it in the kitchen where I use the clock and listen to one station, and it works fine for that limited purpose."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I got a defective one. When I set the alarm to go off on radio, sometimes it goes off on the beep. Very annoying. The first time it happened I double checked that I had it set to radio properly, and I had. Then it happened again 2 other times in the same week. I'm returning this.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because other than the problem of not being able to wake up to the radio (which is why I got this in the first place), I rather like this alarm clock. I'd normally give it 3 or 4 stars if it worked properly. The sound is ok but not nearly as great as everyone in the reviews are saying, and the feature to have it go off on certain days of the week is really neat. It feels cheaper than what it should for the price though, it is light and made of shiny plastic that feels cheap. I was disappointed when I opened the box and saw this, I expected better for build quality.\n\nAll in all a nice alarm if it were half the price and weren't defective."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Fantastic.  Catches a radio signal very well, which is hard at our house.  I like that it can dial up the stations by half increments if you choose.  Love all the features especially the crescendo alarm.  If I'm listening to the radio as I lay in bed, the alarm still goes off, but softly, then gets louder to wake me up.  I also like that it doesn't jar me awake.  Only thing it's missing is a snooze bar, but maybe that's a good thing!  You need the instruction manual for the first day to catch all the features, but it will be intuitive after that.  Also really like the disable display that doesn't keep me awake."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Good sound. Looks solidly built. My only gripe is turning on or off the alarm. As other reviewers have commented, Sangean definitely over engineered that aspect. It could have definitely been more simplied. After all, sometimes it's about the keystrokes."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I needed to replace my 30 year old Proton 320, and Sangean was highly recommended.  The unit is small but mighty.  I had a question about the alarm programming and wrote to the supplier, but they were completely unable to help.  I called Sangean and got immediate assistance."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I'm very happy with the radio.  I bought it to replace a Boston Acoustics Receptor radio which was losing its FM capability.  The sound quality of this radio is excellent, especially considering its size.  I really appreciate the humane alarm feature.  The only downside for me is the radio's small size. I have some difficulty in reading the alarm symbols. I didn't have any problem figuring out the instructions like some others.  The instructions are a little complex, but the radio has a lot of features in a small package.  Overall, a very good buy."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: THIS IS A WONDERFUL ALARM CLOCK RADIO! EVERYTHING THAT SANGEAN ADVERTISED IS TRUE. ONLY THING IS THAT THE SOUND QUALITY IS JUST OK TO ME. HENCE, 4-STAR RATING."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Second one I bought.  Have one in the bathroom for morning prep and one in my workshop for \"company\" while I'm working.  Able to play all my iPhone songs through this speaker with \"Aux In\" connection and get my favorite local am\/fm stations."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: Returned this product immediately. Couldn't see the display at night. The radio which was set for 7:10 am didn't come on. The present stations didn't work properly."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: Worked great for two months and then radio started humming and lost all AM and FM stations for hours. After a while it worked again but problem recurs every night.  The warranty requires me to send the radio back ($12 USPS) and enclose a check for $8 for their shipping.  Seems like within a year they should pay for all shipping.  As a result I won't be buying any more Sangean products."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Complicated and irritating.  If you want the alarm on Monday to Saturday, and off on a Sunday....I see no option.  Without a major production.  It's just a real hassle in general.  Also, there is some weird humming noise that comes & goes.  the light also comes & goes if I am holding it to set it and sometimes this \"E\" comes up.  so I don't know what's going on here, but I followed all the directions. It's very nice looking & the sound from the radio is outstanding, BUT it's just too much work & it is not user friendly.  I'll probably return this."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio is perfect.  I wanted a small table radio that I could us in the living room.  I wanted one that had buttons on it for switching stations, not the knob that makes it difficult to search for programs.  This one fit the bill.  I had ordered and returned 2 others but this is a keeper.  The sound quality is pretty good for such a small radio."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I've heard a lot of good things about Sangean audio. I ordered this one since it looked like a nice simple alarm clock radio with decent sound for a small box. It was a bit complicated to program the alarms and all but the big problem was the radio alarm would not play when set up for radio. I'm pretty tech savvy and I know I was doing it right. It was a glitch and, searching the reviews here, it seems to be pretty common.\nThat's too bad because Sangean won't be in this household for a very long time."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Really like the features. I like the sleep timer for the radio. Has jack for headsets. 5 stations for radio presets for each AM and FM channels.\nReception on radio stations came in really good."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: In 1993 I bought my last decent clock radio.  It didn't seem like anything special until it finally died last year and I went to replace it.  What a sea of obtuse junk I had to wade through!  Non intuitive button layout is the new normal. Digital tuning is now surprisingly rare when it seemed standard 20 years ago. What a leap backwards.\n\nI never heard of Sangean until Amazon searching brought me to several products including the RCR-5.  Now I've had it for almost a year.  It reminds me of my 1993 Sony but brought into the modern era, which is what I hoped for all along. (The sound, though, is more than a little improved.)\n\nI like it.  I'd buy it again. With luck, I won't have to revisit the decision until the 2030s.\n\nThere are a few fiddly things related to time and alarm setting they could make simpler.  Beyond that I have no complaints."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Works well but. Overlooked that it can't be set for 6 days Eg Mon-Sat or select days individually days that can be can be repeated. The Sony it's replacing you could choose any combination of days Eg Mon,Wed,Fri & Sat. Or Mon, Tue, Wed, Thurs, Sun.  As you can do with a cell phone."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is at least the 6th clock radio I've ordered from Amazon.  I'm sorry to say this but they're all garbage.  I thought if I spent a little more on this Sangean I might luck out.  Wrong.  The setup is a joke.  There are about six steps involved.  Believe it or not, you have to go through all the steps with no hesitation; you can't take too much time at any of the steps or you lose all the previous settings and have to start over again.  At the stage for \"frequency\" (you can set the alarm for a certain day) pressing the +\/- bar does nothing.  You have to go through all this just to set the AM.  What is it with these manufacturers?  All the reviews for clock radios of every company complain about the same things.  You can't do a setup.  If you do a setup it doesn't hold and loses minutes (often right out of the box).  There are too many buttons.  The buttons are too small with script that's also so small you can't even read them.  If anyone out there is listening, these things are not the Mars Rover or IBM's Watson; they're CLOCK RADIOS!  There's a reason the old Sony Dream Machines (now discontinued) are on sale by some retailers for over $100.  They do what they're supposed to do.  Easy setup, accessible interface and decent sound quality.  How about a simple switch to change from AM to FM?  God save us from smart machines that outsmart themselves and make fools out of customers.  (I gave this unit two stars because the sound quality was above average)."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this as a replacement for a replacement of my old Sony Dream Machine Cube that I owned for 20+ years. It was sturdy, ergonomic, and it had a wonderful radio unit. The first replacement I bought was what now passes as a Sony cube (~$20 Amazon), made in China, which is a complete piece of garbage. Ignore the positive reviews as they have been written by people who never saw a real Sony in their life. It truly stinks: cheap plastic, sharp edges, shoddy construction, crappy radio receiver, etc. I must have been mad to think that anything of the old Sony quality was available at a similar price.\n\nActually the old Sony Cube design now sells upwards of $100 bucks. I night have sprung for it, but I wanted to check the competition first and see if I could save some dough. $100 for a clock-radio is nuts.\n\nThe Sangean turned out to provide excellent value for the money.($35 at the time of this writing.) The manufacturing is great---sturdy, tight chassis,  excellent receiver, golden light with adjustable brightness, AM-FM with Seek or pre-sets, auxiliary and headphone jacks, nap timer, easy-to-read numbers, two alarms...\n\nThe radio sound doesn't have that low-end tinny clock-radio sound. Reminds me of the table radio I had in high-school. Not content to leave well enough alone, the government has made some new AM regulations that affect the Am band sound, but the attached antenna does a great job of hiding them. (You might have reception problems way out in the boonies; otherwise it should be fine.)\n\nThe curved edges make it comfortable to cuddle up to in bed, which is one thing I alway enjoyed about the Sony. I hate using headphones when I'm going to sleep."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Its a good enough clock radio, it has the headphone jack I needed, but the LCD dis0play is too small and not bright enough for me to se with my impaired vision."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Best clock radio I've ever had. Multiple alarms are great. No need to turn alarm off for the weekend, just set m-f once and never messed with it again. Radio sounds good, starts off low  then volume goes up."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am VERY happy with this alarm clock radio!  Overall the size is just right: small enough to fit on my nightstand, large enough to accommodate the display and necessary buttons.  The orange-ish backlight is easy on the eyes at night, and easy to see during the day.  It features digital tuning, and you can pre-set 5 different radio stations.  I found it very easy to program the alarms: sure it requires pressing the appropriate button multiple times, but lots of electronics make you do that.  One of the nice things about the alarms (you can set two different alarm times) is that you can schedule the alarm to go off only once, only Monday-Friday, or only on the weekend.  And I really love the \"humane waking\" feature, where the alarm comes on softly at first and then gradually increases to your preset volume, so you don't get blasted out of bed.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend, and would definitely buy this item again."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Nice clock radio, small, fits on nightstand well.  I don't like the interference on the am band.  This was discussed in the manual and if I had known it I wouldn't have purchased it as I like to listen to AM.  Lou"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent small\/normal size clock radio.  The sound is remarkable for the unit's size and the digits of the time display are about 5\/8\" high which I can see without my eyeglasses at night.  I like that this unit knows the date so my alarm can be set for Monday-Friday and not weekends.  I'd heard about Sangean before, but now I own one and can say that all the info about their superior radio\/speaker is true.  This unit replaced one double the width, depth and height and yet it sounds better!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Still haven't got the hang of setting the alarms.  Also can't figure out how to set the sleep timer for the radio.  Maybe it's just me, but even after following the instructions, I'm not where I should be!  Maybe I should have bought a clock radio with less bells & whistles.  Radio reception is excellent."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Only a couple niggling problems - it's too easy to set \"nap\" when I'm trying to hit something else, and even on the dimmest setting it could bother your sleep if you like sleeping in a very, very dark room."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Kind of small, but otherwise works well.  One weird thing is that knob for adjustment of illumination is on bottom, so can't change it easily from lights out to daylight."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is the best alarm clock I've owned.  I bought this one because of its digital tuner and sound quality (I use it as a radio too).  The buttons are solid and the sound quality actually is good.  The volume is digitally controlled which is nice, no more accidentally turning the wrong one and waking up to static.  The presets are very easy to set and use, I've never owned a clock with this feature and I probably won't own one without it again.  There is an aux-in as well (3.5mm), I never really use those though so I haven't tested it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Needed a new alarm clock because my 25+ year old one only got one radio station and I didn't always want to listen to that station's morning show when I woke up. Decided the new radio had to have a digital tuner and multiple alarms. This clock fits the bill. Takes a little while to set the alarm timer, but its not difficult - you are setting more than just time, you're also setting day and radio station. Being able to set different stations to different alarms is a nice feature. You can also set it to just turn on the radio without the alarm (which sounds like a truck backing up). Now my only problem is that I have found out that early morning radio in my town sucks and I'm still waking to the same station. :-)"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Overall I'm happy with this clock radio. The sound quality is quite good for this little box and I love the gradual volume increase. Features I would improve upon are a more intuitive design for setting the alarm, and an easier or automatic adjustment of the brightness of the readout. I have it set very dim for nighttime, but that means I can barely read it during the day."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: (1) Be forewarned. An insert in the box -- which is not in Amazon's description -- says \"VERY IMPORTANT PLEASE READ. Sangean suggests that you keep the AC Adapter at least 12 inches away from the radio while listening to the AM band. Your Sangean radio is powered by an AC adapter which is a 'switching' or 'switch-mode' type. The DOE (Dept of Energy) has a Federal mandate requiring all manufactures to use this type of power supply. This newer power saving technology has the unfortunate side effect of causing interference to the AM radio band.\" As it turns out, I need the adapter to be within 12\" of the radio. Amazon should include this in the item's description.\n[...]\n\n(2) I don't know if it is because of where I live (suburb) or the radio itself, but the reception I got on both AM and FM was poor. Only a couple stations came in strongly. Therefore, I cannot rate this radio more than two stars ** (below average).\n\nSo, for both reasons, the same day I received the radio, I am returning it to Amazon for full refund. My verdict: Thumbs down -- this radio is not a keeper."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: most features are as expected but the AM reception doesn't measure up to my other radios of similar quality.  Like the headphone jack so my wife can listen to music while I snore (my bruised ribs are starting to heal)."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am so disappointed with this clock radio. It had the potential to be fantastic. But, it doesn't have a battery backup. So, every time the electricity goes out (which happens at an alarming rate at my house) I have to not only re-set the time but all the memory pre-sets as well! So, I'm giving it away. The radio gets pretty good reception. But it's just not worth the hassle of no battery backup."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Gets better reception than old one. Missing daily used function of sleep mode, where radio would go off at set time. Simple function that should be included."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: After living with it's eccentricities for 60 days, I've grown to hate it. It just is so badly designed. Grrr. My earlier review is below, but the difficulty of programming the alarm, the difficulty of turn it on and off for just one day, and the need to constantly reprogram it (as opposed to leaving one time in place, but turning on that time only when I need the alarm have made me hate it.\n\nHere is my earlier review:\n\nIt's a good radio with three oddities that really knock it down from from being a five star product.\n\nFirst a clock radio, especially an expensive one like that one that doesn't come with a battery backup in 2016 is an embarrassment. This has a 10-minute backup, which is ridiculous.\n\nThen the user manual isn't written well and the icons, especially the ones identifying the buttons are in such tiny type they are nearly unreadable.\n\nBut the real oddity is the way the alarm gets set.\n\nSetting the alarm is really easy if you want to set it for a regular schedule. It can be set to go off every day, or weekdays only, or weekends only.\n\nBut it's very odd if you want to just use the alarm occasionally or skip a day.\n\nIf you do that, the clock radio doesn't retain the last alarm time. It defaults to 6 a.m. and you constantly have to reset the alarm.\n\nSo if you have a day off or a holiday and turn off the alarm, you have to totally reset the alarm the next time you use it. It's not a good design for any alarm clock. It's especially bad for an alarm clock with two alarms. If you set one alarm for music wakeup and another for a buzzer wakeup, they both have to be reset each time.\n\nAt least that is what the instructions say. It's not very clear.\n\nIt's not very user friendly. ."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I live in the country that has poor poor reception. I thought I would be able to get reception in there from the reviews I read. Still can't get good reception. Took it to my job and it worked intermittently. Got so disgusted, gave it away."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Nice size.  A little tricky to set, but it helps to read the instructions.  lol.  My only true complaint is that the On\/Off button is in the second row.  I would have put it in front, as the most accessible spot.  It is lighted, though that doesn't help when I'm just \"feeling\" for the button.\nSound is good.  Plugging my phone in the same outlet does not affect the sound, as in my last clock.radio."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Cannot figure out how to set the alarms.  Read the instructions; too hard to work the buttons; is this made in China?\nThe back lite is too bright to be able to read the time from an real distance.  I regret buying this product.  I want one that was digital music dial and that is what led me to this choice."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was hesitant to buy a new clock since I'd had my current one for 30 years.  I ended up needing a dual alarm with a short snooze (this one is set at 5 min which is what I wanted).  I'm getting used to the backlit display  -  great graduated control over brightness so you can make it nearly off.  It was easy to set up and easy to use."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is just an average radio alarm clock. The radio reception is the same as any average radio, meaning that high output stations come in great but small or moderate output stations are plagued with static. I'm now thinking a WiFi radio would be a better choice.\n  The alarm feature is complicated and the settings are too small in size. The dial background is light yellow with black numerals, it's hard to read in comparison to my Sony with big red numerals. If you need reading glasses don't  buy this unit, you have to use them to read the alarm settings. On a positive note the presets are nice"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Crystal clear reception, even for some far-away stations, and nice sound quality.\n\nThe options for alarms (e.g. weekday only, choose station and volume) are fantastic."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great little clock radio. fairly easy to programme etc and good sound.\nMy last radio had a remote which was very handy, this would be perfect if this could be  added."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The clock would not keep time. It was nearly eight seconds fast per minute. I sat there with a stopwatch and it took 52 seconds for the minute to change on the display. After about an hour it would be about 15 minutes fast. What good is a clock radio if the clock doesn't work?"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Like: Nice size, good sound. Attractive design; not too many tiny buttons. Two alarms can be set.\nDon't like: Sleep timer is maximum 60 minutes. Display is not dimmable and is fairly bright at night. Buttons should be backlit. Manual appears to be written with Google Translate."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I like all of the features. Nice orange color LCD. Adjustable brightness. Has a gentle wake option (music starts at low volume and then increases gradually).\nI do not like the buttons. They are all the same shape and size (except for snooze). I contrast this with my old Sony which had different shaped buttons for each function. With the Sony, I could do what I needed to do just by touch. With the Sangean, I need to create a mental map of the layout so there has been a steep learning curve. I've had to turn on a light to see buttons too many times.\nI like the volume control. It has detents (clicks) so my cat is unable to adjust the volume. :-)\nFinally, setup for this clock REQUIRES READING THE MANUAL. I'm a very tech person but this radio would be impossible to set up without the manual."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: what i wanted..\nnumbers are easy to read.. don't much care for the yellowish hue of the backlight.. but its in the pic.. and what I expected.\nbuttons are easy to use.. easy to read directions.. easy to set up\nA plus it has 1\/10 increments on the radio dial\nI gave it a four not because of any performance issue... but just things I would like to be different.\nI would like a tone control.. its a little bassy for my bad ears\nbacklight hue would be nicer not so lit up.. its a large yellowish display... but again its in the pic\nI would like a removable backup battery for power outages.\nAn internal FM antenna would be nice to eliminate yet another cord or have the cord removable\nI would buy it again.. simple clock radios are difficult to come by. I don't need all the bells and whistles\nnow if they would just start making manual wind alarms and watches again...."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This clock radio has a very good radio that picks up stations the Sony that it replaced could not get clearly. The sound quality is also good for a clock radio. I like the digital tuning and the memories, and I like how the alarm starts soft and gradually grows louder. It gently wakes you up without startling you.\n\nThere are two minor drawbacks that I've experienced, the first being the display, which is very bright. I prefer the green on black numbers on the Sony. The second problem is that setting the alarm is complicated. My wife is not confident on how to do it, so I have to set it for her."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Outstanding item! I got this for my 90 year old father to replace his older radio. He keeps thanking me as I think he got used to cheap radios. This is easy to use, very well made, excellent signal to noise ratio. He plugs in his headset and we can even dial the brightness of the display easily."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: used just to listen to the radio with headphones at work. it was difficult to find a radio that wasn't too expensive but had the option of plugging in headphones and this was my best option and not too badly priced"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought two.  I loved them, so year later, I bought two more, and they had improved them!  My only quibble is that I wish they came in other colors."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Bought this for my 80+ year old mother.\nTook a long time to learn how to set it up - the manual was very difficult to follow.\nVery stable (as her prior radio used to drift off station - this one always stays locked), and good reception of local stations.\nI had thought it was an atomic clock-radio as many Sangean models are I think - but it is not. Stays set fairly well - rarely need to reset unless we have a long, day+ power failure."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: It is hard for me to figure out how to set the alarms. Simple clock radio ought to be easy to set up and us."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Can't say enough good about this radio except I ordered a second one the next day after I received the first and heard the sound and ease of programming. Brings in stations without static or drift that was impossible with other radios. Love the push buttons to quickly change from one station to another just like in a car."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Don't bother!  Had the radio for 6 months now. Radio stations no longer come in, alarm is difficult to set, and the alarm goes off at random times when not even set!  Contacted the manufacturer and had the worst customer service!  Save your money and don't buy."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: So far so good! My really likes this as this was our 5th clock radio. She'd \"love\" it if it came in something other than black or white but so far it's a good clock with a good radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Little backup when a power outage occurs.  The only thing saved is the station frequency -- no clock, no time off and on. If I were using this as a wake-up alarm it would be a good boat anchor.  Also, it is hard to program."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Difficult to follow setting instructions written by someone for whom English is a second language.\nIn a power failure all info disappears when power comes back on (like the time). My old clock retained that info.\nI like the size for a night stand. I like that you can turn the sound way down while trying to go to sleep.\nAfter 6 months I still have trouble setting the alarm. I use my phone instead."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I replaced my previous Sangean radio with this model.  While I loved my previous radio, for some reason the alarm function ceased to function after a few years.  The Sangean products seem to be well made and function just fine; I just hope I will not run into a similar problem with this new purchase."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It's a nice radio but not exceptional. The radio section is easy to operate and almost intuitive, not so for the clock\/alarm section which is a little more difficult to set. It does not have a true battery backup, the backup time of 10 minutes is really insufficient. Music sounds decent but talk from the single speaker has the typical \"boomy\" sound of most small AC radios. There are no tone controls. FM reception is good. I live in an urban area. When you switch bands to AM the volume drops very noticeably even on a strong station you will need to turn up the volume. AM reception is acceptable and inline with most AM radios. It seems to hold station very well. Signal sensitivity is average. It comes with a 6VDC wall wart and a note not to place the radio too close to the switching supply to avoid interference on AM. Claims the switching supply is mandated by the FCC. The radio is sensitive to noise produced by the OSRAM 40\/60W LED bulbs sold at BIG BOX stores, especially on weak stations. Also most, but not all, electronic ballasts on fluorescent lamps will screw up AM reception also, big time. Maybe the FCC should mandate something about this rather than telling manufacturers to save a 1\/4 watt of power. The AM antenna is internal, so for best reception you need to move\/turn the radio, hopefully you can still see the clock after this is done. The FM antenna is a two foot wire hanging out the back. Some radios use the AC cord for the FM antenna, this separates the two, probably the better solution. I ran my antenna under a place mat with a right angle bend. Seems to work without having to move it around and the antenna is invisible and out of the way. The 10 preset stations are nice and the reason I bought the radio. The display brightness is controlled by a trim pot on the bottom and works well, No more radio nightlights for me. Basically I am happy with the purchase. Keep the manual in the nightstand drawer for those times when 10 minutes is not sufficient."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Reception on the radio is poor, which is surprising considering it's a Sangean. Has a few feet long antenna in the form of a wire that appears ineffective. I've tried hanging it on walls, wiring another wire onto it, but it's just bad reception. Battery backup is atrocious. If your power goes out for more than 10 minutes........that's right, 10 minutes, the clock resets and loses the time. It does not automatically set the time when you plug it in or when it recovers from a power outage. You have to manually do it, and this is about the most unintuitive machine I've ever dealt with. Difficult to set the alarm, or the time. Radio is easy to use, but basically non-functional as a result of the poor reception.\n\nOn the bright side, it's pretty, and I like the display. Appears well put together, very solid. If you get reception, then the speaker is a joy to hear. However, as a result of the problems above, I switched back to my old RCA clock radio, which gets better reception. I drift off to BBC news on NPR during the overnight hours so the radio is a must."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a great choice for a full feature clock radio.  I researched and chose it primarily because if offers infinitely adjustable screen brightness.  This was important to me to find a right compromise for day and night viewing.  This product delivers.  Most other clock radios only offer a high\/low switch.  This is not nearly enough for me.  Also great is the \"humane wake system\" which gradually increases alarm or radio volume from zero to your max preset  volume.  Very pleasant to wake to after years of being jarred awake by my last product.  Radio sound quality is very good and reception strength is excellent:  able to pull-in weak stations.  Some have criticized the difficulty of setting the alarms.  There are several keystrokes necessary but if you bother to read the manual (a radical idea for some!) it is quite logical and not really a burden considering all the options available to you.  A lot of performance at a reasonable price!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: A really good clock radio.  Love that it comes on quiet, either radio or chime, and gets louder.  Excellent time display with adjustable brightness.  Easy alarm settings for M-F, weekend only, single day.  Remembers last setting if you disable alarm for day off and then need to reset alarm on. Most important for me -- radio volume goes very low to loud.  I tried another popular clock radio (with time projection, which is nice), but the lowest setting of 1 was waaaay too loud.  The Sangean is perfect.  Snooze is only 5 min, not the standard 9.  Looks smart on the nightstand."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: It's a little complicated to set the alarms, but the radio works well.  It remembers settings, so if you listen to a different station or change the volume some time during the day,  it will remember the station and volume you selected for waking up in the morning."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a great radio with lots of features.  I really like it except for one thing:  the buttons are all identical (except for the snooze) and are lined up in a straight row.  This means that you have to be sure which button your finger is on before pushing it.  I wish they would have varied the size\/position a bit.  Still, its a minor annoyance compared to the features of the radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I was looking for a clock radio that had an earphone jack.  This has that, and good sound quality, as well as preset stations and a nice appearance.  My only comment is.... when using the headphone jack, the speakers are disabled, even for the alarm. I would think that there should be some provision to make the alarm audible to waken the sleeper!  I do like the radio in spite of this.  You won't go wrong with it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The orange backlight is okay, but I think I prefer other types of digital clock displays.  Otherwise, it's a very good product, easy to setup."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I live between two major cities, Los Angeles and San Diego, and have had ongoing reception difficulties with clock radios. I have gone through probably a half dozen clock radios trying to find one that had the ability to receive either city's radio stations clearly. I like to listen to music in the morning when I'm getting ready for the day and every clock radio I had ever tried had major difficulties pulling in LA and\/or San Diego stations. Even moving my curling iron from one spot to another in the bathroom would cause the reception to fade in and out. If I moved away from the radio, the reception faded. This radio rocks! Not only does it pull in LA and San Diego stations clearly, but it has 5 programmable stations, so when the station goes to music I don't like or a commercial (or blathering DJs), I just punch a button and happiness reins again. Love it!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Good sounding alarm clock radio. I like to listen to the radio when I go to bed, but my wife doesn't.  This is the solution I was looking for.  I purchased this because of the head phone jack.  There are plenty of AM\/FM clock radio's on the market that will outperform this one.  If you don't need the aux out, buy something else."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Radio works fine. Nice small size.  But alarm is a problem. No matter whether set to come on as radio or alarm, 9 out of 10 times it comes on as alarm. And the alarm comes on at random times when not set.  Returned both radios."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Purchased this because I wanted a clock radio that had good reception and this is terrific.  The houses in our neighborhood were built 100+ years ago at the bottom of an old quarry.  So we have stone bluffs to the west and north of us - making radio and TV reception awful.  This radio has digital tuning and I am able to clearly receive signals for five of my favorite stations, including one independent low power station.  And reception is still good after my naughty cat chewed on the thin wire antenna taking off a good 12\" of its length.  And yes, the alarms work well, too.  Appreciate that the volume on them starts low and slowly increases.  Nicer way to start the day.  So happy with this purchase!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Love the Sangean products. Bought this because of earphone output which allowed for a pillow speaker (also Sangaen). Easy set up, light in front is adjustable, and buttons make it easy to use at night. Also, nice and compact."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Was advertised as have clean, clear reception in AM. Maybe it is the area where I live but the reception had lost of static and humming so I returned it."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: It arrived in early December of 2015. It died in late April of 2016, no power. It did what it was supposed to do - tell time and make sounds, until it stopped working. Very disappointed."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Radio works well and I like the (5) presets per band.  Small profile works very well.  Only possible improvement is a battery backup for power outages."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Best feature - alarm can be set for specific days of week.  It alarms Monday-Friday, and I don't have to turn the alarm off for the weekend.  Also like the way the alarm remembers the alarm station and volume setting, so can fall asleep to one station at night and wake to another, louder, in the morning.  Good sound quality too for a radio this size.\n\nOne quibble - why bother displaying seconds?"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I had been looking for a clock radio for a while now, and I noticed that the quality of clock radio's (without built-in cd players or iphone chargers) has decreased significantly since the late 90s or so. I stumbled across this particular clock being reviewed on Youtube, and decided to give it a shot. It is a bit pricier than I was expecting, but then again, since it seems clock radio's are more of a niche item these days, I guess that's understandable. I picked up the clock through warehouse deals, but having used it for the past few weeks, I would gladly pay Amazon's asking price for a new unopened box. The FM radio has decent reception, though it is sometimes disrupted if I place my phone near the clock. I only really listen to one station on AM for weather, and that station has good reception. I found the clock very intuitive to set up, but if you're a technophobe I can see how setting the alarms for the first time may be confusing. Once you get used to it though, not a problem at all. The best feature IMO is being able to set the volume at which the alarm comes on (for both the buzzer and the radio), independent of the volume at which the radio is last played. There's even an auxiliary device input, in case you want to connect your mp3 player, and use that as your alarm. Finally, I wasn't really looking for sound quality in an alarm clock, but I must say that the quality is much better than I would have expected from a clock radio. If you need a clock radio, look no further, it doesn't get much better than this for under  fifty bucks."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I am unable to set the clock appropriately. I wish to return it. The clock feature and timer feature do not coordinate. The settings for stations work well."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Brought for better reception,  but it was worse than 20 year old radio we had. Otherwise it was a good product.  That sounds sarcastic, but the two stations it did receive sounded much better than our old radio."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: The Sangean RCR-5 clock radio has excellent reception and sound.  Actually, its pretty amazing for a clock radio.  It has 5 AM and 5 FM presets, and a light brightness dial, which is located on the bottom of the unit.  There are two alarms that can be programmed independently of each other.\n\nI did not find this hard at all to program.  Since its so flexible, the alarm process does need to go thru its options to program to your likingshour, minute, awake alarm (buzzer or radio), band (if radio), station (if radio), alarm volume (yes, you can set the volume of the alarm separately from your last listening volume).  The radio automatically takes you to the next step that you need to answer.  Plus, it remembers your previous answers.  So, if you're one who only changes the time to wake, you basically hit the next, next, next button to program the alarm, only changing the time.  Both the buzzer and the radio start softly and get louder (HWS).\n\nBesides setting the alarm for one time, you can also set it for weekday, weekend, and all days.  There is a nap and a sleep function, both time programmable.  The snooze function is 5 minutes per snooze and not time programmable.\n\nI did have an issue:  I programmed for the radio to play on wake and the buzzer went off instead.  I called Sangean and spoke with a very knowledgeable tech, Bob, who explained that if the radio station reception is considered too weak, the buzzer would go off instead.  In my case, this was exactly what happened, even though *I* didn't think the station was weak."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: **Great Quality Product!!  Able to finally receive FM stations clearly, which I could never get in my room, Set the FM and AM pre-sets.  My hats off to Sangean America Inc., Would absolutely recommend, especially at the price-point..."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: The one serious drawback: it does not like LED bulbs. Turning the light on a bedside night table iinterferes with reception and drops the volume by about a third. Otherwise an excellent little alarm clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was so frustrated with my old Sony clock radio. With the manual tuning, I could only pick up about two stations and I live in a large metro area. I researched a lot of radios to make sure the one I was getting had a better tuner. Other radios said they had a great tuner but VERY complicated in setting up the alarms and time. I got my Sangean today and had it completely set up with station presets and two different alarms within 10 minutes. Very easy to operate and the digital tuning is excellent. I now can pick up stations that I never could with the Sony. I probably would give it 5 stars but I just got it today."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Use this in the kitchen and it works well . I also like that I can connect my iPod to it to listen to music. Nice radio all in all!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The radio is all I expected. I especially like the ability to push a button to find a station rather than fiddle with a knob."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent product. Very well designed easy to use and adjust. Radio is of good quality. I recommend this as a gift or for yourself. The alarm is really cool!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Having read the other reviews, I wasn't sure about ordering this radio. I followed the advise of others and took many pictures of the packaging, etc..\nThis radio is okay. The sound quality is not the best and setting it up does take some time but for the price, it is good."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very happy with this radio. It's attractive, good sound and multiple options. Most importantly for me, the digital display is large, but the lighting is not disturbing."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I like this clock radio except for a major shortcoming: setting the alarms is too complicated!  You almost need a computer science degree to program it!  I find the overall build quality to be quite good. The sound quality of the radio is quite good for a clock radio most  have a thin, tinny sound while the sound from the Sangean is full bodied."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I bought this radio because it was supposed to lock in hard to get AM signals. The radio I was going to replace this with was getting scratchy signals at night. Well, this is by far a much worse radio than the one I was going to replace it with. This radio gets NO signal on hard to get stations, nothing, just major static.  I am so tired of being lured into products that promise one thing... and that is the one thing their product does not do. Also, it has an AC adapter and very thin cord that is flimsy at best and is supposed to be some kind of energy saving adapter. I really want to return this radio and I suggest if you are looking for an AM radio for night listening this is not it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Arrived when promised.  Very happy with it so far.  Was looking for a alarm clock radio with a headphone jack.  Not many are made with one any more.  My old radio had trouble pulling in one of my favorite stations, this radio had no problem."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a fantastic clock radio. The digital radio is easy to use, very crisp and clear, no station drift with a nice sound.  The dual alarm is nice and I especially like the sleep timer.  One of the best features is that you can lighten or dim the display with a simple button on the bottom of the clock radio.  I wanted a well built, dependable clock radio and this certainly fit the bill. I highly recommend this product."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Bought because of the \"Sleep\" feature - to listen and fall asleep to a particular station at night.\nThe contrast between the numbers and the background is very low, with my -3 vision I cannot see them if I wake up.\n\nEasy to mix up the nap and the sleep features which means you will be woken up by a loud sound just as you've fallen asleep.\n\nAntenna is quite good."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Very complicated to set up. Stopped working 32 days after it arrived. Return policy said it was too late to return it, but Amazon made it right!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: So far, so good. I like the weekday\/weekend options for alarms. It's is quite a process to set and reset, and very strange that the battery back-up doesn't keep the time for more than a few minutes but it turns out it did keep the alarm setting (although I didn't know it until I had gone through several steps of the setup). Good dimmer and display, don't need the seconds so that's just one more step you have to do and how do I find the correct \"second\" we're at anyway?"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: We got a black one of these in December and the clock didn't work (couldn't set it). We sent that one back and the new one seemed fine for a while until we realized that it was losing 1 minute per day, so every few days we'd have to fix the time on it. It is supposed to have some kind of satellite that adjusts the clock, but it doesn't seem to work properly. By the time we realized this, it was too late to return it to Amazon. Now Sangean wants us to pay them to ship it back to them and diagnose the problem and then they will decide if they want to fix it or give us a new one. At this point we don't want a new one!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Just what I expected and more.  Sound is very good for its size.  Some practice is needed to set the alarm but nothing I could not accomplish using the manual.  Having a battery backup system, when losing the power in the house, would have been nice but this model does not have it.  10 minute backup system might be enough, will find out.  All in all very happy with the purchase."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I don't know why but I am unable to set the date - when I hit the set time button it reverts back to the time so the day and date are always off.\nAlso I wish I could manually tune in the stations.  Otherwise the clock radio is adequate for my needs so I won't be returning it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Exactly perfect for a person with poor eye sight to use in the kitchen.  Simple to use. Excellent reception.  Very good sound quality.  Buttons have tactile click which is incredibly helpful.  Display and functions are not overly complicated."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love my new alarm clock!  I love that I can dim the display light!  I love the preset stations!  I especially love that it has great reception for radio stations that are quite far away that I never used to be able to listen to!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It functions OK. Would have liked more FM presets. Really don't need the ones for AM.\nThe alarm setup is really quirky. I must have made a slight adjustment, and the #1 alarm switched from radio to the soft alarm, resulting in me waking up later. You essentially have to completely go through the alarm setup again to fix it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I purchased this as a gift for my mother since all the reviews looked like this was some miracle of technology, especially since all the other clock radios made today look so cheap. The radio is OK... but isn't worth the price we paid, not by a long shot."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Programming the alarm was a little more in depth than I would prefer, but it is quite doable. I like the way that the music turns louder slowly in increments so as not to startle you awake. Very happy"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent reception and sound quality. Not simple to work with, wish the lights were in red , not too bright. I am happy with this purchase"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The Sangean RCR-5 radio works out great for me. I strung out the FM antenna wire and taped it under the edge of the kitchen divider in my apartment. Had no problem setting up the memories or the date and time.. FM reception is good. AM reception is susceptible to the usual pickup of appliance noise. However, strong local AM stations are OK.  It's not being used as an alarm clock radio. I have another Sangean for that.\nI have it on the kitchen divider and listen to it in kitchen and dining area. Speaker on top allows good sound from any side."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this radio alarm clock for my husband and he loves it!  Some settings were not intuitive but after he read the instructions, he really loves the unique features this clock offers. Pluses are: infinitely variable background light - from complete black to bright orange, great sound for an alarm clock, can program 2 wake-up schedules - He uses 1 for the work week and the 2nd for each weekend day as desired, No need to reset your clock every night. Can even program the volume of the alarm (or radio) and the alarm starts out really soft and then progressively increases in volume until it then starts changing tone variations to ensure you wake up.  Has easy to find snooze bar but also will turn off for 1 minute if not turned off and then resume a minute later.  Light to turn off is dimly lit so you can see in dark and once pressed lights up the display temporarily showing \"OFF\" and then the time before it dims back down.  Has a sleep feature.  The only con noted is the skinny uncomfortable knob used to adjust the backlight which is inconveniently located underneath the unit."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I wanted a clock radio with good reception and sound quality, a display easy to dim or brighten, and a modest footprint. So I read a lot of Amazon reviews and decided to try the Sangean for reception.  This model fits all my criteria and I love that it starts quietly and slowly gets louder.  The reception is excellent and the calm colored amber light can be dimmed more than my light sensitive eyes require.  No need for the sleep mask now. The speaker jack is a nice bonus as I have a set of speakers positioned on each side of the bed for use with my mp3 player.  Very pleased with this purchase."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Really nice. Other reviews say the display is difficult to read. I don't understand - it's not lighthouse-bright like some clock radio (doesn't light up the room), but it's easy enough to read. I especially like the \"soft on\" feature (when you set wake to alarm, the radio volume ramps up, rather than hitting you full-blast). I also like being able to program 1 radio station to wake me during the week days, and another station for the weekends. Radio reception is EXCELLENT - there's an FM station we like, which fades and drifts badly on 2 other radios, but comes in perfectly on this one."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Good radio. Wonderful\nClock no visibale.\nAlarm difficult to operate. Peoblem to relate on alarm. No baterry back up although in catalog promised 10 min, backup"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I like the radio with digital tuning much better that then trying to dial in a radio station.  When waking up to the radio, the volume gradually increases and this is a nice feature as well.\n\nMy only cons is that I have a hard time reading the time at night ( with my glasses off ) compared to other clock radios that I've owned which had higher contrasts between the numbers and the background."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Highly selective and sensitve tuner great clock radio for the price! This suits all my needs. I use this as a external speaker for my music on my phone\nI especially like the feature where you have the ability to set the volumes at different levels for sleeping and waking up, this is very useful. I highly recommend  this to others."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Okay, but hard to read the display because of golden color(too light) .  Better to get a red, blue or green display to read clock.  Okay."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Plus:  The radio has great sound and all of the mentioned features are very, very good.  Repeat, for a non stereo unit, the sound is very good.\nMinus:  The unit was built for DC and there is a clunker of an adapter to deal with.  For most people, this would not be a problem, but for where I use it I would be happier with a normal AC plug.\nNever heard of this brand, but I think it represents real quality.  I am very happy with the radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this for my wife and she loves it! OK fellas, I also bought other things. She just needed an alarm clock that not only did the alarm during the week but did an alarm differently on the weekends. This works great! Also, has the feature where when the alarm goes off, it starts out softly then get a little louder. Perfect for waking up without wanting to beat the crap out of an alarm. Very happy with this product."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I went out on a limb getting this, and I love it. I will always buy Sangean products when possible from here on out. Love love love this clock. The alarm and radio-alarm options are very nice. I've been needing a gradually louder alarm for 20 years, and finally realized shopping online was better than just buying whatever they had on the shelf at a local store. My only gripes, which are outweighed by the positives, are that my favorite FM station has static half the time (all radios in my house have that problem with that station so...) and when I adjust the display to not too bright at night, it is too dim in the day. I read that in another review and they were right about the display brightness, but since I knew that going into it I forgive the clock. I really just wanted a great alarm and a good enough radio in my bedroom in the morning. It passes with flying colors on those two criteria!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I always keep a clock radio in my bathroom, mainly so I can listen while laying in the tub reading, and to tell what time it is of course. I don't care about alarms so I haven't used them, but otherwise I am very pleased with this product.\n\nI've only had it for 24 hours so things could change, but having a digital tuner is a huge plus, jump between presets with a simple touch of a button. I wish the On\/Off button was different than the rest (it is identical to all the others), and the dial volume control is kind of a hassle (I'd prefer a +\/- bar like for tuning and time setting) but it will work. Aux audio in, and an output jack as well, have not been used yet but you can bet they will. The unit is a little larger than I hoped but I can work around that. The price was right and arrived in 2 days. Easy to set up, and the radio actually works really well, picking up all the stations I prefer here in the general Dallas area.\n\nAll in all, 4 big stars overall. Would buy again for sure."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very happy with this guy. Wish the power cord didn't stick out so far in the back before you can bend it. Functionally it works well and is pretty eassy to get the assorted alarms set up."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I've had this for over a year.  At first I could set the alarm (with difficulty - controls are not intuitive) for weekdays only and for a radio station.  The power went out and it lost its settings.  I have read and reread the instructions but it will only let me set the alarm for the beeping noise (no radio) and every day, not weekdays only.  I travel a lot so I am used to different styles of alarm clocks and have no difficulty figuring out those even without instructions. The only thing I like is that, unlike my old clock radio, this one doesn't \"slip\" off the radio station because it's digital.  The dial is very bright at night even on the dimmest setting.  I'll be replacing this and relegating it to \"radio only\" duty in my office.  Maybe I got a lemon.  I always read other purchasers' reviews before buying and others seem to like this radio alarm clock a lot.  Not me."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Simple set up. Nice wall plug that isn't too big. Sangean RCR-5 is an ease to program -- as I wrote \"simple\". The display is easy on the eyes. What I like is the ability to program wake up alarms for weekdays and weekends. Nice touch. Digital tuning. An FM antenna that can be stretched for better reception. (I left it bundled up on the hope it would receive nearby stations -- it did!)\n\nOverall, easy to use, easy on the eyes and easy on the pocket book."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Looked for a radio that wasn't to pricey, but would have a lot of features I wanted. This has everything I wanted, & it wasn't that expensive; came promptly too. I had no problem; very satisfied with my purchase from this person(s)."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: If you are like most buyers, you have already researched the best alarm clocks, like I did.  Apparently, the market is slim out there for these.  I have tried several, and this one is one of the better ones.  It is easy to program the time, and radio stations.  It sounds pleasant to wake up to with the volume progressively gets louder when it turns on.  The touch and feel have a quality appeal.\n\nPros:\n\n1.  Accurate time and alarm (iHomes I have tried gain time)\n2.  Sufficiently large enough digital display\n3.  Conveniently located on\/off and snooze buttons\n\nCons:\n1.  I would recommend backlit numbers.  They are easier to read, especially when waking up.\n2.  Most people don't know the Sangean brand, so I would recommend more branding.\n3.  I would also recommend pronouncing the size of the On\/Off button, as it would be easier to find by touch."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: What drew me to this clock was the Humane Waking System- what a good idea.  Most alarm clocks scare you awake.  What I like about this clock....The display's brightness is easy to control.  Radio reception is stellar for an alarm clock\/radio.  Of course, the HWS.  It has two alarms.\nWhat I don't like.....It's so complicated to set the alarm! I guess if you always get up at the same time it's no biggie, but it's a pain in the neck if you have to change it often like I do.  The snooze button is only 5 minutes! Yes, 5 minutes!  Sorry I bought it.  The darned thing will probably last forever since it's built so well."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: May 8,2017 Update:\nI use this clock radio every night before bed and it works well.  However, I knocked it down 2 stars because some of the radio preset buttons are not working properly, they either jump to another band or the sleep timer.  1 1\/2 years is too short of a time for this to start malfunctioning. My previous Sony lasted nearly a decade without any trouble. I would buy another brand in the future.\n\nI wanted this particular clock radio for 2 years but waited until my Sony finally broke, and it did.\nThe quality seems good, like I thought it was based on the reviews.  The buttons are spaced out and\nare made to handle constant channel changing.  The amber light is controlled from high to off on the bottom of the unit\n\nThe radio reception is better than my Sony, which is impressive. The clock has daily M-F buzzer along with a weekend buzzer.\nTwo alarm settings.  The alarm sounds better than other sounding ones I've had in the past.\nOverall, it's worth it at this price point.  I just hope it last 15 years like my Sony.\n\nUPDATE: 1\/4\/2017.  Just over 1 year later and this radio still works very well.\nUpdate: 1\/15\/2018: I junked this Sangean and bought a Sony Dream Machine on Amazon model ICF-C707"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I am an AM radio junkie, political talk, sports, weather and old time radio shows are the treasures I search for every night.  I live 50 miles from Chicago and this little radio picks up all my favorite stations.  On the FM band I have found two NPR stations I didn't know existed."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is my fourth Sangean radio in addition to a Sangean weather radio.  They are all different models used for different purposes around the house.  I still have them all and use them daily.  Each one has great sound and performs flawlessly.  Sangean is now my first choice when looking for a radio for my use, or as a gift."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Bought this for my dad who needed a new clock radio. He is 83 so needed something simple and easy to use. This is both and is well made. Also looks nice in his night stand as well."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Excellent radio! The digital tuner provides a crisp FM signal. The ;human wakeup alarm\" is a gentle way to be awaked - no abrupt buzzer or radio - just a slowing increasing volume that eases into your subconscious without triggering an adrenaline spike. Radio replaced a ~30 year set with analog tuning what was never 'quite' on station and had a blaring alarm."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great clock radio.  I was looking for one with an earphone jack to play the radio at night under my pillow.  This is one of the few I have found.  Love it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Easy to set up. I barely referred to the instruction manual.  The date, time, alarms and preset 1 are done. I programmed preset 1 to my favorite classical music station. Helluva great sound for a non-HD, non-stereo radio. A relative of mine just bought this Sangean and is very happy with it as well. Like the fact that there is a headphone jack for private listening, or just connecting my iPhone to the auxiliary jack."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a great clock radio that will blow others out of the water. Great classic styling, easy to set up, easy to read and the radio is powerful, pulling in weak station and the sound quality is excellent. Dollar for dollar, this is one of the best buys out there.\nThe company I ordered it from was excellent. They replied immediately after order was placed, box that radio came in was undamaged and it arrived in a short period of time."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: One of the few clock radios in this price range that has digital tuning. For its size it really sounds great!  Sony has nothing to compare\/compete with this radio- very happy with purchase and highly recommend."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Great little alarm clock radio. The gradual alarm is so much nicer than the usual blaring ones. Includes an antenna for the decent-for-the-price radio. Came well packaged."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Fantastic, sophisticated clock radio. Allows me to listen to pillow headphone (I like to fall asleep with the radio on and my husband no longer complains) yet still wakes me up with audible alarm (even with the out jack plugged in). You can designate what channel and how loud the wake-up alarm uses.  So if you are listening to music at a loud volume before bed - no worries - it will wake you up with music or talk at a volume of your choice.  Can dim display brightness to your liking.  Feature rich.  Be sure to read the manual to take full advantage of robust options."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: We were looking for a replacement for our 37 year old GE clock-radio-phone. Actually, it didn't die, it just wouldn't shut off. Enter the Sangean. We thought we had a winner with it, even though it didn't have a phone. We loved the features: an alarm that gradually increased in sound, preset radio stations, compact in size, and what seemed to be a clear display. The display turned out to be more than we could live with - just too bright!. I figured out how to turn down the brightness (knob on the bottom of the unit), but down too low I couldn't read the time. Yellow is not a conducive background color for reading the numbers while glowing in the dark. Turning off the light was of course, no solution as nothing could be read. I am nearsighted, and even with the clock radio about a foot away it was too difficult for me to read it. I had no problem with the GE - that display was black numbers on a red background. I've heard that a yellow display light is difficult for eyes to adjust to, something about the cones in the eyes. We returned the unit."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Works fine but my need was AM reception because of area I live in. I have had the Sangean portable radio which has great reception and expected at least equal reception with this plug-in. As noted, it works fine but has limited AM reception."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Sadly, this thing bit the dust after 3 months.  The alarm seems to only go off when it feels like it.  Set it for weekdays and it woke me up on Saturday.  Seems no way to get the alarm to stop either, no bar or button works.  Attempted a reset, which, realistically you need three hands for, and pressed and pressed all the buttons and nothing happened.  Waste of money for me, and going to buy a different brand."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: good product how ever i was looking for an alarm clock that i can set for all seven days at once. the alarm being set for each separate day to go of at the times of my choosing. i think there is a different model by this company that has the said function . how ever i already got this one."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: This clock\/radio has lots of settings to deal with, then two months after the warranty ran out it broke.  Manufacture said radio was not suppose to come on while setting, so it was broke from the start.  Reset it to factory settings a number of times but was still unable to set radio stations.  This radio was junk for $40.00.  Seller said sorry too late to report and that they no longer make the radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I've owned and used a lot of clock radios over the years but this one is probably the best.\n\nIt's very easy to use.  The layout and size of the buttons are nice, all the buttons make sense, the manual is short and sweet, and within 3-4 minutes I had the whole thing figured out.  The unit is light but sturdy and the underside has nice, even support, allowing you to slide the unit easy around your night stand without making any noise.\n\nThe digital tuner is great.  No more old imprecise analog tuners.  You lock right onto the station you want.  The signal is clear and the FM antenna is a good addition.  Other reviews do mention a transformer hum, which is audible when the radio is on, but I'm very sensitive to this sort of thing and the hum is very low on mine, and is not bothersome at all.  The sound quality is very good.  It's still a clock radio speaker so don't get too excited, but it's probably the best sounding one I've heard.  The volume knob is large and easy to find.  It moves incrementally and the volume is represented digitally so you can remember specific volume settings for listening or for your alarms.\n\nThe display is a pleasant amber and the backlight brightness is fully adjustable by an analog knob on the bottom of the unit allowing exact control.  This is a great feature for anyone sensitive to the ridiculous amount of light that's put out by most LED clock displays; even the ones with a \"dim\" setting are insanely bright.  With this one you can go as dim as you like.  The only issue here is that the contrast becomes lower as the display gets dimmer, so the digits don't pop when the display is very dim.  They aren't nice and black against the backlight, they're more like a dimmed grey.  So if you have poor eyesight and you like things dim, you may not be able to easily make out the time in the middle of the night without getting close to the display.  But this is far better than being blinded by LED floodlights.  I also like the information layout.  I like having the seconds tick along next to the hh:mm, but the seconds digits are smaller and look like they're just tagging along.  A nice touch.\n\nAll the other listed features round out the device.  Station presets, alarm schedules, slowly-increasing volume for the alarms, and aux\/headphone jacks.\n\nThe power adapter is somewhat fat, but should fit fine in most standard duplex outlets top or bottom.  The cable is about 5 feet long, which is a little short for my taste but it seems to be the clock radio standard."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This clock radio is the least intuitive of any radio alarm clock that I have ever owned.\nIt is difficult to set and to have the alarm go off for just one date.\n\nI really dislike this product"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Got free shipping.  Received it two days after it shipped.  Of Course it did not ship for 5 days after I purchased it, or something like that.  I didn't care, shipping was still free.  Radio is OK.  I don't look for any product to be really good any more.  The little hotel type alarm clock that this Sangean replaced was better.  I think it was analog though.  I only paid 10.00 dollars for it at WM, several years ago.  I live in the middle of two 50,000 watt radio stations. One hundred miles either way.  One I get OK the other one that I like to listen to, not so good.  Little antenna not worth much, Would not buy supplement copper wire to run outside and add to the cost. Actually, now that I think about it, the only stations besides those two that I do receive,  are the Mexican stations there are plenty of them,  and they are all loud and clear,but I think they could be coming out of Mexico.  They walk all over all my other prospects for listening. Can't say I'm totally disappointed because I just use it when I wake up and can't sleep."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Does everything we need it to do. Nothing more. Nothing less.\nHas AM and FM. Has an earbud jack. Tuning capability is adequate with its little wire antenna. Volume level is good."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Works well except hard to hit alarm button off until you get used to how tiny it is and its location on the top of the alarm."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Clock radio has good features, alarm, snooze, nap, etc. Good reception.\n My problem is that the  directions for the setting of the alarm seem more difficult\nthan they really are. Very hard to see days of week, weekend, etc. options for setting alarm. Very tiny; I have to go get my glasses and\nput them on to see the days. Never quite sure if I have the right day for the alarm. Some electronic symbols appear on dial, but again\nare very small to read. Glad I could get it in black color for bedroom."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I initially rated this only 3 stars because after 13 months, the volume control stopped working, but 12 hours later it was mysteriously working fine.  I can't explain it,  Reading other reviews, the volume knob failing doesn't seem to be a common problem.  A certain proportion of reviewers had other types of failures, but that seems to be the case for all clock radios as I discovered while shopping for a replacement.  So I would not necessarily recommend avoiding this one if it appeals to you otherwise.\n\nAs far as the pros and cons, the other reviews cover them thoroughly, although with conflicting opinions.  My take on the areas that seem controversial:\n* FM reception: This is why I picked this one to begin with and it worked fine for me once I got the antenna wire in the right position.  My old clock radio had an internal antenna, as most do, and was not adequate in my current location.  The Sangean's external antenna mad the difference I needed.\n* AM reception:  I don't listen to AM, so I don't know, but based on other reviews, I would not buy this if I wanted AM.\n* Controls ans settings: Yes, they're a little complicated and not intuitive, but I was able to figure them out by reading the manual and the ones I use regularly became second-nature.\n* No battery backup: Almost all clock radios have this feature, even cheap ones.  I can't understand why this one doesn't.  On days I absolutely did not want to oversleep, I set my cellphone alarm as backup."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It does not set the time automatically.  And the alarm is not as easily adjustable as on other clock radios.  The feature I like is that it accommodates headphones."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I wasn't familiar with this brand. And it seemed like a relatively hefty price for a simple AM\/FM clock radio. But I decided to take a shot because of the digital tuner.\nSo far I haven't had any problems with the station fading out. There's been no waking up to static or having to feel around & try to tune in a station on an analog tuner that you can't see & even if you could, was often not properly calibrated.\nThe sound is pretty decent for what it is, especially when compared to some of the others I've had.\nThe negatives are: The display is hard to read under some conditions & especially at a distance. However this hasn't been a problem for me since it's right next to my bed where I can see it.\nAlso the controls are a little hard to see. And the alarm & on\/off buttons are easily mistaken for the station preset buttons in the dark with your eyes half shut.\nI can't remember off the top of my head whether or not this is supposed to automatically adjust for daylight savings time. But I did have to manually set it back an hour when  they changed over last month.\nIt is pretty easy to set though.\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this radio& would recommend it to anyone who needs a quality digital tuner to keep their favorite stations locked in and sound quality that's better than most similar radios."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love he fact that I can use head phones to listn to the radio. I haven't figured out how to set the alam for a one time use et but over all I love it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Great reception without interference in a location that has had a history of poor reception. So far the only complaint is too many functions on nearly identical buttons. They are all same size, closely located together without function separation wide enough to feel or even see in dim lighting. Very small print as well identifying function. As a result several false starts of an unintended function, break out the lights and step through canceling things like \"nap\" that are a bit difficult to just turn off."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I really like this radio.  It has good sound quality and the settings are fairly easy to understand.  I had one glitch where I had cancelled a tone alarm but the alarm went off anyway.  But I think the radio just got confused.  The digital tuning is very good.  The back light can be adjusted for brightness.  Very happy with my purchase."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I really wanted to like this clock radio . . . .\nbut I hate it and just threw it out.  I had it for two years.\nPros:  can set the light so it is fairly dim, so it doesn't bother you at night.  Can program five radio stations.  Two alarms.\nCons:  my unit had a terrible hum when the radio was on.  Reception was sub-par.  Perhaps most annoying is that when you turn the alarm on or off, it emits a shrill beep, which can wake your sleeping partner.  Changing the time for the alarm to go off also requires many steps which have a beep after each step--again, not good when you come to bed later than your partner and you need to change your wake up time.  Likewise, if you wake up before your alarm and want to shut the alarm off, again you must press a button that will beep loudly.  I usually ended up just turning the volume all the way down.  That's when you really notice the odd hum when the radio was on.  I just got a cube Sony clock with projector and so far it's great, much better radio reception and buttons that don't beep when turning the alarm on and off."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is exactly what I was looking for.  I purchased it after reading the reviews on Amazon.  Set up was easy.  The color, white, was an important feature for me.  It also has a headphone outlet, which was a must.  I am super pleased with my purchase!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I shop for months looking for just the right alarm clock. I am always disappointed within months when some aspect of it stops working, especially when I pay a good amount of money for it.  I have had this for only a few weeks but I am very happy, so far.  I don't use it for a time-piece to view. I have it located on a shelf on the wall. It is just for the alarms only. I also have it resting on its side so that the speaker is sounding in the direction that has the greatest impact.  I like that I can set dual times and for each time I can set for the weekdays or the weekends or both, separate volumes, and different stations if I wanted. Once the alarm goes off, it will automatically turn itself off in one hour. Since I set this alarm clock up, I haven't touched it once. I really really really like that feature. I have always used the one hour timer auto-shut-off timer on alarms as a way to get me out the door in a timely manner. Works perfectly.  For the money I paid, I should be able to get a couple years out of this alarm if it is made well. I sure hope so cuz I am tired of shopping for alarm clocks every six months."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Great radio, and has a lot of features for the price.  One thing I really liked is that the alarm still sounded even though the head phones were plugged in.  This means I can fall asleep to the radio and still have an alarm in the morning.!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This radio does everything I wanted it to.  It has a \"nap\" setting where you can have it turn off after a certain amount of time - just right for going to sleep to.  Also has a jack for headphones to I don't disturb my husband."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I find the numbers on this clock hard to see at night.  It does take some reading of the manual to set things up.  The alarm works well."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: I really dislike this clock. The numbers are almost impossible to see in the middle of the night--there's no contrast, just a bright orange bar. No matter how I adjust it, the numbers are next to unreadable, especially at night. So aggravating. The sound quality on the radio is excellent, and I do like how the radio alarm comes on softly and then increases in volume. But really...a clock radio where the clock is almost unusable?"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Cool orange display. The digital tuner is awsome seems to be well built I like it alot better than my SONY. A bit pricey but worth it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great product. Very good quality. Good reception, and good sound. Pretty easy to use. Has good features, but not too many features like some other complicated alarm radios. Love it."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: This item met my requirements for a an attractive bedside clock radio with a decent sound system.  Having bought Sangean products in the past I predicted I would get a quality product.  Unfortunately, setting the alarm has baffled me inspite of following the directions. Part of the problem is that the prompts are too small and, at least in my case, a second hand is needed to set the alarm. It seems to me that a person with several degrees can figure this out but it hasn't happened yet. So far the alarm worked once but I consider that a fluke."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The radio is fine but for two design elements that bug me. First, the dial to control the display brightness is underneath the unit, do you need to use two hands to adjust it. Second, being able to set alarms for weekdays or weekends is fine, hug it also then means that it's more complicated to set a basic alarm."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am happy to say that after much searching I found an AM\/FM clock radio that has both a sleep function that turns the radio off after a set number of minutes and a headphone\/earbud jack that allows me to listen to the radio without disturbing my wife.  The device has more functions that I have yet to either use or explore, such as a nap button as well as two alarm settings.  The user can preset five AM and five FM stations.  It is exactly what I wanted in a clock radio and so much more."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a great little radio.  Use it on some shelves in my bathroom.  Not great fidelity, but little radios aren't meant for that.  Love the adjustable display light - works great as a nightlight for the bathroom."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It works fine. I just wish it had a remote( I'm almost 70 and don't fly out of bed :-) - but it's fine for now.\n  Thanks - Bob"}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: I just bought it. Now it won't work. No face, no time, nothing. When it worked it was a 5 star. Sending it back :("}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The sound quality of this radio is very good; it's actually much better than my old Sony Dream Machine.  The display is bright and easy to read, and overall this is a good clock radio\/alarm clock.  Two must-haves for me are missing, hence the 2-star deduction.  1.  An adjustable screen brightness feature (this has one level of brightness: super bright, light the room bright).  2.  A gradual audio fade-out on the sleep timer (this shut-off was so abrupt that it woke me up, thereby defeating the purpose of a sleep timer).  If you don't care about brightness and fade-out, this is fine.  If you do care, it is a non-starter."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Just got it 10 hours ago. Unless you have a magnifing glass do not try to read diagram in the manual..  Very confusing to set up, icons on the display  are so small you havecto guess if what you set is right.  Guess i will know in morning if i set it for radio or Alarm.  I live within 10 miles of the transmitter for WTIC-AM a 50,000 watt radio station.  I can listen to that station 100 miles away in Vermont but not here in visual distance of the Antennas.\nIn fact i cannot get any AM stations at all.  I have reached out to Sangean and can't wait to have them tell me its not the radios fault but mine.  Old radio got same station innsame location and it was a piece of junk. FM is good but wire antenna is crap.  Backlight can be adjusted but before you ge it dimmed you realize you can no longer read the time.\n\nHey Amazon, do you sell time machines ?  Need to go back in time to when things were made to work and last..to when the companies cared about quality.  Now no one cares about anything.  Quality is no longer important.  Sangean obviously does not care."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: this clock radio is the best. So many more features, than other bedside clock radios. Not just sleep timer, but nap timer too! Easy to program, backlit so it's easy to see in the dark. Love it!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Love the clock. Great sound. Alarm set is a little funky, but not too bad. If you use the same time every day,it's great. You just shut off in the morning and your all set for the next day."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this clock radio (RCR-5) for \"her\" side of the bed and the big brother RCR-22 for \"my\" side of the bed. Really, it's almost the same clock. The RCR-22 has one or four more bells and whistles (for example, two automatic time setting modes) but the RCR-5 is really a solid performer. Fit and finish are excellent it doesn't feel like a \"cheap hotel\" clock either. Excellent radio reception. The sound is well above average for a mono speaker (I'm going out on a limb and going to say it actually sounds BETTER than the RCR-22 in a side by side comparison). Dual alarms. Digital tuner. Internal battery backup. Dimmable display trim knob. AUX in and headphone out. Nap function is handy for me but uses the beeper to wake in nap mode instead of the radio is my only complaint (like people who nap have much to complain about). Easy to set, just \"long press\" on the buttons when you need to change something and use the +\/- on the snooze button to adjust, then \"select\". I would buy this again. It's one of the best alarm clocks available today (and I looked high and low) and is also affordable. I may end up switching the two clock radios (if she lets me)!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love it!  This is my second Sanjean radio. The first is a portable that I bought a few years ago and still use. When I needed a new radio for my bedroom, I immediately looked at Sanjean.  Both are excellent in every way."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I kind of had a notion that this would be a quality product... I thought correctly. What I didn't plan on was HOW much I love this Clock radio. It doesn't just meet my expectations it exceeds them by a factor of a Million. I was on a quest to get a quality Alarm clock radio since my Panasonic was damaged in a move years ago and I have found, in this, something that makes me stop my quest. I would say I was on a quest on par with the hunt for the perfect pillow. This kind of reminds me of a miniature Bose wave radio in its build quality."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: My dad is older, and really picky about his radios.  After trying 2-3 other radios and complaining about size, sound, features, etc, he finally had me buy this one for him.  He LOVES it!  He praises the controls, the clarity, the sound quality, and everything about the radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I had it for a few week now and still learning about this radio. I follow the insert but sometimes, I lose the station. This is nice looking radio which does not take up much of space. It came with 10 preset stations. The nap feature is cool- set the nap time, beeps and turn it off."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I like this radio.  Reception is good, better than the one I had.  I didn't think setting the clock was as difficult as some of the reviews I read had said it was."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Great quality radio with good reception of weak stations and good sound.\n\nBought a second one but in this one the front panel lighting is not uniform.  The side edges are bright where the light bulbs are located but the center is dimmer.  Minor flaw but can make the viewing time not as as easy."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Sangean quality. However the contrls are not very easy to use. We always have to get out the owners manual. Also if power out more than a few min we have had issues"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The sound quality is good but it was difficult to set up the radio because it has so many settings.  Spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to disable the alarms."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: A very well made clock radio. The only thing I would change is the display. Hard to see a sharp image without correction. Even after repeated adjusting of the backlight level. This was not the case with my previous RED LED clock. Volume control is top notch. Tuner is great. Layout of product is well done and logical. A very good buy."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great features, and great radio reception, which is important to me. Good size, too. Setting the alarm is a bit complicated, but worth it. You can choose what radio station to wake to, even if you listen to a different station the night before. I've been looking for just the right clock\nclock radio for years and this is finally it."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Ordered 2 of these.  Thesee feel solid and good quality except that one of then is fast by 6 minutes per hour and loses the alarm setting."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I've had this radio for 3 years and had difficulty turning in most AM stations.  Luckily, the two AM\/FM stations I wanted to listen to came in late at night, so the radio served its purpose.  Recently I accidently knocked it off the night stand (it only fell 2 feet to a carpeted surface), but lost all AM reception.  Still get the FM stations, but to me it's useless unless I can get both.  I live in Tulsa, OK and never understood why I could only get one AM station. Everything else seemed to work fine. No sure I can send it back for repairs."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Very disappointed in this clock radio.  In order to change the alarm you have to go through 5 steps. You can't change the radio volume for the alarm by adjusting the volume manually.  You have to use the procedure to change the alarm. This is very time consuming In addition to that the volume is a number so that you have to keep experimenting to get the correct volume.. Wouldn't buy this clock radio again."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very good sound I like it and I like the size and color.  I am not very mechanical so I wish when our power went out it\nwould keep the time"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: LOVE IT TRIPLE  AAA  AN A BIG TEN ALL THE WAY SOUND QUALITY EXCELLANT I FOUND IT EASY TO PROGRAM,LOVE THE PUSH BUTTO N S TO TUNE THE STATIONS,GRATE PRODUCT........."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Yes, I am satisfied from the product. It took some time until it arrived because you can't ship  it directly to my address, and I needed to use my friend's address and waited until he comes to Israel. Unfortunately, the power unit supplied was not suitable to Israel voltage and I should purchase another one at cost of $10.00.\nShimon Feuchtwanger"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The locations of the buttons could be done better - the \"nap\" button is right next to the one that turns the radio on and to turn off the nap feature, you have to go through all the cycles.  Same with many of the other buttons.  It would be nice if they used a raised marking on the alarm buttons to distinguish them from the ones that are used to program the radio stations.  However, I really like the unit."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Complicated; takes a while to figure out to use its features.  Wish it had a USB plug and a battery back-up that would eliminate the need to reset after an extended period of power loss.  Otherwise an excellent clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I looked long and hard to find a quality dual alarm clock radio that I could listen to without white noise on it, that would lock into the stations and this radio sure fits my needs.  First, it really has great sound quality.  I have been able to set up all the things like date\/the time, program the stations so don't need to search, the alarm, nap timer, all.  No problem.  Easy to follow instructions.  It has a very attractive appearance, a good size, not too large, doesn't take up much room on bed side table, looks quality, not cheaply made, very nice.  I like the amber color and the light is diimmable, you can brighten or dim the light using a small white knob located on the under side of the radio.  The amber color is very soothing (to me)..  Radio came packaged well.  I like that it has a 10-minute battery back-up which will come in handy if disconnected for a short time.  But what was really important to me was a radio with a good quality of sound.  And it has that.  I listen to radio a lot and can't have anything else.  Very glad I took the time to check out the reviews, I felt I had a 'heads up' before I purchased this radio and am definitely not disappointed in the least.  Attractive, easy to use, great sound, it seems to have it all.  I didn't expect to find a clock radio with an alarm of this quality in this price range.  But I did."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Reception in our office building isn't great but it is better than two other radios I purchased at W-world and returned for a refund. There is a cord for an attempt at an antenna and the dimmer is completely adjustable now. It is located on the bottom of the unit as a little knob. Spend the money for this and it will be a better quality and longer lasting than even Sony.\n\nI also recommend this brand if you want one for the shower. Best shower radio ever!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great little radio purchased for the office to replace something thats been sitting in the break room for god only knows how many years.  Digital tuner  is great, easy to learn and set up.  Sound is clear and loud enough."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It's not that easy to set an alarm and I can't tell just by looking at it if it is set.  I do use it.  Thank you..."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Pretty much as described and reviewed, but the radio sound quality is really all you can expect from the small speaker and there is no \"bass boost\" or other enhancement technology that I can detect (some reviewers raved about the sound quality...I don't know why?  Other than that it is a very good little clock radio that is small, but easy to see day and night (the adjustable backlight should please most users).  If all you need is an alarm clock and aren't particular about the radio, then this is a little pricey."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I just received this yesterday and I already love it.  It's pretty small and good-looking.  After reading some of the reviews about the difficulty in setting it up, I was a little put off, but it turned out to be quite simple.  It's replacing a radio in my bathroom that had a big fat cord so it's great to have the thin AC adaptor cord which can be tidily wrapped up (since I need only about a foot of length to reach the outlet).  I also like the white color and white cord which is much less noticeable on my white counter."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Everything about this is worthy of 5 stars except that the back lit time is hard to read... Which is pretty key to having a clock! I have experimented with turning the backlight up (which makes for too much light if you like to sleep in the dark) and down, which makes the time impossible to read. Everything else is truly great."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Good reception, but the buttons are small and hard to figure out. Reception is good, but if you wear glasses and need to push the right button in the morning after the alarm goes off, you could get a bit confused. Otherwise, it seems to fit our needs."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I had to return the clock because the date wouldn't ser correctly.  Otherwise I was a nice clock.  If the date setting would have worked I'd have given it 4 stars."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I really like this digital clock radio.  I like it that you can have one alarm for the weekdays and one for the weekend.  Reception seems to be very good on AM and FM stations.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great, small profile, digital clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Not thrilled about the orange light... it is orange like in the picture.  Usually you can set the alarms, radio without reading the manual. This one you have to read how to do what you want to do."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Update on this radio. I loved all the features and it was dependable however it stopped working just under its second year of use. I was hoping it would last longer. Im going to repurchase and hope for more life from the next one."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: It's too easy to inadvertently hit the alarm and nap buttons when changing stations. This is not a good ergonomic design. The station buttons should not be in line with the clock functions. I find it impossible to set the year, date and day. No matter what I do it reverts to year 2043. Definitely some kind of defect. I don't use the alarm function at all. Nor do I care about years, months, days and dates, only the time. The volume knob looks analog but is really digital with discrete detents. Radio reception is good in my area."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Tried to contact store per their e-mail and they refused to assist me as they stated in their e-mail.  I would never purchase from Store123 - Amazon Market place again.  The directions are unclear on how to set the alarm to awake to my favorite radio station at 4:00 am.  The radio also had poor sound quality."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This radio has two alarm functions. A nice feature is that tuning is done in digital increments making finding a station extremely easy. There are five presets for AM and five for FM. It has delayed turn-off for when resting prior to going to sleep. Also a napping-timer that will wake one up after up to 2 hours. Volume is controlled by a analog dial. Reception is good. The manual is needed to set the alarm features or you may struggle."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Radio seems to operate just fine. The digital FM tuning was the key function I was looking for and it appears to work well here in Hawaii. The radio has the usual mix of alarm clock functions. I lowered the rating by one star reflecting the poor instructions that accompany the radio. Other reviewers have noted this, too. It is not obvious how to set up the various functions, the alarm icons are not described (a simple picture would have helped a lot), and the written instructions finally make sense after you figure out how to set things. We have the radio across the room from our bed and it is impossible to read the time display, but it would be fine if the radio was on a nightstand close to the bed."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: buttons a little hard to get used to but I bought it to  turn into a specific radio channel that I couldn't get with the tuner on my old radio."}

{"review":"This is a very positive review: Awesome clock radio. Set up an alarm for weekdays, never need to mess with it again. Just go to bed without fiddling with an alarm on my phone and wake up to the local radio station. Great sound quality. Convenient snooze button. Adjustable volume for alarms. Adjustable display brightness is brilliant. 3.5mm input if you want to play your own music.\n\nAlso, setting up an alarm on this is not hard. Just spend 10 minutes walking through the manual and then you'll never have to do it again.\n\nGreat clock. I don't really know how a clock can get much better than this one, unless it also brewed your coffee."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Nice alarm clock.  It just has a nice look and feel.  it has dual alarms, 5 presets and dim-able back-light.  The back-light color is more pleasing at 3:00am than other LED colors I've had in the past."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The radio is hopeless at picking up AM reception in my area - which is what I wanted it for as it had a headphone jack. I have put it back in the box and put it in a cupboard. It will never be used. Not worth the postage cost of sending it back from Australia to the US"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I had high hopes for this clock radio because it was one of the only radios that has a 3.5mm audio out port.  Unfortunately, this product was a disappointment from the start.  From the moment I plugged in the clock radio, the built in speaker made terrible hissing crackling noise."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I just got this sangean. Already the radio has stopped functioning. Lasted @1week. I'm not pleased with product & plan on returning it as quickly as I can. Not sure if I'd get another one."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Its ok but after a month or so unless you go back in and go thru the set up for an alarm you have set up for the clock radio it stops working."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was looking for a clock radio that actually had some sound(instead of a speaker in a tuna can like most clock radios) and held radio stations well, and this did not disappoint....no, its not a bose wave radio but neither is the price. don't care for the display though, it puts a yellow hue in the room(it is adjustable) and the icons are too small.....but this is on a nightstand- maybe it would be better in a bookcase headboard. I had no trouble programming right out of the box, don't know why other reviewers had trouble, I love the station preset feature, the humane wake system and nap feature..........if you are looking for a good sounding, reasonably priced clock radio loaded with features this is the one"}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This Sangean Clock Radio works correctly but is difficult to program.  Instead of having the buttons simply marked, on\/off, snooze, etc., there are just random symbols which aren't very easy to ascertain what they mean.  I bought two for my 18 and 11 year old daughters.  We all have to look at the instruction manual or spend three times as long as it should take to figure out the simple things like setting the time.  Once its et up, It's easy to remember the snooze and alarm set but other options are a struggle.  My middle daughter has a different alarm clock that has all the same options but is labeled properly and is simple to program."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I replaced a clock radio that could not receive the radio station that I wanted... We are in an area far away from the station so I went looking for a radio with better reception.  This radio worked and received the station clearly, exactly what I needed it to do.  One nice thing is that you have control over the brightness of the display although at the lower level there is not a lot of contrast between the numbers and the background.  All in all It is a good choice and the price is right.."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This device looks nice but I am returning it.  The instruction manual comes in 5 languages, English, French, Spanish, Dutch and German.  Whoever wrote the manual obviously does not have English as a first language. But what frustrated me the most is that it said, replace the batteries if you will not be using the unit for a long time.  What batteries?  There is no battery compartment, there are no batteries for the unit.  Further instructions say that the \"battery\" (singular this time) will retain the settings for about 10 minutes.  Ten minutes!?!  So, if your electricity is out for eleven or more minutes, the built-in battery backup is worthless.  Also, this device comes with an adapter, not a regular cord, so it will use up space on your wall outlet, preventing you from plugging in anything else.  Done so it could be used in different countries, no doubt; but inconvenient.  Oh how I wish there were just ONE American manufacturer who made quality clock radios in the USA, designed for use in the USA.  At any rate, this device goes back right away."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Most of the clock radios I have tried have one major shortcoming -- the display is too bright.  My nightstand is right by my bed, so the display is not much more than 16\" from my face.  I don't need the xenon projector bulbs that most clock radios seem to use.  If they have an adjustment, it is usually just a high\/low switch between atomic and nuclear settings.  This radio has an adjustable display brightness that is \"infinitely\" variable from off to full bright.\n\nThe second major plus to this radio is the reception, which is what Sangeans are know for.  We live in a condo, and the bed end of our bedroom is nested into a bunch of interior walls.  So, reception can be a bit of a problem.  My last radio (a Sony) just couldn't cut it, no matter which way I stretched out or coiled the antenna wire .  This radio is getting rock-solid reception, without even unwrapping the antenna wire.\n\nIf I have one nit to pick with the design of this unit, it is that the power button is also the alarm-off button.  That button is the same size and shape as every other button, and it can be hard to find it quickly when I am still mostly asleep.  But, all in all, this is a nice solid radio that works well."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: good quality clock radio with preset buttons.  controllable lighting on display.  a glowing on\/off button helps you find the control in the dark.  altogether a good value."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this a year and a half ago and after unplugging it to wipe it off (a lot of dirt get trapped in the top) I plugged it back in a little while after and the radio stopped working! Clock and light still work fine so I'm not sure what happened. Because it's not under a year since I bought it, the warranty has expired and when I called the company to have it repaired they told me it would cost $28 to repair + $8 to ship it, AND take 4  6 weeks. That's only a dollar less than the price Amazon is selling the new ones for, but I may end up having it repaired since, well, waste sucks.\n\nI am very disappointed because up until this point this has been a GREAT kitchen radio. I really only used it for listening to talk radio so I can't speak to it's sound performance playing music. I also enjoyed using the radio alarm clock function, worked like a charm. Ugh, so sad.\n\nWord to the wise, leave this thing unplugged for hours after you clean it to be safe!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I had previously purchased the portable Sangean radio which has an excellent sound but this is also brilliant.\nConsidering we live in the countryside, I can clearly get many stations.  Good products."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: AM reception is weak.  FM is loud and clear.  The volume control is digital.  The lowest setting (1) is too loud for strong stations.  The only way to decrease the volume level below 1 is to use plug in earphones with an in-line volume control.  The radio is FM stereo, but the stereo can only be heard with stereo earphones because the radio has only one speaker.  Overall, a pretty good radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio was a gift for my husband, whose requirements included: simple, small, AM\/FM signals, good sound quality. I did a lot of research and bought this radio. It has delivered on all accounts, especially the sound, which is impressively good, whether you're listening to NPR, rock or smooth jazz. We use it in the kitchen, where it doesn't take up a lot of counter space, and we can hear it just fine in the dining and living rooms without blaring it."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: It took a while to figure out how to set everything, and dim the light, but now it's doing exactly what we bought it for."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Compact, good sound, love the dual alarm. Has nice features. And you can really dim the light on it -- I used to put an old hat on my other clock radio b\/c it was like a stadium next to my head."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I live near Orlando and the best jazz radio station on the planet. It's just out of reach of my radios and getting it online just seems like a waste so I took a chance on this one to see if Sangean had the right stuff--and it does. This little box brings it 5X5. Some reviewers are disappointed with the sound but I like it. Frequency response is limited but within the limits it has that nice tight \"sony\" sound. Need more bass? Plug in powered speakers to the headfone jack. And it's cute and tells time. Nice."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This radio has very good sound for such a small radio.......... That said the rest is pretty bad !!  All the buttons which are lined up in a row are NOT very useful when waking or fumbling during the night because they are indistinguishable, one from the other.  The other BIG item is the display which is not readable except at full brightness.  When on full bright, it lights up the room, when dimmed it becomes unreadable......  I love Sangean radios, but this one is NOT for bedside alarm clock >>> it's gone back with me disappointed."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a great product.  I've had it long enough now to judge it and I'm so glad that I bought it.  I live in an area with poor reception,  It's picking up stations that I could only get on my car radio before.  Although it isn't stereo, the sound is much better than any clock radio that I've heard.  I thought the gradual sound increase on the alarm was silly when I read about it, but, it's actually kind of nice.  I wish the alarm shut off was a little more handy.  It's a little hard to find when your sleepy headed."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Overall, very pleased.  I like the small footprint and I love now having the pre-set buttons.  And the ONLY reason I upgraded to this clock radio from my current one was because it's one of the few that has the ear phone output (input?) AND the pre-sets for AM-FM.  Sound is good (wish it were stereo, however) and brings in distant stations without a problem.  Sets up very easily and I DO like the ease with which to set the sleep timer - I use this every night with a pair of lightweight earphones (wish there were a few more choices other than: 60, 45, 30 or 15 min.).  All the buttons are on the top and well placed - don't have to fumble and reach around to the side or back to initiate functions.  Front illumination on face is easily dimmed to your preferences and well-lit - easy to see at night and day."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This clock radio is exactly what I wanted.  Very easy to set alarms and the stations lock in and can be programmed like a car radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Bought this for my 10-yr old son. He needed an alarm clock and radio- he likes to listen to baseball games in bed at night. He didn't need bluetooth, cell phone or ipad docking station or anything like that. This has been perfect so far - it's well made, has good controls, and gets excellent radio reception."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Wish I hadn't bought this.\nPositives:  this clock radio has excellent radio reception and I like the ability to preset stations.  But the negatives: the display is too bright.  Why didn't they illuminate the numbers instead of the background? Illuminating the background produces way too much light.  If you dim the display the contrast goes way down and I can't read the time.  If the display is bright enough to read the numbers, it is way too bright for sleeping.  And setting the alarm is unnecessarily complicated.  And you can't just hit a button to turn the alarm set on or off, you have to go through the whole process again.  My old clunker is so much easier to use."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: It's difficult to find a decent AM\/FM clock radio nowadays. This one seems to work well. The volume for AM seems a bit lower than that of FM, but I rarely listen to AM anymore. The display dims down nicely and unlike other reviewers, I don't find it difficult to read the clock."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Good reception on both AM & FM bands. Sets up easily and alarms work well. Only minor complaint is volume isn't real strong but then again I'm hard of hearing."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love this radio.  I have it at my work, and I get a clear signal in my cube.  Very good quality for the price."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Reception is better than most but still substandard on rainy days-- I just can't get clear signal on AM high watt station. And I dislike the alarm set up, very confusing. I could have bought something cheaper, feh"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: perfect clock radio for guest room. I love that I can pre-program stations and the tuner does not drift! Rock solid. I also love the ability to dim the display and the amber color helps preserve night vision if a guest needs to get up during the night. I only with the volume control let me set the audio lower. The \"1\" setting is fine but I'd like a \"whisper\" setting for leaving the radio on all night. The white color is a nice change and does not look dusty as quickly."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This was to replace an alarm clock\/radio.  The radio is functional, but not a good as the one we have had previously. The old one was analog radio, and the reception become noisy, scratchy.  This radio has a little better reception, but seems the technology has not improved. The choice of alarm\/radio's is very limited.  It seems this needed device is disappearing from the market place."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: As this was a grift for a 8 year old, it is fine. But it is not a radio that an adult would want.  The time display is bad and the quality of the radio is poor."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was looking for a good work radio with fm\/am radio and a clock. This one came nicely packaged and the set up was very easy. The sound is great. I am very happy with it."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Sound is not what I would expect of Sangean, even at this price.  The worst thing, though, is that disabling the alarm, cancelling the setting, is so complicated and the directions so poorly written that neither my wife nor I could get it cancelled.  We finally removed it from the bedroom.\n\nNot user-friendly.  Bad choice."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: After about one month, the power pack on the electrical cord started to buzz and hum. Since it was still under warranty, I sent the bad power pack and $8 to Sangean for replacement. It took a couple of months to receive the replacement. The new power pack was DOA; probably from being damaged in the mail due to Sangean mailing it in a flimsy paper envelope. So, I contacted Sangean and they wanted another $8 for another cord replacement. In my mind, I thought it would be better to return the whole unit to Amazon, get a full refund and then re order the unit again from Amazon. The reason for wanting to reorder the same unit was because despite some major engineering flaws in this radio, this little radio has the best radio reception I have ever come across! I could pull in far away stations really well, and the sound was great! My plan didn't work very well on the return to Amazon. The first roadblock was that it was past the time that Amazon would accept a return on the item. But, when I told Amazon the story of the 3 month warranty return etc, Amazon let me return the unit for credit. Next problem here was that Amazon charged an $8 restocking fee!!!!! I am really not happy with this. Also, if this unit was restocked, the future buyer of this is in for a surprise, because the power unit is dead! If you are planning on buying this little clock radio here are some more negatives to think on. There are a lot of buttons on the top of the radio, but only the power on button is lit. This makes it hard to figure out what button to push at night. Also, the backlit display has  a dimmer and brightener knob, but it is on the underside of the unit and is hard to adjust. Plus, holding the unit up to dim or brighten the display invariably you will hit one of the top buttons. Here are the positive things about this unit: 1. Great radio reception. 2. Easy to understand set up. 3. good instruction manual. 3. Has all the sleep, and timer functions you would want on a radio....Had high hopes for this unit, but manufacturer really messed up on the warranty repair!!! Also really unhappy with Amazon's restocking fee."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Bought this to keep in the work office. Bright display and the keeping point is that it has a headphone jack for listening so not to distract other people. Also has audio in for plugging in your iPod, etc."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Pleased with this purchase. The sound is excellent for a small radio. Has some nice features, two separate alarms, both are adjustable for volume volume, both have tone or radio options. The lighted display has a full range of brightness choices and the time numerals are large and easy to read. There is additional info on the display showing which alarms are set and for which days of the week. Radio has a digital tuner and locks on the selected stations. There are buttons for your favorite stations. Only drawback is the buttons are small and the use of them is not intuitive. You will most likely need to refer to the manual. I did. This would not be a good choice for an person tends to by confused my technology. But I am very pleased with it and the price is extremely reasonable."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: Several radios I own are going to the church rummage sale.  I needed a radio with good tuning on the non-commercial portion of the radio dial, since most of what is on the commercial end is garbage.  The Sangean RCR-5 tunes to these close spaced station without any problem.  Setting the radio up was rather simple, even without reading the instructions.  I did read the instructions for further detail, but the setup was simple.  You can buy a cheaper radio, but if it doesn't pick up what you want to listen to, you're throwing your money away.  At least the church will make a few dollars on the ones I discarded."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Well pleased with sound quality, very clear voice and music reception -- No station drift ... However, do have a few specific negatives -- The LED window could be sized larger -- Being an octogenarian with diminished eyesight, I have problem viewing LED ... The sound volume control is not consistent on volume increase or volume decrease -- I have to firmly push volume control knob inward, then rotate before any noticeable volume change is effected ...  Furthermore, not being a 'young one' with formidable technical skills and lacking in technological adaptability, I found it quite confusing and difficult to set the time, the alarms, nap and other programs  ... Gave 4 star rating because I am impressed with concepts you were able to incorporate in a small package -- But -- This is not a clock radio for older people of my ilk.\n\nR. F. Bailey"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is the absolute BEST alarm clock I have ever owned.  First and foremost, the quality of the cabinet is phenomenal - it is heavier than other models I looked at during my research.  The buttons are all very clearly labeled and while some people may find the instructions on the dual alarms convoluted, if you take the time to read them, it is very easy to set this clock accurately.  I love having the dual alarm that can be set for the work week on the first and the second for whenever needed.  It would also work great for those couples who need to wake up at different times, as you can have both alarms set at once for different times (my husband and I tried this, as we awaken 4 hours apart, and it worked great - but this is MY clock! He can get his own!).  I get GREAT reception on the radio - both FM AND AM.  The amber-glow face was the biggest thing that drew me to this clock, as it has that \"retro\" feel to me that I love - and is dimmable, which is a plus, and gives me just enough light next to the bedside that if I have to get up, I am not tripping over anything, while being non-intrusive to sleep.  I am always more than willing to spend money for a durable, well-made product and this is one purchase I DO NOT regret making!  This clock is well worth it!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very nice radio with several unique features. It sounds better than any other clock radio that I have heard. It is small and attractive."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I received my Sangean RCR-58K Digital Am\/FM Clock radio, and within three months the digital tuner was not functioning correctly.  I had bought it because of the digital tuner, easy moving between AM for news and FM for talk radio while shaving.  In addition to the tuner issue, I had trouble with the clock:  The year would change to 1993, and I had to unplug the unit and wait a day or two before I could reset it. The last time the clock reset, I was no longer able to tune radio stations, and unfortunately, t"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Fantastic as a radio -- great reception.  Poor alarm functionality  --- cannot tell when looking at clock\/radio whether it's armed or not.  Display is dim.  Also all buttons and button location is too close and similar.  Just as easy to select \"nap\", \"sleep\" or station #6 by hitting adjacent button on top."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Pleasantly surprised, even though it took more than a month to be delivered.  Sangean makes a quality product at a reasonable price and this small clock\/radio was definitely worth the wait!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Finding a small AM\/FM radio that is NOT battery powered was a good trick.  This is it and I love it.  Perfect on my kitchen counter.  The only thing that would make it better would be digital tuning."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: the clock went bad shortly after i bought it ,when i called them directly they were not nice about it,so if u plan on buying this company think again"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I have quit using this clock radio after a month.  After spending a lot of time on Amazon finding a clock radio I went to Wal-Mart and bought one of the two that they had for sale where I could see and touch it.\n\nPro:  The radio worked ok; not all of them do.  It has good features if you can figure them out.  Mine did not adjust for daylight savings time although it knows the date\n\nCon:\nI found I really dislike the backlit display compared to illuminated LED's.  It puts out a lot of light in the bedroom.  The numbers are smaller than most clock radios.  This caused me to give up on it.\n\nThe radio was hard to setup even with the instructions.  The first step is to put the date in.  I had a very hard time getting the radio to store the date.  Then I moved on to the alarms which are a learning curve.  The first push is for Monday-Friday.  Nice, but I work four days a week.  I only want alarm, not radio.  I did not have a positive experience with the radio.  I keep thinking this may be a product of German engineering with an emphasis on engineering and not so much on a friendly customer interface.\n\nNow I have to do a sale on eBay.  This costs too much for an experiment to be discarded.  I should have paid closer attention to the reviews.  I also remember that this was one of the better review clock radios."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: i was looking for a clock radio with a good sound and a display that would be easy to read in my very sunny bathroom. So five stars for that. My only problem with this radio so far is that the buttons to set the alarm and change the time are not very intuitive. I never would have used the alarm button, but when DST happened, I had to change the time. Next thing you know the radio was going off at crazy times. Finally figured out how to turn the alarm settings off. So probably four stars for that. Otherwise an excellent purchase."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Difficult to set up, directions need review for clarity and missing items. Really need directions for changing settings. I do enjoy digital radio, audio clearer. The alarm has great sound. This is a new purchase of a clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I do not recommend as a bed side radio.  The buttons are not lit up and too small, only the power will have a light but will go out when turned on.  I have trashed out many times looking for the power or the presets.  Only to push the nap button, then 10 min later the nap alarm goes off.\nIt is now in the garage!"}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: The display light is so bright that I have to face it away from my bed and cover it up so it won't disrupt my sleep.\n\nSetting the alarm is over complicated.  I've had the clock for years and still have to look at the instructions when I change my alarm time. It's not very user friendly.\n\nExtra star because the radio has a good reception."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: A great looking and sounding radio for a very reasonable price.  Good performance at pulling in distant stations, particularly when connected to a good FM antenna, although the simple wire antenna that comes with it does a good job too.  Not the easiest to set up the first time or to set the alarm, but patience and practice yields results."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love how dim the display can be, it doesn't wake me up and it doesn't light up my room at night, which was my main reason for purchase.  It does not have the blue or red glow which is bad to have in your room at night assuming your goal is sleeping.  This has been working perfect.  I love the short height and small size, fits great on my night stand next to my night light.  Get this."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a great radio.  It is easy to operate with a great sound.  I am able to get stations I could not get before in the location (bathroom) I have it in.  Very few white ones are available with white cord.  It is nice to be able to program 10 stations.  It is perfect for my needs and so glad I discovered this to replace my old huge brown\/black clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great clock radio.  Small footprint and awesome alarm.  It starts out quietly and gets louder in steps until you turn it off.  Recommend it for antone."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It would be fine if I only wanted to listen to the radio but we needed an alarm.  I never could get the alarm set.  I'm sending it back."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Construction is pretty solid, but how the controls are supposed to work is not obvious.  You shouldn't have to go digging through a rather dense user's manual to figure out how to set an alarm clock!  This thing is more complicated than my new HDTV.  Also, the buttons are small and poorly arranged - frustrating when you're half asleep to find the Snooze button.  Would NOT recommend."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Excellent radio - but ergonomics poor. It's too easy to turn on the Nap feature - and there's no way you'll figure out how to turn it off without getting out the instructions.  Have two."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: It's great . . . I think. When I finish my electronics engineering degree I'll be able to set it up . . . maybe!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Decent radio reception, nice clock display, easy to set up and use.  The wall plug is quite chunky, almost didn't fit behind our cabinet.  Case is a bit cheap looking.  Otherwise fine."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I purchased this as a replacement for my ole Sangean clock radio which had started to pick up alot of static interferrence.  I love the new design.  It's size is st greatly reduced from my old one as to be unrecognizeable.  It is a very comfortable size for a bedside stand.  I also like the amber glow as opposed to the old green display.  Much easier on the eyes.  Most of the rest is very similar to the older Sangean.  I would give it 4 1\/2 stars if possible.  Not worthy of 5 stars because (1) there is NO battery backup in case of a power failure and (2) I find it much more user unfriendly to set the times for the dual alarms (althought the \"weekday only\" feature is a very nice addition).  All in all, I would not hesitate to recommend this clock radio to anyone."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I love everything about the alarm clock except the location of the button to turn the alarm off.  The snooze button is very wide and at the front so it's easy to hit.  If I want to finally turn the alarm off instead of hitting snooze again.. I have to fish around for the small button to the right, the second one back from the front while half asleep.  One nice feature is when I program the alarm for radio, it goes off very low volume and slowly ramps up to the level you preset.  The max volume level it ramps up to and the radio channel used for alarm are independent from the volume and channel used the last time I listened to the radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: UPDATE: I've had this radio for a while and it really is annoying how difficult it is to operate. Of course I read the manual and \"learned\" how to set the alarm, BUT there is nothing easy or intuitive about that whole process. And turning off the alarm is also NOT a simple thing to do. One of the big problems is that the entire row of operating buttons across the top - and there are NINE OF THEM - are identical in size and shape. Well, when you wake up still half-asleep in the morning and want to change something on the radio you can easily hit the wrong button, or not hold a button long enough to get the change you want.\n\nFor a long time I had a Sharper Image clock radio\/CD with many different features, and at first that too was a little complicated for me to figure out how to operate, but once I understood it, it became easy because there was a kind of logic to each step. When it \"died\" I would have been happy to replace it with a new one, but it was discontinued.\n\nFor this Sangean, on the other hand, there are no simple distinctions between various functions you have to set. I know Sangean products are dependable, and have excellent sound quality for radio reception, and after having looked at reviews of other clock radios on Amazon I really didn't see a decent alternative. So I'm sticking with the Sangean, but hoping they hire some engineers who can produce a much more user-friendly and intelligently designed clock radio!\n\n(Here is my original review, after having the radio a very short time: Very good radio, compact, but not the most-user friendly. It takes some time to figure out all the settings. I'm a fan of Sangean radios. Excellent sound quality."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Nice radio overall quality is good. The tuner is very good! receives stations  that with my old radio i had to play with the tuner to get just right and gets some stations that i couldn't get in my bed room with the old radio. The sound quality is very good with the FM and just good with the AM  cant figure that out since it only has the one speaker. It was simple to set up i did read the instructions . I really like having the station presets, for such a small radio i am happy."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Sound quality is poor even for a radio of this price.  Go to WalMart or Target where you can turn on the radio and listen to it first.  If I had I would have purchased something else."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This small clock radio has great sound.  I can get my favorite PBS station and also an AM station that plays golden oldies.  The radio that I replaced was larger but did not have the great reception that this one has.  It was easy to set up and is easy for me to turn on and off even in the dark.  I am very happy with it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I like the radio. For the price, it sounds good.  The reason I bought it was it had gotten good reviews and the price was ok."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: very nice clock, but i too had a hard time figuring out how the alarm worked, and setting the noise level of the alarm. i would do a practice test- because the first time i set it, it was too low and i slept through it. i found 21 to be just right. i wish the alarm was easier to set- it almost has too many options (weekly, just the weekend, once). but now that i've figured it out i am happy with it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent FM reception.  Handy features include a sleep button, a nap button where you can use the clock like a timer to awaken you at 15 minute intervals, dimmable display, a headphone jack so you can listen without disturbing your partner at night, an easy to adjust volume dial, and 10 station presets (5 for FM and 5 for AM)."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Works good.  The preset buttons let you program the stations you like to listen to.  From that point on you can simply press the program button.  When the alarm turns on the radio, it starts out soft and slowly go loud.  I really like that.\n\nIt has so many features, I haven't mastered all of them yet.  It has two alarms and each of them can be set for time and day of the week.  It can be every day or just week days."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Purchased a Third one (3 different locations) as there was a need for another one.  All work very well and pick up weak station just fine.  Love it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Radio is clear and has good selectivity for which we are pleased.  The wall wart power supply is noisy and for a bedroom radio is louder then we would like."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I  didn't like the features on this radio.  The tuning was completely foreign to me.  I was looking for a simple to operate clock radio with alarm.  Apparently, they are hard to find so I took a chance on this one.  It might be ideal for others but wasn't for me."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Very good sound for this radio. I like the fact you can set alarm for weekday and weekend. Plus when it awakes you by radio, it starts at low volume and then increases."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: There are some nice features of this radio that I like.  The backlighting is nice and the fact that it can be adjusted is a real nice feature.  The sound is good.  It does sound a little muffled, but it might be because it is sitting on a towel on the night stand which may cause the muffled sound.  The alarm is not very loud, but I have not played with it enough to see if it can be adjusted.  Overall, it is a nice clock radio and does wake me up with the radio feature.  It is a nice size and fits nicely on the night table."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: You can not see the clock when it is dark.  We followed the instructions to change the background lighting and the numbers still were not visiable.  We ended up returning this and buying a different brand which is working much better."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Love this little radio.  I do not hear the static on my favorite (NPR) FM station that had been such a problem with other radios.  This is perfect for my bedside because it is small, the display light dims to a low level that does not disturb sleep, and it is orange display light rather than blue so it is very unobtrusive.  Easy to set up.  Buttons are nice because you do not have to look for them in the dark like some now that are totally flat.  If I need another radio I would not hesitate to buy another one of these."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am pleased with my purchase. It does everything well and the sound is better than I expected from a small speaker. The back light can be adjusted so as not to be a problem for even the lite sleeper.  I would recommend it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I am pleased with clock and find the radio reception much better than my old Sony. However I found the clock numbers hard to read because of the background light. They need to be darker and separate from background dimmer. If not for this my rating would be higher."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Works well with good sound and reception.  I enjoy being able to preselect stations rather than spinning a dial to find them. I also like the gentle wake up feature for the alarm sound, pretty neat.  One minor complaint: setting the alarm seems needlessly complicated, just too many steps, although being able to set a standard Mon - Fri alarm and another for weekends is a neat feature.  I'd buy one again, just not crazy about the alarm setting process.  If you are absolutely helpless when it comes to tech things, this is probably not the clock radio for you, otherwise, thumbs up."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I wanted a clock radio with presets and both AM and FM bands. That turned out to be harder to find than one would think, and the Sangean fits the bill. But I wish the user interface was simpler. Too many of the buttons have context dependent meaning, and the fancy fade-in alarm is nice, but should not be the only option. I just want it to turn on the radio at a specific time and leave it on until I tell it to turn off."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Much better reception and overall sound quality than any Sony product. A little more expensive but well worth it. AM Radio reception is noticeably better than a large C Crane unit we bought that was billed as having superior reception... BUT.. This cost less  than half what the C Crane cost."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: best alarm clock I ever had and I'm nearing the big 60. Well worth the price and the gradually increasing alarm feature is great"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Was very surprised that such a little box could produce decent sound. Granted it is not stereo FM but for a bathroom radio I didn't need a complete 7 channel system. We use the countdown timer more than any function. Was also amazed that we could pull in any of the station we wanted with just the little wire running along the back of the counter."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The Sangean RCR-5 Digital AM\/FM Clock Radio was exactly what I was looking for at a price that is very affordable.  The radio takes up little space, the clock has a lighted face which is easy to read and the reception is excellent.  In just three words, I love it!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I've been looking for a basic AM FM clock radio for a while now.  The first one I ordered (a Sony cube) was defective so I had to return it.  The second one I tried was a  HMDX Jam Zzz and it was ONLY FM!!! (which I didn't realize). Who makes an only FM radio??? So I tried this one.  It seemed from the review that it would be good, but I was very disappointed.  First, the sound quality was pretty bad and second, the volume control only worked some of the time.  Also, the display is a backlit display, not an LCD, so it wasn't all that readable when I put it to the dimmer setting (so it wouldn't be so bright at night).  So, I had to return this one, too.  I ended up with a Timex, which is working fine.  My only complaint with it is that the display, even on the dim setting, is very bright.  Why is it so hard for them to get this right???  By the way, if you only want FM, the Jam Zzz has amazing sound quality."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I bought this hoping that since it was digital I could pick up more channnels at the office. Although I expected the building to block some stations the reception was not what I was looking for."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this about a  month ago. I was looking for a bedside radio that could pull in stations in an apartment building. My previous radio only received one station clearly.\nThis little radio is a good deal. I can adjust the wire antenna in my room and pull in a number of stations. The quality of the sound is good for such a small item, and the adjustable light for the clock works well. I like the alarm options--2 alarms, can set for days of the week  and\/or weekends only. Overall, I am very pleased with this little radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This review will not describe the alarm features  I merely wanted a radio for my bathroom with quality sound that didn't drift; and it had to be compact and relatively inexpensive.  After going through the ordeal of looking for the impossible I chose the Sangean RCR-5 Digital AM\/FM Clock Radio, but I kept my expectations at a minimum.  As I removed the clock radio from the well packed box, my first impression was quite positive simply by its heft.  As soon as I set it up, which was simple, and began using the controls, I knew this was a finely-crafted piece of workmanship.\n\nIt's compact size was perfect for the limited space I had reserved, and the flavescent display is clearer and easier to read in light than I had anticipated.  But the sound is amazing for such an inexpensive radio.  Believe it or not, compared to a $500 Bose, I'll take the Sangean!  In comparison, the Bose is muffled, whereas the sound quality of the Sangean is so pure I can hear the lyrics of nearly every song played  even the insipid lyrics *G*.  The fact that the Sangean RCR-5 Digital AM\/FM Clock Radio gets any reception in my house is remarkable because our other radios don't come in clearly, and we barely get cell service (two different things, but we live in some reception black hole).\n\nWhat I thought might likely be a return has pleasantly surprised me to the extent that I am going to purchase another for my husband.  He may be able to hook it up to his electronic drum set and use it for practice.  And if he can't, I'll have a great radio in my den to replace the nasty one that's in there now."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: good radio reception. the orange is so ugly and awful to look at. returning it. i am surprised more people don't comment on the ugly orange glow."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This clock radio was easy to set up and is able to tune in stations that I've found difficult to pin down on other radios. Great features, and amazing sound for such a tiny unit. My only complaint (and the reason that I didn't give it five stars) is that the buttons up top are all sort of the same--it's hard to distinguish one from the other in a way that makes it easy to work them by \"feel\", which is something that is really helpful on a radio one is likely to be fumbling with in the dark. Moving some of the \"setting\" buttons over onto the side or back of the unit, and giving the nap, snooze, and sleep timer buttons a distinctive shape\/and feel would make this pretty much the world's most perfect clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I just needed an inexpensive, little, basic radio for my desk with at least three presets for my favorite stations.  The sound is very good.  For my needs, it is perfect."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: its very tricky setting up but once you get it working its great. Hold onto the manual if you have daylight savings, etc.\nAlso the radio quality is very good"}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Nice build quality.  Good radio tuner.  But the backlight lights up the room at night, which is real problem if its on your nightstand.  Also, numbers were hard to read compared with standard red or green displays.  I think Sangean uses the backlight to differentiate itself, but in this case the backlight is functionally much worse than standard methods."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The clock radio is great, everything is well thought out and the sound is excellent except for one thing. When you try to see the time at night it is hard to read, apparently the display needs some light to make the display show up properly"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Now that my favorite conservative radio talk shows have been banished from FM to AM, I really thought this radio would be worthless.  But to my surprise, it works on AM just perfectly in the basement, with tons of computer equipment around.  I love it!!!!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I purchased this to replace my Sony clock radio as at night it was not pulling in and holding my favorite FM stations  Wow, the Sangean is terrific. I am receiving the FM loud and clear and, for a small radio, the speaker is quite good, both in volume and fidelity.  However, be clear, it is not a Bose.  One hint, I was even able to improve the reception by attaching the radios small wire antenna  to an old small FM antenna I had left over from something or other and placed it on my window sill above my night stand with the radio.  A hanger would probably do as well, if needed.  So, overall I am delighted with this really fine product."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: This is the most complicated alarm system I have ever delt with.  The alarm goes off in the middle of the night for no apparent reason.  Does not go off for the times I had it set for.  Total loss of confidence in the product."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: A very nice little package, and with the rare headphone jack option it suits our usage .  The display characters\/background  colour  does not work as well for our aging eyes as other devices we've had but all other functions especially tuning precision are very good.\nWe hope the little On\/ Off press button switch proves to be durable over time as it is the most worked control for us!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Rather user unfriendly in the setting mode.\nAlso Saturday and Sunday alarm settings are not separate so you have to wake up at the same time both days.\nThe time is hard to read both in the dark and daylight.\nStill good enough to keep and not return."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Just got this radio yesterday & wanted to add something I did not see in the reviews. While you can dim the display (knob underneath the radio), the time annoyingly shows the seconds counting up, so the display is constantly catching your eye with the changing numbers. The illustration doesn't show seconds, and I can't find any way to shut them off. The sound is also fairly cheap, as is the case...but it does have good reception and flexible alarms. Not the same quality as the clock radio I had which finally died, but it is the typical cheap Chinese quality of everything these days..."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: i purchased this clock radio to replace a lower quality one in terms of sound.  the reviews that said it has good clear sound are misleading.  i had the same amount of static as the cheaper radio.  insult to injury i had to spend $10.00 to return the unit.  not a happy camper at all."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: We mainly use ours for a radio and it has outstanding sound quality and reception (in our area), I never knew AM could sound this good. I think the time is super easy yo set. I didn't crack the manual for anything. The display is easily dimmed with a knob on the bottom. I'm not sure what others are complaining about."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent radio, I wanted this one because it has an in-jack for ear head phones-not too many radios have that feature now.very good sound, with no drifting once the stations are set, bright lite, small and compact..."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: This clock radio functions very well.  The sound quality is very good.  The alarm setting works well.  However,  we are unable to set the date and time.  After following the steps to set the date\/time, the changed settings are not saved.  The initial setting of year was 2013.  We tried to change the year to 2014 but that value is never saved.  There are no instructions for contacting the manufacturer about this problem."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Sangean has won my heart in the small radio department. I already have a small radio for the kitchen and one for the bathroom. This one, like the others, produces a clear sound and its controls are easy to use. It sits next to my bed, and where my previous two clock radios barely tuned in the classical music station here in Houston, this one has no problem bringing in a clear signal. Because it's small, don't expect big sound, but I think  you'll be pleased with the range of the sound it produces. I love it and recommend it without qualification."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I own both this model and the Sangean K-200 (and this review is cross-posted). The K-200 has superior sound quality and a smaller footprint on a bedside table, but this model is better in nearly every other way that's important to me; it's so much better that the K-200 got demoted to our office\/sewing room and I now use this one as my daily alarm clock and go-to radio. Here's my take on why the RCR-5 is much easier to use...\n(1) Physical raised buttons for on & off and preset-changes. The RCR-5's buttons are easy to feel in the dark and work great. The K-200 has those flush under-the-skin membrane buttons and they do NOT work well; to the point that I have to press the on & off button several times to get it to work. So frustrating, especially when trying to turn off an alarm quickly -- I just gave up on snoozing it entirely.\n(2) Amber backlit display. This is SO critical for a good night's sleep if this alarm clock is going in your bedroom. Blue light triggers the \"awake time\" chemicals in our brains and amber light triggers the \"sleepytime\" ones; I found the K-200's blue glow to be difficult to fall asleep next to. I have a much easier time falling asleep with the RCR-5's amber light by my bed instead.\n(3) Weekday alarm. Both Sangean models offer this awesome feature (set an alarm to ring at the same time only on weekdays), but the RCR-5 is much easier to set. The K-200 makes you use the tuning dial to set the alarms (turn, then push to set), and it's hard to advance to the next thing without throwing your current setting off with an accidental twist of the dial as you push.\n(4) Fade-in alarm. Love this feature, both for the easy wake-up for myself and because it makes it easier for me to snooze or turn off the alarm before waking my husband earlier than necessary. RCR-5 has it, K-200 does not.\n(5) Volume set for alarms. One of the things you can set per alarm on the RCR-5 is the volume it will turn on to -- this is FABULOUS!! With the K-200, you have to physically turn the volume knob to the level you want the radio to turn on to in the morning; this is a pain if you also listen to the radio at a louder volume during the day. Or if you have a toddler...see below...\n(6) Volume control is a wheel on the side of the RCR-5, not a big glowy dial on the front (as it is on the K-200). This is particularly important if you have a toddler in the house! With the K-200, my daughter would wander by and randomly crank the volume all the way up while the unit was off, just to play with the big fun dial...so the next time I turned it on, BLASTING SOUND! Ouch. I finally learned to turn down the volume before turning the K-200 on, but it was a hard-won lesson. The much more subtlety-placed wheel on the RCR-5 doesn't look like a shiny toy, so she hasn't messed with it yet. Hooray.\nAll in all, the RCR-5 has the best functions & features of any clock radio I've ever had. I wish it had the nicer sound of the K-200, but the RCR-5 just works better for me in every other way."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Alarm features work well.  However, I had to cement a felt dot in front of the \"nap\" button so that my wife would not accidently mistake it in the dark for a station preset button.  It would have been nice if the AM loop-stick antenna could be rotated w\/o rotating the radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent sound. Straight forward to set up. Small, similarly shaped buttons are hard to differentiate by touch. Small footprint is great, adjustable brightness is useful."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Compact; okay sound; easy settings.  I wouldn't rave about any features on this, but it's a good solid product that does what it sets out to do, with minimal fuss and at a reasonable price.  I use it in the laundry room so I can't judge it as an alarm clock, but it does dim itself very nicely so I imagine it's easy to live with from that standpoint."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This is a good product. The alarm feature is excellent. The overall build quality of the case is cheap. The audio quality is just OK. I am comparing this to the Boston acoustics clock radio that I have which is superior in every way. Unfortunately, Boston Acoustics no longer makes clock radios."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This was a surprise gift for my wife - she loves it.\nThe display is very readable and all her stations have great reception.\nI programmed the stations for her and she has easily master how to operate the radio including the sleep timer.\nWe have not used the alarms function yet. When you are retired you rarely needed an alarm."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Happy to find this radio. It's difficult to find a radio with a headphone jack nowadays. I use it with a pillow speaker. The only problem is the digital light is very bright. Wish it had a dimmer. I covered the front with a piece of dark window tinting film. That did the trick."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I just got this and set it up. The controls are really intuitive, and the sound from this thing is much better than I expected!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Sounds wonderful for such a small radio. Replaces my old workhorse that finally gave up after 20+ years.  I don't like that you have to go through hoops in setting...it sequences as opposed to being able to flip a switch and do just one setting.  Other than that, thus far it works.  I like the low volume alarm getting louder as it doesn't jar you awake.  If they could make setting simpler (and the on-off button a bit larger to differentiate it from the other) it would be 5 stars."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Good radio and, the instructions aren't as difficult as some make out. The digital tuner does well in our neck of the woods.  Our previous dial-modulated clock radio was challenging to say the least.  Only drawback to this unit that we've encountered is that we'd like to be able to increase the snooze time to something beyond 5 minutes.  I guess we need to get away from that snooze game that a lot of us like to play. ;)  All in all a good choice."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: Clock had to be returned because it was so complicated to set I almost my mind trying to set the time`-date -month and year!!\nDon't purchase unless you are gifted in electronics!!!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I needed a radio with an ear jack for my bedroom ( a feature which is becoming increasingly hard to find).  I needed a radio with a sleep timer.  This radio filled both needs, with the added ability of dimming the light at night. I'm very pleased with it, even thought about buying another for that time down the road when I'll need another radio for my bedroom. . ."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great product.  Looks and feels like a quality clock radio.  Despite what some other reviews say, it's easy to setup and change features.  Took 15 minutes to browse the manual, unpack and plug in, then set the date\/time and 5 FM presets and both alarms.  I use alarm 1 for the weekdays and alarm 2 for the weekend.  The manual isn't always the best (English is not the writer's first language) but just a little common sense makes setting up or adjusting this product no problem at all.  And the sound is the best I've ever had from a clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very easy to operate and the sound from the radio are rich and full. A bit more expensive that the typical clock radio but I purchased it for the reception and sound of the radio and I wasn't disappointed."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent clock and excellent features.  However the amber background makes it impossible to read the time from a distance, but sitting on the nightstand next to the bed, it can be read quite easily.  Reception is great especially with the light off."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great looking radio - works great with my soundbar....very clear FM!\n\nTake note voltage of the adaptor is 110V.  Odd that it isn't an adaptor with auto-switching voltage."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I'm very happy with the clock radio. Good sound, lots of options.\nSetting the alarm could be made a bit easier, it just takes a while to learn the steps."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Okay radio.  Poor sound quality.  Clock light is very bright but when turned down to a lower level of brightness you can not read the time..  Finish is glossy which leaves finger prints on radio when pressing buttons.  Like the fixed radio stations but disappointed in overall quality of radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This was a really nice clock radio, I liked so many of the features and the quality of the manufacturing was noticeable.  But ultimately, I had to return it for a couple of reasons:\n1.  The display was just too bright for me, although you can adjust it, because it's backlit you have to turn it up so high in order to see the numbers that it was like a night-light in the room at night.\n2.  The sound quality of the radio was badly muffled.\n3.  The Snooze was only 5 minutes, and really doesn't allow you to get a satisfying extra bit of time, my last clock was 9 minutes.  4.  When the radio goes off in the morning, it only stays on for about 30 minutes, I may have missed that setting, but it just isn't long enough for me to get ready while listening to the radio.\n5.  Operation was not intuitive, I eventually figured things out, but using for two weeks, I still didn't feel like I understood how to use it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a very nice alarm radio for the price, Its easy to set, has multiple day options and sounds fine for a small radio.  The display is easily customized.  But a 10 minute battery backup doesn't make any practical sense. I'm keeping it for use in a place that doesn't require alarms being backed up.  A complaint is a gift."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This radio\/alarm clock believes the year is  2013 and will not let me change it to 2014, no matter how many times I try. As a result, the days are always off and I cannot set the alarm using the \"Monday through Friday\" option because it will go off on Tuesday through Saturday. That is, if it goes off at all, which it sometimes doesn't. Then I have to rely on my dog to wake me up. She is very reliable about doing so, but her times are a little erratic. As a result this alternative  does not ensure that I get to school on time to teach my classes. I really don't like this alarm clock."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I returned it. The clock light is so bright that it was like having a lamp on next to the bed. The sound is very poor and the setting of the time and alarms very difficult!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: As the title states, this is the PERFECT alarm clock!\n\nThis alarm clock takes care of the simple thing that all other manufacturers seem to ignore. My major grip, but I could overlook it with the soft alarm function, is that the minimum volume level is 3, why?! I can fix that easily blocking the speaker (shouldn't have to) and the other features outweigh this loss heavily. The only other feedback I would have is it would be nice to have \"nature\" sounds - only because I got used to that on my last one and it beats radio commercials first thing in the morning.\n\nWhat makes this perfect? I have been plagued with trying to add tint to displays that have been too bright (ultimately turning them off so I could actually sleep, having to use my cell phone to check the time at night). I also find myself trying to make the sound softer, I don't know why people want to make alarm clocks that put on a concert. I am a light sleeper, I don't need that. I could go on...\n\nDimming - I was so close to wanting to \"design\" my own alarm clock, modifying something existing (thinking I could market it since this target is always missed). The dimming feature on this is absolutely amazing for something so simple. Want full brightness? Turn the dial (potentiometer) all the way up? Want it dim? Limitless adjustability to zero backlight. PERFECTION!\n\nAlarm feature - set weekday, weekend, one time, etc. Perfect options, something I have missed on other alarm clock feature lists in the past leading to a return.\n\nAlarm sound - soft wake feature is great, but you also set the alarm volume with the alarm. I was afraid with the volume control on the side (digital control so it is not another potentiometer) could get bumped, but it is actually fixed to the alarm setting. Another great feature.\n\nTurning the alarm off - how many alarm clock require you to turn the light on to find the off button? Too many. There is a lit power button on the top right that disables the alarm when you want to turn it off. At first I thought this was another great feature, however, when the alarm is on this is not lit. I don't understand why. Worst case you could snooze then hit this.\n\nSetup is a breeze, never cracked the manual other than to see how to disable the alarm.\n\nFor such a simple product, many manufacturers screw this up miserably. This is, hands down, the BEST alarm clock I have ever had. The details were well thought out. You will not be disappointed with this alarm clock! I read many reviews where people are just as weird as I about alarm clocks, I wish I could forward them to them all.\n\nNow to try out the other (less important to me) features..."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Easy to follow instructions display dimmer is on the bottom only I wish was snooze was 9 or 10 minutes instead of 5. Very good reception and really like the human waking system"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent radio; I only use it for the FM Radio, not for alarms, etc.  I live away from any large city and have had difficulty with reception.  However this little radio is great, works as advertised, good reception, easy to pre-set the digital radio stations, etc.  I would recommend it."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: it's about as good as such things get in this price range.  the big advantage is the digital tuner, which is more stable than the continuous knob tuners more common in competitive radios.  the sound is adequate, not great but ok compared to similar radios.\nthe downside is the usual over-complexity & non-intuitive nature of the settings.  you need to keep the manual handy for the simplest task.  and the date setting doesn't work on my radio (but i do not need to use a radio as a calendar). unfortunately this is a widespread disease."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The clock\/radio deserves 5 stars for performance, time visiblility and compact appearance.  So, why haven't I rated it 5 stars?  Tomorrow I have to reset the time for standard time.  There are several - I'm not counting - steps to take for changing the clock.  I shouldn't complain about a task that is completed only twice a year or if there is an extended power outage.\n\nThe instruction manual is info deficient.  There is no key for some of the display symbols (choice of alarms). I'm still somewhat confused with some of the functions and am learning its useage on an ongoing basis. An example:  \"After the time is under setting, the setting won't be cancelled even you don't press any button for more than 10 seconds.\"\n\nOverall, I'm pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a clock\/radio with a soothing alarm."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Best radio for waking because of the \"humane\" system (brightness and volume increase slowly from a \"whisper\" level to loud). Very reliable. However, the yellow LCD display is very difficult to see from a distance (not enough contrast). A red LED display would be much better  (blue or green would be easy to read as well but these shorter wavelengths interfere with melatonin production). Love the simple shape and style (hate radios that have trendy, goofy shapes). Should have a battery backup built in but this can be added externally."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Read the other reviews, purchased this based on the high ratings and I agree.  Programmed alarm without reading manual.  My highest praise for ease of use.  Tone quality is decent.  ONE big complaint.  Anyone buying a plain old clock radio without Bluetooth and\/or iPod dock (pretty much all the local stores have) is probably like me, older than dirt.  Would it have been so hard to print bigger labels?  Even with my reading glasses I had to struggle to read\/interpret symbols.  Fortunately, once it's programmed, you really don't have to read the labels again."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Just what I was looking for. I like the dual alarm feature that you can set for different days. Easy to set up. I especially like that you can completely dim the light so it doesn't keep you up at night."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Impressive.  Reception was excellent for stations that are typically hard to get.  Instructions were clear.  Setting alarm could be initially confusing given the functionality of the clock; many choices and options result in a complicated set up, but easily learned.  Better separation and physical distinction among buttons would keep from accidentally hitting the wrong button\/function.  Overall, extremely pleased, so far."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I absolutely love this digital radio.  The Christian station I listen to here where I live will only pick up a digital signal.  The signal is clear and the clock is wonderful!  I would recommend this digtial radio to everyone!  I have been looking for this radio for a few years now and am so glad I finally found it!!!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Nice radio with very good reception, even AM. On\/off ...just press button. Easy. Have not used alarm...bought as a bathroom radio.  Only complaint is you can't adjust tone.  Could use a little treble on  FM band."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The music does not get loud enough to wake me up in the morning. I have left it on for close to half hour and it is still very low."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Reasonable price for a radio of this type, however the Sangean has a few serious shortcomings. For starters the display is hard to read except when it is set up to almost maximum brightness, however then it is like a nightlite in a dark bedroom, so a dimmer setting is a must, and then it is hard to read. The alarms are complex to set up. It took me half an hour to get there. Finally the sound is kind of at the base end of the spectrum. I was OK with this as my high frequency hearing is not great, however I found it sounding distorted at low volume making talk difficult to understand, especially  deeper male voices. I hoped to upgrade it for one with larger speakers, but the seller told me I had to return it unopened and within 10 days. Unfortunately they told me this one after I tried it. So both from the point of view of quality and service (BidDeal is the seller) I cannot recommend either. Sorry."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio met my expectations and needs with one exception.  One cannot change the volume level when the radio is off.  So if I want to lower the volume before turning it on late at night, turning the volume wheel will not change the level from where it was set the last time the radio was playing.  It is only possible to adjust the volume after the radio is powered on.\nOtherwise it is fine for my needs: compact size, powerful enough speaker on top is easy to hear (as long as you don't put anything on top of it), reception is fine, several presets available, sleep mode, alarm - all satisfactory."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was looking for a clock radio, didn't really care about the alarm features (though this one has two).  This clock radio turned out to be exactly what I wanted.  I wanted preset buttons (this has 5).  I wanted AM and FM bands (this clock radio has them).  The presets are programmable as you would expect (push and hold and the preset remembers the station).  The presets access the stations as you would expect (push the button, you're there).  Good reception, both AM and FM.  The unit has a heavy, solid feel to it.  Extremely easy to set up.  It would be nice if it had battery backup, but considering all the other nice features it offers, I'd just as soon hook up a DieHard to maintain the memory!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Nice clock. I primarily purchased for the rare feature of an earphone jack. A little less intuitive for alarm setting than expected. I was a little worried since it was a less known brand, but works well so far. Dimmer on background light is nice."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: after trying and returning several other clock radios, we decided that this one came closest to the features we were looking for in a clock radio. i really like the feature of being able to sent up an alarm to only go off during the week so that it is set it and basically forget it. it is by far the easiest one to program of the several that we had tried. it has the feature of the alarm starting soft and then building up, and unlike several others that we tried with that feature, you could set the limit of the volume that would be eventually reached by the alarm. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is that the sound quality of the radio portion is not very good in my opinion. my old clock radio that i had for over 25 years had a better sound quality than this one but i guess you can't have everything."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: This is a nice little radio. Very good sound quality for the price.  However, it is ridiculously difficult to change from FM to AM.  Decided to pre-select only FM stations and disregard capability to listen to AM on this unit."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I wanted a digital tuner, I listen to some weak-signaled stations in my area and my old clock radio with an analog tuner could not pick them up.  I also like the \"humane\" alarm, starts low enough for you to hear but not so loud you practically soil yourself in the morning."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Some quick notes on things that may not be obvious:\n\n1.  Unit is much smaller than it appears in the pictures.  Display is large and bright and easy to read, though.\n2.  The alarms have lots of control.  You can set it for only certain days (weekdays, weekends, every day), you also set the radio station and volume level as part of the alarm, so it can be something different than what you were last listening to.\n3.  On the negative side, setting alarms is rather complicated, and it's not obvious how to temporarily disable an alarm for one day (say, if you wake up early and don't want it to go off and wake up your spouse\/partner).\n4.  Radio reception for me was fine.  The NPR pledge drive came in loud and clear.  Voices sound much better than on my 10 year old Sony clock radio.  But it is a clock radio, not a component stereo system."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Difficult to set and reset.  Have to keep instruction book handy.  Backup for power outages is not very long and backlight is bright, not good for those who like it dark for sleeping.  The only redeeming features are that the time is very easy to read and the alarm comes on quietly and can be turned off before it gets loud."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: This radio was ok for the first few years but most of the alarm and radio station buttons started malfunctioning after 5ish years.  Pretty unfortunate for an expensive clock."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Looed for a long time to find this digital baby but worth all the time it took to find it.  Use it only as a kitchen radio. Glad I looked until I found this one!!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Perfect clock for my bedroom only the backlighting of it is not perfect for me. The light is very bright but as you dim it (thank goodness you are able to do this) the numbers become a bit harder to read. I love it and will learn to live with it. I only use it as a clock so can't speak to its other functions."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Radio is much to complicated, I have not been able to get the time to work, the alarm wants to go off every day, the sound quality is not good.  You could get better performance out of a lot cheaper clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am very pleased with the sound quality of this unit. They actually put a good quality speaker in there, and that's exactly what I was looking for. Decent sound without taking up too much space on the night stand. I'm not thrilled with the display, but it works fine. There is a knob on the bottom of the unit that allows you to adjust the brightness of the LCD backlight to make it as dim or as bright as you would like. I prefer the old-fashioned LED displays, personally, but it's hard to find those these days, especially combined with good sound. So, I have no regrets about buying this unit."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I really looked for along time to replace my clock radio. This is perfect. I love the feature where I can plug in earphone and have my music turn off automatically after I have drifted off to sleep. If you want to use it for an alarm clock you have to unplug the earphones. Quality and size are exactly right. Dimmer makes sure light is not disturbing."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This has many hard to find features, audio out and sleep timer for radio, and a nap feature that is really easy to use. This is the best clock radio I've ever had."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: What a great little radio. It gets wonderful reception and that fact that we can preset the stations is a plus. I would highly recommend it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I purchased this radio primarily as an alarm clock and a digital tuner.  On both these counts the radio performs very well.  The alarm is set for radio and the music gently increases in amplitude until it reaches its set volume (nice).  The tuner is excellent and does not drift like analog tuners (which I had before). (Most alarm radio tuners are analog unless they state digital tuner.) There is no static with this digital tuner.  The sound is very crisp and clear.\n\nSome downsides.  (1) The lighted dial is bright.  Since my bed is below the clock, this does not bother me.  On the other hand, if you are not level to the clock, you cannot read the time. (2) It takes some time to get used to the navigation features including turning the alarm setting on or off.  Instructions are not great, -adequate.\n\nIf this clock had an adjustable lighted screen, it would get another 1-2 stars."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Sound quality is great, much better than any other radio or stereo system I've had.  It's a small unit (about 6 inches wide), fits on a nightstand.  Numbers are small and backlit- Can't see the time from across the room.  Snooze is only 5 minutes, and the controls to reset the alarm are difficult to figure out in the dark."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: one thing no one mentions is it has very good fm reception with only that little built in fm antenna, was able to place it in prime real estate in my bedroom where only the strong survive. was very amaze it could pull in very hard to get classical station where so many others failed, def. a great buy, pretty good sound also"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Nice radio lots of features. My problem with it is the selection of radio or beeper. I wanted the radio sound for wake up but I get the beeper sound. I think I got it right maybe 4 times out of 60 tries with careful following of the sequence. I tried using the < and > on the bar key and select and also without <\/> and select so its been mostly a miss :( Still a mystery to this day. And that beeper sound, my brain has recorded and I hear it over and over in my head all day long, can't get it out."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a very good little clock radio.  The feature set is excellent and the radio pulls in distant signals well.  The only drawbacks are that the display is hard to read in total darkness, and the sound is a little thin due to the fact that it has just a single 3\" speaker (or thereabouts).  All that said, this is an excellent value; this unit is clearly superior to all others in this price range."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I was looking for a clock radio that was able to get good radio reception. This Sangean does that very well. I also liked the small size so it doesn't take up much room on my nightstand. It seems to be well made, also.\n\nBut there were two things I did not like about it so I returned it.\n\nI did not like the display with dark numbers on a bright gold background. The background is adjustable but when I made it dim enough to not bother me at night, it was very difficult to read the time. I much prefer bright numbers on a black background.\n\nAlso, it took me several tries to figure out how to set it to wake me to radio instead of alarm. The display icons are very tiny and a bit confusing since the instruction book did not describe that the \"bell\" was for alarm and the \"megaphone-looking-thingy\" was for radio.\nI tried it out for several days before deciding this is just not right for me."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It's great! It is well made, like the Sangean shower radio that I also have. You can turn the display illumination all the way off, a feature that I like since I'm sensitive to light at night. For a small clock radio the sound is quite acceptable, better than other small radios that I've had. The buttons and switches are better than the usual junk quality you find in small radios.  It allows you to set each of the two alarms to apply to all 7 days, or just the weekends, or just M-F. This means that I can set the alarm and forget it. No longer will I be awakened Saturday morning because I forgot to turn off the alarm Friday night. The radio alarm volume control is programmed separately from the normal listening volume (on a per alarm basis), another user friendly feature.  It really seems to be a nicely engineered product.\n\n6\/6\/2017: And it still is working perfectly!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I've been looking for a clock radio like this for a while - surprised that it took so long, but it seems that there are a lot of ones out there but none were what I was looking for. I wanted a basic black radio with a screen that could be readable but not too bright. The screen brightness is adjustable. I have it set to wake me up to NPR each morning - which doesn't always work because I sometimes stay in bed to listen to the news story:). A cool feature is that the volume starts out low and gradually gets louder so you don' t have to worry about being startled out of sleep."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: My 81-year-old father-in-law began complaining that his 25 year old analog AM\/FM clock radio was no longer picking up his favorite local country music station that he needs to listen to all night while sleeping.  He asked me to help him find something newer.  I read the reviews about this radio on Amazon and decided to give it a try.\n\nThe radio easily picks up his FM radio station now, along with many others he could not receive on his previous clock radio.  Plus this one is simple to use for changing stations and setting up pre-sets.  (It has lots of other nice features, but my father-in-law won't try to use any of them; as long as he can hear his country music all night while sleep, he's happy.)\n\nI like the appearance of the display, too.  (The only negative is that the display brightness control is on the bottom of the radio; how stupid is that?)  I also like that it has an external FM antenna that is not incorporated into the power cord.\n\nOverall, I believe this is a good quality clock radio at an affordable price."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love these radios, this is my third one.  First off, this is a small unit best for personal listening near your chair or on a nightstand.  Don't expect room filling sound.  But at reasonable volume levels the sound is exactly the way I like it, articulate and clear.  Best of all, this radio is not grossly bass heavy like the Tivoli Audio and the Bose.  Once you become familiar with the controls and settings they are easy to set.  The first one I bought  has been running continuously out in the garage for about ten years now so they seem to be reliable.\n\nI may just be lucky, but I get all of my favorite AM and FM stations very well.  Experiment with the location of the FM antenna wire.  And with the AM reception it helps if there are no other wall warts or AC\/DC transformers on the same 110 volt circuit.  I have my main music system and other bedroom devices on a surge protector with an on\/off switch.  So on those occasions when I listen to AM, like sporting events,  I just click off the surge protector and this cleans up the AM reception on the little radio.\n\nThis is my first one in black and it is certainly very stylish.  But the white one doesn't show the dust and cat hair as much.  Just something to consider.\n\nUPDATE:  I just received another one of these radios for use by the pool.  The AM stations were mostly static and I could only get two FM stations at all.  I plugged it into an outlet in the house and it worked perfectly.  The problem, warts......wall warts.  If you are having reception problems it could be because you have other AC\/DC transformers (wall warts) on the same circuit as the radio.  Try the radio on a different circuit and see what happens."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Bought this alarm clock through Amazon a year ago and still love it! I needed a good alarm clock because my cell phone just wasn't cutting it but was not enthused by any of the alarms at Walmart, Target, etc. They either looked ok but had no features (like dual alarms, AUX input, etc) or, if they did have those features, they were ugly as hell -giant ridiculous looking things with way too many buttons and a cluttered display. So I started checking them out on here.. I was becoming discouraged as it seemed that most of the alarms with features that also looked nice were waaay expensive ..until I found this one. I loved that it was sleek, simple (aesthetically), and had everything I needed.\nIt's been a year now and I still love this alarm clock! When I tidy up the bedroom and make the bed, I still look over at it and think, \"damn, that's a nice looking alarm clock.\" :)\n\nPros:\n-Looks great\n-All of the necessary features (for me anyway!)\n-The amber color display (its so pleasant)\n\nCons:\n-I had to change the time for one of the alarms a few months ago and couldn't, for the life of me, remember\/figure out how to change it.. I had to pull the manual back out. So I guess it may not be the most intuitive programming. Or, most likely, I'm just getting old.\nI honestly can't think of any other negatives for this thing!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Love this radio. Signal is strong and has a crisp sound. Alarm goes off softly at first and then gradually gets louder. I'm very happy with this purchase. Well worth the money."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The unit has the outstanding sound That I was expecting. I am having difficulty changing the settings on the alarm system.  I will not give up."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Took some learning to sort out the control buttons\/features, but keeps the stations tuned very well (one distant station always seemed to fade out half the time on my old\/analog clock radio).  Worth the price!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Sound is okay.  Operation is not user friendly.  Tried using in the bedroom but buttons are not all logical.  Has been relegated to the garage."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I was looking for a radio with and earphone jack and this  was the one!\nNow I feel like a jerk should have read more.\nI leave in the northeast, during the winter months we loose our power frequently for periods of one to four hours.\nThere is NO Battery Backup!!!!!\nWhy the hell would a company make a clock radio with an alarm and NO BATTERY BACKUP.\nThis purchase was a Huge Mistake for me."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: PRO:\nGood volume on the radio\nStations come in nice.\nLove the buzzer to wake you up.  Starts out nice and quiet, gets louder and louder.  Eases you awake instead of jolting\n  you.  Very effective (believe it or not) and also a nice (r) way to wake up\nTwo alarm times\nCan be set to standard or military format\nCan show the year, month, and day\n\nCon:\nNo seek\/scan button.  Have to go through everything individually\nOnly 5 memory buttons\nCOMPLICATED!!! Will raise your blood pressure just trying to set this thing.  Even once you get the hang of it.\nTook me 3 days just to program the time, and another person to tell me how to set the alarm.  Not good for some one who doesn't know their way around electronics or isn't patient.  Once you get it working, it's great."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Love everything about this clock radio except it doesn't have a battery back up. Living in the northeast, with regular power outages, I have to reset it by hand each time. Also, have to have a back up alarm in inclement weather."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a GREAT-NEWS-O-GRAM!!\n\nI ordered an RCR-5 after doing an amazing amount of research (other competing products, etc.), still\nnot completely sure that I'd get the NO FRILLS, sleep-timer, head-phone jack, good reception, presets\nproduct I was after.................\n\nI received it, and have used it for a couple weeks........she's a WONDERFUL value......EXACTLY what\nI wanted.......and Sangean the ONLY team that brings such an animal to market.  I have no idea yet about\nthe durability over time.......some consumer comments about buttons that stop working....who knows what\nthe future will bring?........but it SEEMS solid enough, and at this price, even if  by low-percentage chance\nI got a lemon.......I'd probably go right back out and buy ANOTHER ONE!\n\nHere's what I LIKE:  the no-frills basic functions mentioned above\n  the shiny-smooth plastic finish (I got white)\n  the small size and clean lines, easy to handle\n  the simple controls\n  the sound quality, both AM and FM come in clearly and not tinny, in a\n  major metro area\n  and AMAZON, as usual under-promised and OVER-DELIVERED, processing and delivery were flawless and EARLY!\n\nHere's what IRRITATES:\n  the numerals and face (black against back-lit orange)\n\nSangean was flirting with PERFECTION, but just had to crap it up with this rinky-dink system!!\nColor me disappointed..........IF the numerals were LCD or LED in blue with a darker background,\nthe unit would be easier to read, without any complaint of too much light at night, and it would look\nalot sexier......I would have bought another unit immediately for the other side of the bed\nif this were the design, but as it is, I may wait for a \"new and improved\" thing.\n\nOverall, THIS IS A WINNER......Sangean ought to be PROUD of their product......I'm sure they've brought happiness\n  and enjoyment to multitudes!......reminds me of the way Samsung dominates TV."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Good reception. Quick set up.  Reasonable tone quality. MOST IMPORTANT: It's easy to switch stations; now I no longer have to endure listening to endless\/obnoxious\/fact-defying commercials!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is the second of these that I've bought. Very good, clear sound; I really like being able to use the preset buttons instead of hunting for stations with a dial tuner or having to scan.\nThese were very easy to set up and they are easy to use. This is a great product at a good price."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love this clock radio.  Digital tuner works great.  We live pretty far out from major cities with radio stations.  Clock radios that we've had in the past haven't picked up the station we want (NPR).  But this one has no problems.  It has 2 different alarms to set.  You can even set each alarm for different stations.  It's easy to set and re-set.  The only drawback is the display.  With the lit background and black numbers it can be hard to see at night, half asleep, with glasses off."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Looks nice but you can't see the numbers at night.  The light on the clock washed the numbers out and you just can't see it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Battery backup is only 10 minutes. So if you have an important appointment in the morning, you should likely set your phone or alarm that has a real battery that can last for a longer time , should you have a power outage. This is the main drawback of this unit, the battery is built in so you can't do a thing about the short backup time.\n\nOtherwise I like that everything is digital with radio presets."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent sound. Everything works as expected. Only (minor) conmplaint: like other reviewers, I would have liked a brighter display of time, station #, etc. to offset that yellow background light."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews but this clock radio has exceeded expectations. Was easy to set up, brightness is completely controllable and the color of the back light much better than the clock I was replacing. Radio reception is great and even stations that won't come in on my stereo tune in on this. The gradual volume increase on the alarm makes the wake up process much more pleasant!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: After 4 tries to obtain an AM\/FM radio that had the sensitivity to pick up the stations we wanted to listen to in the kitchen, this radio finally satisfied our requirements - right sized (small), came with antenna.  We didn't need stereo or really hi-fi like sound, Just needed to hear our favorite station and this works well. Yes, other reviews said the reception was marginal, but for us this radio does the job since it has a digital tuner it can separated out the weaker stations from the high power ones.  The radio doesn't do HD, just the basic AM\/FM."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Reception is very good in our fringe area. However, display is hard to read...  numbers are light black not red as shown in web picture. Changing brightness of back-lighing only helps a little. Disapontd"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is an excellent radio.  My radio is in my home office tucked underneath a monitor and I still get excellent reception.  The volume is more than adequate and packs some punch.  I can turn it up pretty loud and still hear it clearly even when I walk out of the room. I really like having five preset AM and five preset FM stations... which is one of the main reasons I bought this.  I like to listen to the radio while I'm working and it's nice to be able to simply press a button to listen to my favorite stations instead of having to fine tune back and forth between stations. The display is bright and easy to read.  The display feature gives the option to view the station you're listening to or go back to the time.  The size is perfect and I like the black and gray colors that allows it to blend in with everything on the desk.\n\nI'll admit that  I don't utilize the alarm at all, so I can't comment on the nap or snooze or any of those things, but I'm sure if you scroll up or down, you'll read other reviews of those features."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I love Sangean products.  This one, however, is a bit confusing.  The buttons are so close together - easy to confuse if it's dark.  I've have several times hit the \"Nap\" button unknowingly, only to be awoken 1\/2 hour later, not sure what's going on.  Poorly designed."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Perfect little radio for my bathroom. Gets great reception. With the screen on max it makes a great night light. Good sound. AUX in for my iPhone. Easy to set. Lots of options. Large screen that is easy to read."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: My husband got this desktop radio for me to use a work. It is east to set up and I like the antenna so my reception is great. I am also happy with the ability to preset stations."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Radio turned out to be a disappointment.  My wife and I enjoy waking up to the NPR station(FM).  Despite numerous attempts at positioning the FM antenna we were never able to get clean and clear reception of the station.  Ironically we use the Sangean PR-D5 radio in the bathroom right on the other side of the wall with no such reception problem for the NPR Radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Have not been put to the real test yet but the reception of radio stations seems to be the best out of any other clock radio that my wife has used."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Can't give it 5 stars, only 4 - it has virtually no battery backup. The manual states it lasts only 10 min or so from a  power failure before it loses all settings. Wish it lasted longer. But a good clock all in all. Once you get the hang of setting the alarm - it becomes a breeze. It is absolutely superb that you can fully adjust the display brightness from a turn knob on the underside of the clock. I mostly bought it for this reason. And the display is not harsh at all, I had no trouble getting to sleep"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Nice radio but had a little trouble on the reception of a few am stations.  Had to move it around for them to come in better....could be where we are...who knows?"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: For the most part, the clock works pretty well. However, when we try to update the year to 2014, it won't stay programmed that way. It's kind of odd. It's also hard to turn the ringers off; you have to press a completely different button than the ones you do to set the alarm. Setting the alarm can also bit a bit laborious."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love this clock radio. Perfect size. Looks great in black. Wonderful sound. Love that it has two programmable alarms that can be Mon-Fri, Sat\/Sun or one time. Love the sleep and nap modes. I need a male to male 3.5mm cable so add $8 but o\/w i can't express how satisfied i am. It replaced an ailing sony cd dream machine. Good riddance to that now that I have this!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: After much searching I decided on this radio.  Had trouble setting the alarm.  Finally gave up.  Whatever I did, at 6:00 am the alarm would come on.  I would turn it off and it would come on again.  Then I would unplug it.  Finally I took it to the kitchen table where I could see the face of the clock clearly and with book in hand finally figured it out.  There were more choices than I had ever seen.  So far, so good.  It is a nice clock, just read directions carefully."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is an excellent bedside radio.  I knew it was as soon as I plugged it in and started to set up, which for me can sometimes be very confusing.  Not so with this radio.  The manual is extremely clear, and it was ready to go in a jiffy.  The reception is excellent,  not usually so where I live.  It's very easy to turn on with my eyes closed when I wake up in the night, another plus.  I like it a lot."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It's a really well made device, something that's getting rare in today's disposable electronics culture.  From front angles it looks somewhat pretty, from side angles the shiny grey, plastic sides and back look utilitarian.  Not a strong choice if you are looking for decorator design.\n\nThe radio is impressive for the size and price of the unit.  Setting the radio alarm is a bit confusing, but you get used to it pretty quickly.  The volume rise feature on the alarm\/radio is nice and you can set the volume you want in the morning as a part of the alarm setting so you could have low volume music to go to sleep and have louder music to awaken.\n\nI did return the item for two reasons:\n\n1. The LCD display is hard to read in low to medium light unless you turn up the amber-colored backlight.  But if you turn it up, it will be too bright in a dark room for sleeping.  It doesn't auto switch between day and night lighting.\n\n2. It has a built in battery but it only lasts for a short time if the power goes out.  Good for momentary brownouts, but if the power drops for an hour while you sleep, you won't be getting woken up."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: VERY PLEASED WITH BOTH THE APPEARANCE AND THE CLOCK. LARGE NUMBERS AND DUAL ALARM ARE ESPECIALLY WELCOME. THE ONLY NEGATIVE IS THE POOR QUALITY OF THE RADIO. COULD BE CLEARER."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I live in the country so my previous alarm clocks just wouldn't clearly tune into a radio station. It would always be a little fuzzy. This clock is awesome & I haven't a problem. The light is a little brighter than I prefer but live the rest of the features!!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This unit was one of many I tried for a neighbor who has finger curl and issues the senior world suffers from. After trying many radios having varying features my neighbor greeted me with a big hug and a smile. She stated \" why didn't we try this one first? I love it. So, what more can I say than this is the radio for seniors or any one suffering from finger curl and wishes to easily step from one preset station to another."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Ability to save five stations is huge improvement over the antique model it replaced.\n\nDecent sound.  Alarm not too jarring.  Bought this model a few months ago for a vacation house.  Liked it so much I just bought a second one to upgrade my NYC nest."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I work in an old building that does not let FM in at all.  After 4 other desk radios I found this one!  It is the best no static! Good sound and small form factor."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This radio is compact and has a lot of nice features.  The reception is good, even the stations, on which I previously got poor reception.  I highly recommend it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: We weren't looking for anything too complicated or with more features than necessary,\njust an alarm and radio mode, does the trick for us, and this is just fine.\nGood price, fairly easy to see the display, it just works, and that's all we wanted."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I had an analog tuner before, this digital tuner is way easier. Can't see the display as good as I would like at night. And, the user manual takes a little imagination to read correctly, (translation from writer language to correct reader language)."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was looking for a smallish radio that had a headphone jack, digital tuning, some preset stations, and an audio aux input.  That particular combination turns out to be less common than I expected.  This radio only allows for 5 preset FM stations (I wish it was 2 or 3 times as many,) but It feels well constructed, has good reception and suits my purposes fine for the price.  I don't need the alarm so i don't know how well that works."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: For some reason, the white model was a bit cheaper, so I got a white one. White is also easier to see in the dark,\nso that's another consideration, even though black is \"hipper\", or something.\n\nIt has 10 (ten) total presets--5 AM, and 5 FM, which is reasonably ample.\n\nHas a very decent sound, for a small radio speaker.\n\nReception seems fairly strong.\n\nEasy to operate and understand, IMO.\nCompact size, nice lit on\/off button (lights when off) .\nVolume wheel on side, out-of-the-way, but convenient.\n\nWhat's not to like?"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: This item was returned.\n\nDifficult to set time, alarm, etc features..  LED's too bright., kept us awake.  It had good reception but the negative features out weighed keeping it."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The volume control didn't work. I purchased this product because it had an earphone jack that would enable me to use a pillow speaker with the alarm"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The back ground on the display is lit up bright and the time is very dull.  It is so hard to see what time it is.  Sending back!!!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I was looking for a decent quality clock radio with intuitive controls and, most importantly, the capacity for dimming the display.  This display has the widest range of brightnesses I've ever seen.  It can be dimmed very low, to the point where it doesn't illuminate the room (or keep me awake), yet is easily legible in the dark."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: When I needed to replace my bedroom clock radio, I first tried a more expensive radio that also would play and charge my iPhone.  Unfortunately, its FM reception was poor and so I sent it back.  I did more research and found that several reviewers said this Sangean radio had excellent reception, so I decided to give it a try.  In fact the reception was better than any other radio that I have owned during the twenty years I have lived in this house.  The sound quality also is very good for the price. The alarm works very well and once I got used to its operation, I found it easy to set.  The radio is nice looking and small enough to fit on my night table.  A minor complaint is that the brightness control for the clock is located underneath the radio.  Since I do need to dim it at night and brighten it in the morning, I have to pick it up twice a day.  I would prefer a control that is easier to access.  Overall, however, I am very pleased and recommend this to anyone who needs a basic clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Arrived on time and works as advertised.  SNOOZE length is fixed at 5 minutes but NAP length can vary from 5 minutes up to 2 hours, in 5 minute steps. I hope the next version allows for an external 9v battery backup because the internal battery backup is good for just 10 minutes during a power failure."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a nice clock radio. It's an attractive design. It sounds pretty good, considering its size. The owner's manual is easy to follow. It has a headphone jack which accepts 1\/8\" stereo headphones, but plays (in both ears) mono. It would be a bonus if the radio played through the headphone jack in stereo, so you could enjoy stereo through headphones or powered speakers. The aux input accepts stereo plugs. Seems like that design feature would not cost the company much, if anything, and would make this clock radio a much better deal."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I purchased a larger Sangean digital and was so impressed I bought the alarm clock RCR-5 for my nightable. It is good with 2 exceptions:  1. the instructions for setting the alarm are very confusing and made setting it a problem....2. the instruction book english needs to be edited to be clear. On the bright side...their customer service rep was really very good at walking me through setting the alarm...So far it is good and a pleasure to have a digital radio...the reception is a bit better as well than my old Sony."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I wanted to replace a clock radio with a pillow speaker connection which requires a sensitive touch to keep active.  This one looked too cheap to believe and it was.  The controls for both volume and tuning were inoperable as was the arlm system.  Thanks for taking it back."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The only thing good about this radio are station preset buttons.  The placement positioning of all the other control buttons is extremely poor.  The orange light is overwhelming--much too bright with no method of adjustment provided.  The overall appearance of is one of average looks and poor quality (materials used).  Performance is, at best, average.  And you get all this for an incredibly high price.  This is a CLEAR case of NOT getting what you pay for.  This product is not worth even half the price, which makes me feel like a fool for having made this purchase and being so gullible.  DO NOT repeat my mistake."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: at night when my partner is sleeping, I plug in my earphones so I don't wake her up but when I turn on the sleep timer, it makes a beep which wakes her up so I can't use the radio when I would normally always use it. I do have another one of these which doesn't do that. I like the radio and will return it for exchange and hope it doesn't beep."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It is hard to set this by touch, and the alarm went off last night.\n\nThat said, this is head and shoulders above the Jensen JCR-310 Top Loading AM\/FM PLL Stereo CD Dual Alarm Clock, that I originally bought and returned.  Good sound."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Beautiful display, nice design and easy setup...and AWESOME AM reception! I got this to listen to talk radio at night as I fall asleep, and it's perfect. I haven't used the alarm function yet because I use my phone for that. But I'm very happy with this and highly recommend it, especially if you are looking for something with great AM reception."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Pros: reception is excellent; good sound quality\n\nCon: setting the time and alarms is not easy; even after several months I keep the owner's manual handy."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I'll admit that I don't use all the features of this Clock Radio. I bought it because I wanted an AM radio next to my bed with a headphone jack. My \"bed partner\" is a very light sleeper and can't handle any noise. And I am the opposite: I sleep best with some mindless chatter from a talk radio station echoing in my head. So I wanted a) good AM reception and b) a headphone jack. This offered both.\n\nThe reception is good. I live in the middle of a large, dense city, and reception is sometimes a problem. At first, I thought the reception was mediocre on this radio, but then I stretched the power cord out to maximum, to see if it would function as an antenna. It did. Now the reception is great on all the stations I like.\n\nThe headphone jack works as it should. No complaints there.\n\nThe clock is also very easy to program. I don't use the alarm, but setting of the time was extremely intuitive, and a quick glance at the instructions made the alarm programming function look pretty much the same.\n\nThe display is nice and bright, and adjustable, which is nice.\n\nThat's about all I have to say about it. Five stars for my needs."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It gets great radio reception, and I like that you can program two different alarms (say, one for M-F and a different one for the weekend). But the snooze is every 5 minutes and can't be changed, and the buttons are crappy. You have to really mash on them a few times before anything happensnot what you want when you're trying to hit snooze."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I was tired of the poor quality radio\/alarm i've had over the years and decided to pay a little extra for this one and it was worth it. You notice the quality right out of the box. Good sound quality. All the options you would want. Quality feel. My only complaint was the way they lined all the buttons up in a row and you have to always look or memorize which buttons do what. If you are looking for quality this is the one."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I mistakenly bought this clock because I thought it would stay in contact with a satellite and automatically reset itself. (The instruction manual is so sketchy that I STILL might be mistaken!) It's attractive, and the black-on-orange time is easy to read. The sound is good on the radio settings, noticeably muffled when I listen to an MP3 player on AUX. I like that a ten-minute backup battery comes with the clock. I would buy a Sangean again -- but next time I'd shop more carefully."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I recently reviewed this clock-radio from Sangean and approved its functions.  However, since that time, I have noticed that a wrong day\/date of week was being displayed.  I and my husband tried several times to correct day\/date but without success!  Day\/Date kept changing back to its previous settings!  And...without being able to set time\/day\/date, I am unable to set the 'alarm clock'!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Setting the dual alarms seems unnecessarily complicated.  Otherwise I've experienced no other problems. Unit is compact requiring only a small amount of space on the bedside stand, a desirable feature."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love the sound quality of this radio. I listen to mostly talk shows and the spoken word comes across as very clear, crisp and warm.  The backlight is orange and I wish I could change it.  It really stands out against the white case (you can dim the backlight, but only so much).  Button placement could have been better designed.  For example, the on\/off button is awkwardly placed behind the band button.  But on the whole I am very pleased with this purchase."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is the one to have if one wants a very good bedside radio.  Good audio for its size, very easy to program.  The only minor problem I have is that the battery in not replaceable and only holds memory for 5 minutes if unplugged."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This little clock radio is the perfect addition to the kitchen.  The styling is sleek, the sound quality is quite good, and operating instructions are simple."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: I didn't give this a 5 star because it has its problems in programing.  The radio, clock and most features work as designed.  There has been a problem getting it to stay on the correct date.  It programs the correct date until you return to the run mode and it goes to yet another year and day of the week.  The radio is great and the sleep mode for what I purchased it for rates a 5 but can't give it for the other reasons."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio is just what i was looking for. It looks nice and my mother needded an easy to use digital radio and she is really happy"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Many reviewers complained about the bright light on the face, but it caused us no problems.  I especially like the buttons for different stations.  The alarm system takes a like while to learn, but works fine."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I got this clock because I wanted presets.  My old Sony worked fine but tuning was so difficult I usually kept in one one station.  This has 5 AM and 4 FM presets and digital tuning.  Unfortunately the FM tuner is so bad that I can hardly get any FM stations and I live in an urban area with many FM stations.  My Sony did much better.  Every button is rounf and has the same tactile feel.  There is a row of 9 identical buttons.  Since I often use the radio at night, it's very hard to use in the dark.  Also, the buttons are very stiff and over half the time I get a soft click but the button-push does not register.  I have to press it again harder.  Each button seems to be covered in soft plastic.  I don't know for sure, but I suspect that these buttons.will not last long."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I had an 'inexpensive' clock radio that was just ok...but frustrating when trying to hone onto a station.  This Sangean radio has absolutely everything I needed, from ease of set-up to push button station accessibility.  And the volume dial is just an extra plus with its click-like control.!  It, too, was inexpensive but definitely NOT cheap in design.  Although it cost about the same as my previous clock radio it is SO much more going for it.  I would recommend it to anyone that wants an easy clock radio with a small footprint but a large sound."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The digital tuning and the digital volume are exactly what I wanted.  For a small radio, the sound is even better than I expected.  This was an excellent buy."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This Sangean is by far, the best clock radio I've ever owned. It is well worth the money. I use it in my bathroom and\nit sits on the vanity. I love to listen to radio while dressing and the reception on this radio is far superior to that of\na cheaper clock radio that I used prior to this one. The clock keeps perfect time and that too is good. The radio is\nattractive, neat and you can rely on it. I highly recommend this clock radio and I am happy that I traded in my old\none."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I needed a bedside radio for an alarm.  I've now gotten addicted to listening to the radio for the news just before I rise in the morning and before I go to sleep at night.  It is a perfect companion."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio is the best I have ever had!  Because of it's digital tuning, I am finally able to get radio stations at my desk in my office without difficulty finding a station or the aggravation of the signal fading away.  I highly recommend this to anyone for use anywhere in the home or office!!!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The quality of this radio has surprised me thus far, especially at this price point. Hopefully it remains reliable in the long term as well."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Good sound, nice looks.  Digital clock gains time, requires frequent adjusting.  Would be nice to set it a favorite wake up station and forget it even if you change it during the day. Would also be nice to automatically go to correct time as\nthe last Timex I had."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The clock radio is simple but efficient---and gets a good FM signal.  Sound is perfectly OK for a small unit.  The directions are in Chinese English, so they can sometimes be a slight bit confusing and amusing, but the clock radio is very much as advertised.  I wouldn't mind a more calibrated \"sleep\" function (it is in 15 minute intervals), but otherwise, I'm fully satisfied."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The only thing this clock is missing is a readout of the song and artist. Love the gradual alarm wake-ups and how you can choose how loud the alarm is. And the programmable buttons.  This is a great value for the money,  Love it!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I really want a clock radio with digital presets.  the Sony Dream Machine has a preferred set of buttons, but doesn't have the presets.  This radio is attractive, has all the features I need--sleep set, nap and presets so I'm pretty happy with it, but ...You do have to set the time and pay attention to the display as you are setting the sleep time.  Minor issues, but worth a star."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This clock radio gets good marks on many of its features EXCEPT -- and this is a biggie for me -- I have trouble reading the display at night without my glasses on. As a matter of fact, I can't read the time at all. I've tried changing the display brightness up & down without success. My old clock radio with red Digits on black background was easy to read. This display with thin black numbers on a bright gold-ish background is blurry.\n\nI'm going to see if I can find a magnifier to mount on the front."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Besides the usual problems, bright display, hard to set alarms, etc., the transformer started humming so loud you can't sleep anywhere near it.  Had this radio been engineered to simplify the controls and allow the display (not just the digital numbers) to be dimmed and had the transformer been manufactured with a little quality built in,  this could have been a great radio.  Sangean's online support says that the \"warranty period for a particular product is listed below\".  BUT, there is nothing there.  I clicked on \"register\" and it says the site is under construction.  It is 14 months old, so I guess I am screwed.  I will continue checking and update this review if they ever post any information."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It takes care of all things a clock radio should. I especially like the \"nap\" feature that lets you set the alarm for a 10 -120 minute nap. I don't like the phased wake up where the radio is very soft at the alarm and then gets louder. I would like it to be loud right away, but someone else might feel differently about that. That is the only problem. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was so tired of cheap clock radios. . .  The RCR-5 is solid, highly accurate in both clock and tuning, and gets excellent reception.  Very happy with it!  There are two challenges to know, however, before buying.  First, the viewing angle is limited.  Sitting on the night stand - about six inches above the level of my bed - I must lift up in bed to read the time.  It would be nice just to open my eyes and glance.  (I'm playing with a little wooden prop to angle it down - we'll see).  Second, setting the alarm is a multi-step process and, initially, not intuitive.  You may be tearing your hair until you figure it out.  However, once you take the time to read the manual (really pretty short and concise)and do it a couple of times, it is fine and only takes about 10 seconds.  The up side of the process is it's a no-question set-up for the morning (I always use the \"once\" setting because I get in trouble trying to use M-F or Sat\/Sun type settings).\n\nBottom line:  It works and, overall, is the best alarm I have ever owned.  Take a few minutes to read the literature and then play with it for a little bit to become familiar with how it works. You will be surprised how fast you internalize the process.  Although it could potentially be improved somewhat with better design, it may be one of those situations in which, to be most effective, you want a device that is made as simple as it can be, but no simpler.  (was it Einstein who said that?)\n\nCheers and thanks for a great product!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love my digital radio.  It is very difficult to find these and this one is durable, accurate, easy to set.  I would recommend it and am going to order another one."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I really like this radio.....Simple to use, good reception,nice sound.  I was hoping to replace my current bedside clock\/radio with this one, but the size was simply too small.  did not fit the footprint.  So i am using it in the kitchen, and it is perfect.  Brings in all the FM stations, no problems, and fits neatly in the corner.  I have another Sangean radio I bought 16 years ago that still works like a charm.........so I knew the brand was reliable. This is a super radio for a good price."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: After going through two Sony units where the LED display gradually faded so much you could not see it at all unless it was completely dark in the room, I decided to look for a backlit LCD unit and found this. Visibility on this unit is excellent. No problem either at night or in full sun. Backlight is continuously adjustable with a knob, and goes to full whenever you hit a button. Sound is the best of any clock radio I have owned, and I love the fact that you can program a \"wake-up\" station so you don't necessarily wake up to the last thing you were listening to. Tuner is also completely digital, so you are never listening to static because you \"bumped\" the analog tuning knob fumbling around on the night table in the dark. The only reason this does not have five stars from me is that I think the alarm programming is unnecessarily complex and difficult. Once you have the two alarms set where you want though, you can just turn them on and off with a single button press, so since we don't change our wake-up times often, I can live with it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I bought this to replace my old analog radio with a scratchy volume control. It is a big improvement. FM reception is very good and I live out in the boonies, far from most stations. AM reception is so-so but about the same as other radios I have.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that setting the alarm shouldn't need to be so complicated. There are a lot of steps, especially if you are going to wake to music. So make sure you put the manual in a safe place, you are going to need it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Got the radio for my wife's office she loves it and it works GREAT ! Like the Long antenna ! Very easy too setup !!!!!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I expected a larger radio with better sound, but it works for the AM radio that I listen to in the shower room.  Preset feature is good."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I like Sangean products and needed a new clock radio so this was an easy decision.  I love the radio, the sound is full and everything you could want from one speaker, but setting and using the alarm is a bit tricky for me.  The quality is there but the actual use of the alarm is difficult, especially in the dark."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Puts me to sleep and wakes me up, it's easy to use and has good sound for such a little box.  The part I like best is the ease in the ability to set 15,30,45 and 60 minute times for play before shutting down.  All the controls are solid; it feels well built."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I couldn't be happier with this radio, which I bought to replace a junky analog model by another manufacturer. It looks great...great reception...ample presets...easy to operate. Did I leave anything out? Oh, yes... I love the nap option!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I had been looking for a small clock radio that had both AM and FM with pre-set buttons for both bands.  This is incrediblly hard to find but, thankfully, I came upon the Sangean and it was just what I wanted and needed.  Also, the directions on how to set the alarm were not written so no one would be able to figure them out (which happened to me with the radios that I had purchased and then returned prior to coming across the Sangean).  I love that I can adjust the brightness of the dial.  Also, I can go back and forth from station to station so easily.  I am very happy and pleased with the quality of the sound also.  I would recommend the Sangean for anyone looking for a radio.  I am a very satisfied customer!!"}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: I have been without reception and NPR in my new apartment.  Finally I have found a radio that works.  There is also an antenna cord on the outside."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I have 3 criteria for a clock radio:\n  1. Good FM reception\n  2. Good AM reception\n  3. Easy of use\n\nThe radio tuner is this clock radio is acceptable, whereas most others that I tried are optimistically called Clock RADIO.  It's not great, just better than most others.  The buttons are well laid out.  I set the alarm and presets.  Went to bed and woke up being able to operate it in the dark.  It surprised me how well I remembered the button layout, basically out of the box.  The amber light is bright but doesn't fill the room with light (genius!).\n\nProblems:\n- Second alarm cannot have radio, instead you're left with \"Human\".\n- Alarm will default to \"Human\" if it is turned off with one band and the alarm is set for the other.  That alarm starts soft and ends too soon.  It repeats, but if your used to loud-mouthed, arrogant DJs to awaken you, you could oversleep.\n\nConclusion:\nIf grading on a scale, this radio would get 6 stars.  It outclasses most others, especially reception.  But, your gonna have to battle it out with your spouse over who gets the very \"Human\" alarm."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great radio at a reasonable price.  Fabulous AM and FM reception and good sound for a compact unit.  This is the second Sangean radio I have purchased and they are both great units."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Sangean has clearly put some thought into this radio. Small details make this a pleasure. The on\/off button is lit when it is off and dark when the radio is on, in the dark it makes sense. The volume control is a knob (although unfortunately with steps), much better than a button. The reception is very good. The alarms do not go through the headphone (or pillow speaker), very thoughtful. The backlighting is adjustable. It suits my needs almost perfectly."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: It is small sized, but has a lot of features.  It has two alarms with M-F, WE, or 7D functions.  It has volume ramp up when the alarm goes off.  Volume slowly increases, so you don't get jarred awake by the radio.  A single speaker with adequate sound.  Digital tuner reduces drift on AM stations.  Excellent reception on weak FM stations.  Five AM and five FM presets.  The adjustable backlit clock is highly visible, both day and night. I wish it had an audio output and stereo, but you can't beat the price."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: better than i expected, adjustable dimmer iworks great. reception is much better than sony it replaced. digital tuning is very easy to use along with the preset buttons."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This radio has woken me up at 3:51 a.m. when it's set for 7:00 a.m!  Not to mention it DIDN'T go off one morning at 7:00--only to find it somehow reset itself to go off at 7:00 p.m., which it did!  The owner's manual is pretty lamely written, and THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE INFO, nor anything said about what to do if you have problems with the product!  Both my husband and I had trouble figuring this clock out (and he has a Master's Degree in Technology!!!)"}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I have 3 other Sangean radios, PR-D7, and love those. This one was awful. It shouldn't be so hard to set up a radio. The battery back-up is a joke. I read the reviews and saw that others had the same problem with the battery part but I thought how hard could that be? I should have listened to them. I may have gotten the compartment open if I didn't care if the cover cracked but I was already frustrated with the rest of it. I sent it back which is something I seldom do."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This radio is appallingly bad.  I live 9 miles from Boston.  There are numerous mainline Boston stations I cannot receive on this radio that I can on $9 transistor.  What a piece of junk!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: A solid basic clock radio with several useful features, especially the variable brightness setting and the alarm that starts sotly and then gradually increases in volume. I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife and she loves it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I have had the Sangean Clock Radio for just over a month now and it is exactly what I was looking for.\nSetting and using the alarms is easy after one or two reads of the manual. It has two alarms which is nice. If you have a regular \"get up time\" you can set one alarm and leave it. Then you can use the second alarm for varying times. It also allows you to set the alarm for one time, for daily, week days only, or weekends.\nIt is nice that it has station presets...five for AM and five for FM.\nYou can adjust the light level on the display to suit your needs. Also, when you tap any button the light level increases which is nice in the dark. The light level then goes back to your preset after you are done with adjustments.\nThere is a timer that can be set for 60, 45, 30 or 15 minutes so you can listen to the radio when you go to sleep and it will turn itself off in your preset time.\nAn external single wire antenna makes for good reception which can be a challenge in my area. Reception and quality of sound is good.\nThis was a good value at a fair price. I am very happy with this purchase!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The screen showing the time was just too dim to read at night. After I have been asleep, my eyes don't focus well and I could not read the time.\nWill be returning it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I really like the way this radio sounds and looks. I have not yet been able to set the year, month, date and time even though I have read the directions carefully. Hope it's not because I got a used one that doesn't work. Probably not since I got two, since I liked the first one so much, and can't set either one. Have the station set easily and find the radio very good and easy to make louder and softer"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Bought the RCR-5 for my wife.  She wanted a radio in the bathroom to get traffic updates and weather before leaving in the morning.  We use it as a table radio, not an alarm clock, so I can't comment on it's alarm features.\n\nWe really like it as a radio.  The tone and volume from this small package are surprisingly good.  We have no trouble getting the AM stations that we want to hear, even some low power stations that are not close. The digital tuner does a good job of filtering out the nearby station that ruins AM reception for several stations on cheap analog tuner radios.  Wouldn't waste my money on another analog tuner model after owning this digital model.  The yellow face light is a little unusual, but not objectionable.  The radio comes with an attached small diameter wire antenna that is about 30 inches long.  You will need to find a place to run this wire for good reception."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: There are several things I love about this alarm clock.  It is the only alarm clock I have found that has every single feature I wanted (and some I didn't even know existed) at a very reasonable price.  For years I have covered up the face of my previous alarm clock (that finally broke) with an old baby bib because the bright numbers would wake me up every night and practically illuminate the whole room.  This clock allows you to dim the face from very bright to completely dark, without compromising my ability to see it clearly during daylight hours.  It has a nap button that I can set to any amount of time to accommodate my 20-minute power naps to a blissfully long two-hour snooze--no need to set the alarm and the forget to reset it before bedtime and accidentally oversleep.  I can wake to any one of six pre-set radio stations or to an alarm.  Both have something called the \"Humane Waking System\", which starts out quiet and then increases in volume to a maximum volume that I can set.  It also gives me the option of plugging my iPhone into it to wake to my own music.  It has two separate alarms for couples.  Finally, I can set alarms for one-time, weekdays and weekends!  I've never seen that before and I love it because I do like to sleep in an extra hour on the weekends and hate having to remember to switch my alarm back on Sunday nights.  Best alarm clock ever!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: the item was shipped promptly and packaged with care. It is a very compact radio and I have no complaints regarding its range.  I live about 35 miles from the tower and this not a problem."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This clock radio has all the features I was looking for and more. I'm not sure why it's so hard to find a clock radio with a headphone jack but there it is. This one has it. It's very user friendly, has nice sound quality and excellent reception. The buttons have almost silent operation which is great if you forget to set the alarm after your partner has gone to bed. Our last clock radio had a very annoying clunking sound similar to that board game, Trouble. And I love the back light. It can be dimmed to off and even when it's on the lighting is soft and unobtrusive. I gave it only 4 stars because it's kind of puny in size and it has only a 10 minute battery backup which kind of stinks in the case of a power outage."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This is not an HD radio, only digital tuning on an analog radio.  Nice radio for the kitchen.  I would not use it for your nightstand though.  There is no battery backup on the clock so if the power goes for more than 10 minutes the clock will not wake you up when the power returns."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: HAS TONS OF FEATURES AND RADIO HAS GREAT RECEPTION AND SOUNDS NICE FOR SUCH A SMALL RADIO.  DO NOT LIKE THE LONG STRING ANTENA BUT I WAS ABLE TO BALL IT UP WITH A TWIST TIE AND IT STILL WORKD JUST FINE."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: i switch from station to station. each one is 1push away. Only negative is there is no battery backup. next improvement for Sangean to consider."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I know most radio's today are FM only. It appears to be what the user audience wants to hear.\nFor me however, I like AM sports and talk stations. The Sangean is a super product. It includes digital stations and has five pre sets for each. The quality is very good. I believe this is a very well built radio. The speakers are good quality, and the visual display is very good. The size is also ideal. I'm very happy with my purchase."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The Sangean RCR-5 is just the type of digital clock radio I was looking for.(1) great sound quality, (2) readable digital figures, (3) each to use features, (4) has all the features that anyone would want in a digital clock radio, (5) especially like the auto turn off of the radio when desired, (6) great compact size-you would never think that this little radio has so many features."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I found this radio met all my expectations - easy to program, nice sound and very compact.  I had trouble with adjusting the alarm at first, but through an Amazon customer was able to figure it out.  I would absolutely recommend this radio."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: This is a good radio, however, very hard to figure out how to use the alarm clock. The audio in works excellent, however, I use my other alarm clock because I am never sure that I have entered the alarm correct as is so confusing to set."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Very happy with this radio.  Picks up a station in a college town that we were having trouble getting.  Like having presents so we don't lose stations."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I needed a bedside clock-radio to replace the 20-year-old machine that was big, bulky, and struggled to find the exact radio frequencies. This low-profile model meets my needs well. The time and alarms are relatively easy to set--a good thing since the instruction manual was obviously translated (poorly) into English and often gave me only a vague notion of the proper procedures. A few features I appreciate include the dual alarms which can be set for every day, weekdays only, or weekends only. You can also specify the radio station you want to play when the alarm goes off. This is a nice feature if you like to go to sleep to NPR but awaken to Classic Rock. The alarm begins with only a gentle nudge, then progresses in volume to a maximum you can pre-set. Also, unlike my old machine, there is no \"pop!\" or \"snap!\" just before the alarm radio station begins to play.\n\nThe clock does have a couple of minor but annoying quirks. Both the display illumination and radio volume levels are ordinal, not continuous. As such, the lowest increment (level 01) may still be too bright or too loud, respectively, for some persons. Also, I haven't figured out how to turn the alarm function back on without having to step through the entire setting sequence. Again, annoying, but forgiveable. Finally, there is a battery back-up for power outages; the power was recently out in our neighborhood for a few hours while the utility company conducted some maintenace, but the clock retained all my pre-set preferences. The instruction manual advises that the batteries be removed if the clock is going to be unpowered\/unplugged for an extended period. Damned if I can figure out where the batteries are and how to extract them. It seems one would have to disassemble the entire unit.\n\nThese minor bugs aside, I'm quite pleased with the unit."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Yeah its from china my dad already posted what he thought of this. Lets just say i sent his gift back and ordered a much nicer one for less."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I have two of these clock\/radios now.  Enjoy them.  Use them mainly to listen to the radio.  Have not used the alarm functions.\nRadio has good reception.  Got it mainly for the digital tuner.\n\nUpdate:  I now have purchased my 3rd radio.  It has good  reception - love the digital tuner feature."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I bought this for my desk at work as the analog radios keep fading in and out as I have an office in  a large hospital. this gets the radio stations I want with pinpoint accuracy, i also like the input for my IPad and the headphone jack for when other are around."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: My college-age son refused to buy an alarm clock because he wanted to use his phone.  I bought this for him anyway.  After the phone-alarm plan failed (as his parents predicted) he switched to this clock for naps and night time and praised us for knowing what is best."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: A little smaller than anticipated, but still good looking in appearance. The clock was quite visible and adjustable in brightness.  The button settings were relatively easy.  Unfortunately it did not receive all stations that I receive on my other clock radios, so I returned it.  A favorite station of mine literally did not come in, regardless of how I placed the antenna."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a well-designed radio with a great sound for music or talk. I have it on my kitchen counter and it is unobtrusive and blends in perfectly with our colors. It is easy to program stations and I like the push button ease of changing them. It even has aux plugs and ear phone jacks. I am really impressed with this radio - at 20 some dollars, it is a steal! If you are looking for a little clock radio, this is the one for you."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is the second Sangean I've purchased.  I bought one for myself four years ago, and it is still satisfying, if not exceeding, expectations.  The additional aerial wire makes my favorite FM stations clear and steady; and I live in an area with considerable reception problems.\n\nI bought the second one as a flat-warming present for my daughter, and she is just as satisfied.  Gets great reception in urban NYC.  I would definitely recommend this product without reservation."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Just what I wanted.  Has jack for earphones, digital readout, good sound, tells me if the radio is on or off and keeps good time."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I'm downgrading my review now that I've had the unit for 6 months. The on\/off button stopped working! After only 6 months! This renders the radio next to useless. I say \"next to\" because I am now leaving it on constantly so that I can still use it. When I don't want it on, I turn the volume all the way down.\n\nI have not abused the buttons in any way. The problem comes with the design. Since the \"sleep\" function requires the same button, that button gets used more often than it should. I would turn the unit on once every evening, then I would set the sleep function. They should never have designed the sleep function with the on\/off button. And there's no excuse for such a vital button not working after only 6 months.\n\nMy original review...\n\nI am so happy with this little radio. It's small, so it fits on my little bedside table. The backlight on the readout can be adjusted so it isn't so bright at night. The sound is awesome! I can turn the device to face any direction and the sound doesn't fuzz out like the analog radio I used to have. It was easy to program, even for a 56 year old lady like me. I'm thinking about getting another one or two to keep in different areas of the house."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: have used radio for several nights and it works fine. above average reception of am and fm, and i am 50 miles from st. louis. can get big out of town stations at night. easy to use. compact and sturdy. clear display with adjustable light level. 10 preset stations. volume control has detent dial, easy to adjust in dark. easy to set time, alarm, stations. alarm has tone feature that sounds over the radio to awake.\n\ndrawbacks:\n\n1. unit uses adapter rather than regular corded wall pug.\n\n2. i like to listen to talk radio at night and sound has more low range. better for music than spoken word.\n\n3. \"nap\" button in next to last station preset, so easy to activate by mistake in dark. but not easy to deactivate.\n\nthere are no other alarm units with digital station presets to my knowledge at this price point. would prefer a radio with more treble and less bass. otherwise, nice product so far."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great clock radio - brings in many stations.  Only problem is, (for me) I wish the clock display was easier to read - especially in the middle of the night with no glasses on!  Otherwise, very pleased and satisfied."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The radio was perfect but I live in Australia and did not realise that it won't work on our 240volt power.  Such a shame as it has all the features I was looking for."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: A nice clock radio. I bought a Sangean short wave radio in the early 1990s when I moved to Europe for a year. It was a brand I had not heard of but the sound was great and the radio worked very well.\nThis clock radio has a digital tuner (many do not) so the stations lock in well. Non of my analog tuners on clock radios work in my house because I live too close to a bunch of radio towers and have aluminum siding. This one works great being a digital tuner.\nThe two alarms are nice in that you can pick days they go off. I chose M-F for both but one 30 minutes later (back up).\nIt is a bit annoying in that you can't seem to just turn on and turn off an alarm easily. You have to click through the various settings in activating an alarm to activate one or turn it off. A total hassle. Maybe you can but, I don't see it anywhere or it is not intuitive.\nThis means that, if you want to sleep in on a holiday weekday you normally use an alarm to go to work, it is kind of a pain. You can't just turn down the volume wheel as, and this is ironically, a good thing, each alarm can be set to a *custom* volume level! Not only does it go from very very low ascending up in volume when it goes off but it will stop at a custom level for each alarm. Nice.\nThere is a headphone jack and mini input jack on the side. So you can play a smart phone and listen to any internet radio on the planet. I wonder if the headphone audio is stereo? Which leads me to make this comment: The speaker audio quality is so so. Muffled and lacking in treble. It is one speaker. They should have made it stereo for the price! But, wait, headphones? Are they mono? I need to check. Weird...\nThe picture shows a white radio but it is more yellowish white. The sides are a light gray, not black or dark grey as the image seems to show. My unit was made just a couple months before I got it so, I know it is not a yellowing of the plastic but, it is just not as pure a white as the image shows.\nOne other issue I found frustrating is that the display is not tilted up slightly. I am adding some rubber dot or square stick on feet (found at discount stores) to the front of it to raise it up a little so I can see it from in bed or standing by the bed. I have never had to do this with standard tilted display clock radios (I have owned since a kid - they last 5-10+ years typically) by Sony (analog radio with CD, still going), Oregon Scientific (digital, with phone, dead in 4 years), RCA (LED screen got wonky then useless in 7 years), etc.\nIf they did the fixes I mentioned, it would be worth it. If they added HD radio and did adjustments to make it easier to use and stereo, Sangean could charge another 20 and it would be a great radio. Right now, it is B+ (which is better than much out there) but not the best price.\nHowever, in my case, the dual alarm with digital tuner makes it the only clock radio (that looks nice, is small, etc.) that will work in my house! I'm keeping it - with small rubber feet under the front."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I've never purchased a higher end clock radio than the cheapest models from the discount store, but I splurged on this one.  I'm so glad I did!  The overall look of it is really unique on my nightstand and the amber display is so much nicer than the typical neon green glow.  It's got a nice dimmer on the display too, since it can get pretty bright.  The controls aren't the most intuitive but the manual is clear and helpful.  The radio works well and the sound is good.  I'm very pleased with this purchase!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: My wife and I like to use pillow speakers at night to listen to news, music, sports, etc.  It's surprisingly difficult to find a clock radio that has an earphone jack into which to plug the speakers!  So, we have \"twin Sangeans\" and they work reasonably well.  The button arrangement for presets can be tricky to negotiate by feel alone (all the buttons are the same size, and there are a lot of them for not only the presets, but off-on, alarms, and band).  But, there are five presets, which is helpful, and an easy digital tuning mechanism.  AM and FM reception are adequate, but not great.  Some FM stations suffer from adjacent channel interference, which I think should not happen with local stations.  In general, this is a good product at a reasonable price, and if you want that earphone jack, you'll find it here."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Update: The battery backup only lasts for several minutes. If you have a longer power outage it loses all settings. This makes it unreliable as an alarm clock.\n\nSo far it works great. A better design for the buttons would make it easy to change channels in the dark. Also it is NOT stereo. Only alarm clock I could find at a reasonable price that had digital tuner and ear bud output."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is an excellent, attractive clock-radio that I have had for over a month. The radio tuner locks quite well to the stations, the sound is clear, and I've been able to easily locate a number of FM and AM stations throughout my area. The controls for setting the date\/time and both alarms, while somewhat different from other clock-radios, are easily learned and reliable. Just follow the directions. I wish the volume level was adjustable for each alarm independent of the radio volume. The only other wish I have is that the dimmer control was more conveniently located on either the side or back of the radio; it is somewhat difficult to turn the control with it located on the bottom of the case while having such a short shaft to compensate for its location."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: what a great radio!!! We use it every morning and it is dependable, efficient, good looking, has some\ngreat features, has a perfect sound system, is lightweight, and the lighted screen is easy to read. This is\na reliable purchase and is just the right size!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I have had several lower cost clock radios, all of which proved unsatisfactory.  An important factor has been the difficulty of station tuning.  This model has the excellent digital tuning that I learned to appreciate on Sangean's pocket radios.  It is not as good as my Bose Wave, but so far seems an excellent  value."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: Just what I was looking for in a clock radio. Reasonably priced and simple to operate. It tells me the time and wakes me up. What else do you need?"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Living in Australia, we have 240 volt. The literature didn't mention anything about not working on 240 volt. My parcel arrived and I excitedly unpack my new Sangean RCR-5 Digital AM\/FM Clock Radio only to see the smoke and subsequent Fuse Box (house) click off.\nThat was the end of that ... It doesn't work in Australia ... Perhaps there should be more information on the product description about the power source and the fact that it doesn't work on 240 volt\nI had to throw it in the rubbish bin ...\nSadly Cam ..."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It's a good, basic alarm clock radio with a digital tuner.\n\nPros:\n- Does everything it is supposed to\n- Beep alarm starts softly and increases in volume\n- Digital tuner\n- Radio is good as long as antenna cord is dangled or raised from radio, station is strong or moderate strength, and the desired volume is moderate for same room use.\n\nCons:\n- Alarm volume could be louder towards the end of the loudness increasing cycle.\n- Interface is non-obvious enough that you'll have to read the short manual (10 small pages with big type and some pictures).  It is simple enough that you'll probably only need to read the manual once.\n- Radio reception is poor is the antenna cord isn't either dangled down or raised up.  Radio reception experiences bleed over from neighboring stations on weakest stations.  Radio max volume is fine for same room use, but don't expect to blare the radio.\n- Battery backup only lasts 10 minutes\n\nNow some lesser published info:\n- The brightness on the display is adjustable from extremely dim to pretty bright.  At the dimmest setting it puts out enough light to just see your thumb in a dark room at 6 inches from the display.  In other words, you'll definitely see it if looking at it in a dark room but it will be very dim.  At the brightest setting, the display is very bright if you look at it, but not so bright that it lights up the room that much.  Basically, it will cast a pale light in the vicinity of the clock (within ~ 3'), but I couldn't even see the effect on the far wall of the room (~ 12' away).  The power light in the upper right of the top is also lit red, but it is dim at all times.  The brightness of the display goes to max after hitting a button for about 3 seconds and then returns to the set brightness.  The brightness setting knob is analog and on the bottom of the unit.\n- The radio reception works ok for me.  It is very sensitive to the antenna position.  For the faintest stations it seems to only work well if I am touching the antenna.  The strong and moderate stations work fine with the antenna cord either hanging down from the unit or raised up from the unit.\n- The snooze is fixed at 5 minutes and not adjustable.  If the alarm goes off and you hit the snooze twice, it still goes off in 5 minutes.  (Just what I wanted)\n- The human wake system feature starts with a quiet beep and goes to more frequent and louder beeps.  It starts off inaudible and goes up to about the loudness of a typical alarm clock over the course of 1 minute.  If that fails to wake you, it will be silent for 1 minute, then repeat the 1 minute on, 1 minute off cycle for 1 hour before giving up.  The second cycle also starts quiet and builds over the minute.  The increasing volume only applies to the buzzer; the radio volume is controlled only by the analog wheel on the side of the unit.\n- There is a nap feature on the unit that lets you set an alarm for 10-120 minutes from now in 10 minute increments.\n- There is a sleep timer feature that will shut off the radio after 15, 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes.\n- When you set the alarm, you can chose between triggering every day, every weekday, every weekend day, or only once.  The unit keeps track of the year, date, and time.  It knows about the days of the week.  You cannot set the alarm for any other collection of days, those are the only options, so if you want an alarm for M-W-F then you'll need to look elsewhere.\n- The display usually displays AM\/PM HH:MM:ss, day of week, and which alarms are set.  There is an icon for snooze active.  The display shows band, frequency, and preset memory slot when radio is on for about 5 seconds then switches to time display as \"HH:MM on\".  You hit a button to see year and hit again to see MM-DD.\n- The sound quality on the radio is good but not powerful.  The audio starts clipping at around 1\/2 volume on the knob which is a moderate volume (good in same room only, won't be able to blast your ears at all).\n- There is an AUX in socket on the radio.  It is for playing only, not for alarm.\n- There is a headphone jack.  When headphones are plugged in, the speaker is muted.\n- The battery backup is only good for keeping the time and settings for 10 minutes.\n- The display can be switched between 12 hour display and 24 hour display.\n- There are 5 preset stations per band.  The are 2 bands: FM and AM.\n- The FM tuning step can be switched between 0.2MHz and 0.1MHz for the US version.\n- The AM tuning step is 9KHz for the US version from 520-1710KHz.\n- The power adapter is 120V\/60Hz only for US version which converts to 6V\/0.5A with a standard coax plug into the back of the unit."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: These are great, small (or rather not too big), easy to read clock\/station. Presets, earphone plugs, nice. Bought two of em, so we each have one. Finally a product from Sangean that even a layman can operate."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Forget all those naysayers!  For a compact am\/fm clock radio this one is excellent.  Great sensitivity to weak signals, great neighboring station selectivity, and great capture-ratio (ability to reject weaker signals on the same frequency).  Of  c o u r s e  it's  s m a l l !!  If you want high fidelity get a bigger receiver!  If the buttons and displays do not do what you want them to, follow the instructions on page 13 and do a \"factory reset\" (just read the excellent English instructions!).  And c'mon, guys, you don't get much fm reception without stringing an external antenna, plus accept the fact that the am antenna is internal and make the set face transverse to the direction of the signal if it is weak.  The display brightness is continuously variable and readable from any reasonable angle!  And, yes, it can be used as a dim night light.  All-in-all this little set is head and shoulders over those dinky clock radios, and with phase locked loop digital tuning to boot!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great radio.  Excellent reception.  It can even receive AM stations in office with fluorescent lighting when other radios that I  have tried have no reception."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: It wouldn't pick up AM stations at all.  Setting the alarm is difficult.  Once I figured it out, there was no way to turn off Alarm #1.  The instructions are poorly written with no trouble-shooting help and no phone number for questions.  So, unfortunately, it went back."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I regret tossing my cheap old clock radio. The old one didn't have great reception, but the Sangean RCR-5 is worse! I thought digital tuning would help, but it doesn't.  The other features may be fine, but who cares, if you have to keep moving the radio and fiddling with the antenna in order to hear programs.  I live in Boston, and even very local radio stations play with lots of background interference."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a great little radio.  Seems to be well made and is compact.  It brings in a really difficult station and the sound is clear.  I wanted it for the presets and it's so easy to set them.  I have one AM station I like to listen to also and what I love about the radio is that the \"Band\" button is right there on the top with all the other buttons, so I need only hit the band button and my AM station is there.  This radio has every feature one would look for in a radio--even an automatic adjustable-timer shutoff so you can go to sleep with the radio on and have it shut off automatically.  The only drawback I found was that it only has a battery backup for 10 minutes should the electric go out.  There isn't a 9v or other battery that can be installed for longer memory time.  I'm not using it as an alarm clock, so that wasn't an important feature for me.  I don't know when I've been happier with a purchase."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I use a small radio in the bathroom just so I can hear the news, traffic, or whatever as I shower and get dressed. I purchased this to replace my 10 year old Sony Dream Machine which still technically works, but has an analog tuner and a weak antenna which left me assuming strange positions to avoid hearing static. For reference, I am in a mid-rise condo in the heart of Chicago and have been using this daily for about a month. This is my first experience with the Sangean brand.\n\nI can't comment on the alarm features as I don't use those, but reception is far superior to the old Sony and it picks up stations the Sony could not. The speaker is not great, but it's better than the Sony and easily loud enough to be heard in the shower so it's certainly adequate for my needs. The presets work as intended and I can connect my iPod via an audio cord. The display is large and easy to read and you can adjust the display brightness via a knob on the bottom of the radio; it's also nice that the on\/off button glows a bit for instant recognition.\n\nI didn't give it 5 stars because it's nice, but a little expensive for a basic radio IMHO."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: 18 Oct. 2013:\nWhen the backlight is adjusted so as not to be objectionably bright late at night, it's too dim during the day. There's no happy medium. One thumb down on the display!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Neat little radio, very good sound and I'm thrilled about the five presets...not easy to find a radio that does that, for some reason.  I looked in Target and Walmart, to no avail.\nMy only suggestions are: 1) change the button size for the alarms...so you can feel in the dark for station changes, but you won't hit the alarm by mistake.  2) the numbers telling the time should be much a bolder black.  However, overall, a good deal for the money..."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: The sound is excellent. The reception is excellent.\n\nProblem: the wire connecting to the plug is very weak. Shortly after purchase, the radio began turning off. The problem is the wire. If I jiggle it, the radio will turn back on again, but only for seconds, before turning off again.\n\nThe radio is a bit difficult to set, and all settings are lost when the wire disconnects, so every time the radio shut down I had to reset it.\n\nTired of pampering this shoddily made product. Buying a new clock radio.\n\nIt's a shame because, as mentioned, the sound and reception are the best I've ever had in a clock radio. It's a shame that Sangean sabotaged their own product by installing such a shoddy wire."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The radio looks good, but it is smaller than the photo. This means a smaller speaker, with lower sound quality.\nSetting the alarm took a while to learn, but now it is useful as a radio alarm, & I expect to\nuse it for quite a while"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It's OK, but I might expect more features and options for a digital clock-type radio, like some more alarms (it has two), or some kind of electronic equalizer for the radio to make it sound a little better.  I've seen much better audio features in a $12 mp3 player.  The buttons are positioned symmetrically, which is OK, but I might have liked them positioned a little differently.  Still, it's OK for the price."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This product exceeded my expectations. I find very useful the option to set the alarm clock according to each day of the week. AM radio stations can be selected in steps of 10 kHz (and optionally 9 kHz) according to the characteristics of each country. The audio quality (mono) is more than acceptable for a clock radio. Very interesting the auxiliary output for speaker or headphones. In short, excellent quality \/ price and functionality."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: When I first received this product it worked relatively well. Now all I am getting is static and it will not pick up any station. This is the worst radio for the money that I have ever had to do business with. I would not recommend anyone purchasing this item. I also did not realize that it did not have a backup battery compartment when ever it's unplugged it loses all of the preset radio stations."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Very good rf performance, easy to use, Has convienient ear phone jack.\n\nno battery back-up but does retain settings for a limited power outage\nI wish the display could be dimmed"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is the second of these alarm clocks we have bought and both users love the gentle awake feature.  The clock also has a dial to set the brightness\/dimness so you can get that perfect.  There are dual alarms, waking to either the buzzer or radio (digital tune with dial for volume control).  Alarms can have daily or just weekday.\n\nUpdated July 2016 - we now own 3 of these clocks, still super happy with the feature set.  2 of the clocks unfortunately have lost the backup battery power, so when the power cuts the clocks reset.  There is no way to replace the battery...I opened one of the clocks up and there is a TINY coin-cell battery glued\/affixed to the circuit board.  Without a ton of motivation to pry it out, identify it, and then get it stuck back to the board you are without backup (which I am).  Have to change the review to 4 stars because of that as I think for a bedside alarm clock, a battery backup is very important."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: The radio is smaller than I expected.  Which is fine for my use.  But better to take measurements and see if this pillbox of a radio will \"fit in.\"  Also, the radio is not stereo.  Which is also fine for my use (and after seeing how small it is, stereo is out of the question!).  In this day and age one assumes any FM radio will be stereo.  Neither of these things was a downer for me, but can imagine this might disappoint\/surprise some.  In the end, $46 is high for this tiny, tinny (one 2 1\/2 inch speaker...) monaural clock radio.  And as others have mentioned, there is no REPLACEABLE battery to store settings--only a built-in 10 minute memory.  $30 would have been a fairer price in my book.  If it lasts 10 years I'll have no complaints.\n\nAddendum:  I will agree with another reviewer that to turn your alarm OFF you must depress a button until it BEEPS.  Loudly.  So say you need to get up at 3 AM and have set your alarm accordingly.  You wake up at 2:45 so have no need for the alarm.  To turn it off that loud BEEP  at 3AM will wake the dead.  (And your wife...)\n\nI see this radio is now $40 a week or two after I bought one...  Still, overpriced.  After 2 weeks of use I'd rather it had a large button to push to turn the alarm off.  AND...if your eyes are going bad, good luck deciphering the details like setting it to go off just on the weekends.  Or every day.  While it nicely SHOWS you which days you want it to alarm, only 20\/20 vision can see the days highlighted.  And with no glasses at night?  Hoo Haa.  This could all be forgiven at a $30 price point.  Maybe in another two weeks...\n\nDecember 10th:  The alarm no longer functions==cannot turn it on and off."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio has good sound - I usually listen to talk but OK for music.  Easy to operate, time easy to read, alarm good.  Size good - does not take up a lot of table space."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This digital radio alarm clock is just what I wanted. I found it very easy to follow the directions to set the clock and the alarm functions. Important for me was a clock that did not automatically follow daylight saving time since I live in Arizona. I also really appreciate being able to scroll forward as well as backward when setting the time. I love that you can have 2 different alarms programmed and they can be set either daily, week days, weekends or one time. You can awake to a preset radio station or beeping alarm. The radio is easily tuned with a digital tuner and there are 5 presets for storing favorite stations. The light is a warm amber back light that can be significantly dimmed for nighttime comfort. In the past with other alarm clocks I have always resorted to gluing a strip of vinyl sunshade window cling over the clock face to be able to tolerate the usually glaring light (even at its lowest setting) but not so here. Radio sound quality is above average for such a small clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this after getting sick and tired of buying a new cheapie clock radio every year or so. So far it has been very reliable. One of the default weekly alarm schedules makes it so you don't need to turn off the alarm every weekend. It's a nice feature, but obviously only useful if you work M-F.\n\nWhoever runs this company is obviously a music lover. The radio reception is quite good, and the sound quality surprised me. As a long time audiophile, this is important to me. I wasn't expecting much, and after all this is just a little clock radio with a tiny speaker, but it sounds as good or better than much more expensive 'high end' table radios I've heard. It does have a slightly laid back vintage type sound. I love this, but it might not be to everyone's taste.\n\nThe user interface is somewhat non-intuitive, and I actually needed to refer to the manual to set the alarm, etc. It's not horribly complex or anything, but worth noting. In my view things like this should be simple enough to operate without a manual. While this area could use improvement, overall it is so much better than other clock radios in this general price range, I consider it a minor inconvenience."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I have been through several terribly crappy alarm clocks and am so pleased to finally find the Sangean! The radio is super clear, the clock's time and alarm set controls are intuitive and easy. The display light dims to your liking and the sleep\/snooze features are great, too. If it would just make coffee, I'd love it more than my dog!"}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I regret not getting the atomic clock. Setting the dual alarms, resetting times, or wanting to shut off alarm ahead of time are much too complex.  Trying to decipher the direction manual is frustrating. Dimming of face light is a nice feature."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is by far the best sounding clock radio I have ever had. The PLL quartz tuning locks in FM stations and eliminates station \"drift.\" Over and above that, though, is the good quality speaker that has surprsing range for its size, And Sangean has employed a powerful enough amplifier that provides clean sound across that range. OK, it's not going to sound like your McIntosh tube amp, but I soon learned to appreciate waking up to broadcasts that didn't sound like your 3rd grade teacher dragging her claws across the blackboard. Took a second to figure out how to set the time and alarms, but after one go around it is  easily remembered. The only caveat I have with this product is that the time display is not very easy to see unless you are fairly close and looking nearly directly at it. Something about the orange backlighting washes out the LCD 7 segment displays no matter how you want to tweak the brightness setting. Which I alkso think would have been better served as a digital setting using the top buttons rather than a potentiometer underneath the radio. Still, trifles at their worst. Want to be awoken to sweet sounding music in the morning? This radio fits the bill well."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a very tidy and attractive device. The sound is excellent. One sleepless night I plugged in my i-phone headset and listened to opera on NPR. Very smart little radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Thanks to the other reviewers, I was aware of the particular quirks of this radio before I bought it. (The reviewer who noted how to dim the display with the button on the bottom of the radio was spot-on.) I was looking for a radio with good sound quality and reception, and an any-color-but-blue display. Bingo. This was it.\n\nWe live in an area with lots of interference. Clock radios were always a challenge for us, but the antenna cord is long enough for it to be put in the right place for a strong signal. I also don't like a lot of ambient light in the room, and dimmed all the way down, this clock radio is just perfect for me.\n\nA feature that I also like is the nap timer-- brilliant thinking, Sangean! No need to mess with your daily\/weekly settings if you just want to take a short nap.\n\nI don't need to have a fancy clock radio, and I don't have a lot of bed-side space. If you are looking for a solid clock radio and don't need the docking capability of other radios, this is for you (though you can still connect your MP3 if via a cable if you want to). Call me old school, but I just want to listen to music before I go to sleep and wake up to my favorite morning newscast. Simple is sweet!\n\nI went through three clock radios this year trying to find the right one. Now I am considering buying another one of these to have on hand when\/if the one I just bought gives up the ghost. Good price, great value."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The radio is nicely made and operates well except that the tuner lacks sufficient sensitivity to pull in our favorite classical music station unless the antenna wire is positioned just so, and just so is a decor problem.  WCRB has a weak signal but other table radios we have had in the past have been able to lock onto it, including a Sangean non-digital table radio on an upper floor."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This radio is well built.  The alarm works well.  The reception is adequate for this level of radio.  The nap alarm is good.  It is easily set."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I wanted a radio that had alarm clock features instead of an alarm clock with some radio features. This is a nice radio, pulls in stations and has good quality sound. It could use a longer time for power off backup. Shipping was fast."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I thought Sangean was a good brand, and the radio sure looks nice. But the light, which you can't dim, kept my wife awake. The alarm took 10 steps to set--so how could I trust it? And the radio reception (we live right near a big city) was crummy. I'm returning this piece of junk."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This item is fine.  I especially like the dual alarms and the nap feature (a count-down alarm).  Sound quality is fine.  It is nice to be able to plug in my M3P player and headphones.  I do agree with some of the other reviewers that programming the alarm is a little confusing and the multitude of buttons (all in a row) makes it a little difficult to press the right one when, for instance, you are just waking up and reaching over to turn off the alarm."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a real good radio alarm.  The receiver is strong for both AM & FM stations and the speaker sounds sharp and clear.  Controls are easy to use and function as stated.  I would recommend this product."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio lives up to its reputation in every way. It was recommended to me by a friend at Curves who uses it in her kitchen. My Sangean RCR-5 digital clock radio is located upstairs in the bathroom\/dressing room and it performs beautifully there. I chose to move it downstairs where I could listen to it for a longer time and was pleased to find that I was able to do this without losing the clock and channel settings."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was surprised with this radio. Very easy to set up and use. I will admit that is has some features that I will probably never use, but I am sure that other people will need the features. The radio has good sound for a mono system and will pull in even weak stations. A very good buy and the price can't be beat."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: I can't use the radio, the sound is so bad.  It took me a half hour to set the alarm\nand I  don't change it because I am unwilling to go through the torture a second time.\nI do like the gentle bird sound for the alarm, gradually increasing in volume and the\nfact that the alarm goes off every morning without my having to reset it.\nFor those two factors, I did not send it back, but the radio and clock could be\ngreatly improved."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I ordered this radio because of all the good reviews I read. They were right. It's construction is very good quality, the sound is good and I like the pre-setting of stations by pressing a button. The one issue I have is the display lighting.\nIt should be even less when turned all the way down, and the fact that the light turns on full when you press any button is really annoying at night. It would be nice if they had an on\/off switch under the radio (where the dimmer knob is located) that would turn this function on and off.\nI'd still recommend this product, however, because too often I buy something on line and find out that its built like a piece of you-know-what. This is an exception."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Surprisingly good sound for such a small unit and I would highly recommend it.  Some of the instructions in the manual would be easier to understand if the English was better (a pet peeve of mine).  And I would love a few more radio preset buttons but all-in-all it's a great little radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I usually purchase the cheap radios at the local box store. Several years ago, I treated myself to a Sangean portable so I could listen to mp3's ( using an SD card ). I was so impressed, when my last clock rang its last, I got the RCR-5. The AM reception, which had been barely tolerable on the old clock, was fantastic. The unit is easy to set up, works great, sounds great. It has a solid feel and is heavy enough so it doesn't slide around when I touch it. One note: the instructions are not really clear about dimming the illuminated numbers - turn the unit over and there is a small knob to adjust the light."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: For years we have struggled with an analog clock radio that had terrible reception. Finally, when it couldn't receive a signal with moving it around, we decided to upgrade.  I love the way we can dim the backlighting on the LCD screen.  I also love the digital tuner and the ability to zero in on a signal.  The antenna allows up to pull a strong signal from our favorite all news radio station, so we can get up or listen to traffic and weather before we go out any time of day.  Highly recommended."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio fits the bill. I needed something basic (AM\/FM) for my bedside. It has a small footprint, and most importantly it has a jack for a headphone speaker.\n\nThe dimmer feature for the display is nice - this is done manually (and does not adjust automatically to the lighting environment like on a Bose). However, if you put the radio on, the display momentarily brightens. This could bother a roommate if you fiddle with the radio during the night.\n\nThough I haven't used it, this also has a separate button for a \"nap\" alarm feature. So if you feel like stretching out for a while (with or without the radio on), you simple press the nap button for a set amount of minutes which will beep when time is up. I suppose this could also be useful as a \"reminder\" feature -- ex: if you are watching TV or reading in your room, and you want to remember to throw laundry from washer to dryer.\n\nThe time display includes seconds - which was different than other bedside clocks I've owned.\n\nI would add one more star if my reception were better -- but I don't think this can be attributed to the radio. It's a function of where I live."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I purchased this cuz I wanted a digital radio and a clock together....It is so hard to get my christian radio station in when I have to use a dial radio...this way i just scan for my station # and perfect reception !!!  Worth every penny.\n\nI have had this over 8 months now."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The Sangean RCR-5 was purchased primarily as a wake-up device to replace a much simplier, analog Sony clockradio that failed after 30 years of reliable service. There is no question the RCR-5 has all of the capabilites we want in a digital clock radio...AM\/FM capabilities, two alarms, and so forth. The availability of a short external antenna is a real plus, giving us the opportunity to 'pull in' a weak college FM station that plays jazz and classical music throughout the day and night (no commercials, of course).\n\nBut...setting up the RCR-5 can be a bit tricky, requiring a careful read of the manual and absolute adherence to the step-by-step instructions. And it's with respect to the latter that the wheels occasionally come off the wagon. I haven't seen a manual such as the RCR-5's since reading the ones provide with home entertainment equipment from the Far East in the 1970s. One would think that today, Sangean would have spent the money to have an editor clean up the English version (which is what I used) so that it didn't contain nonsense such as the examples below:\n\n\"Alarm setting can be done while the power is during ON or OFF position.\"\n\n\"c. The setting will automatically complete the setting after 30 seconds without any button pressed. But when the ALARM RADIO is under setting, it will not complete automatically until the TIME SET of POWER button is pressed.\"\n\nSuffice it to say you may have to read portions of the manual several times before you understand exactly what is being said and what you are required to do.\n\nTwo negatives:\n\n1. The radio has an internal battery back-up unit that only stores the clock and radio presets for 10 minutes. How much better would it have been to include provisions for two AA batteries! When the power goes out in our neighborhood, it's usually out for hours at a time.\n2. The ON-OFF button on the top, right side of the radio is no larger nor higher than the other buttons in the same row (though it is lighted internally). It would have been better to make it slightly taller so that it's easier to locate by touch in the dark for shutoff upon waking.\n\nAll in all, though, having set up and used the radio for more than a week, we are very pleased with its performance."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: After a lot of reviews on clock radio's I went with this one because of the digital radio tuner and dual alarm with day set. Works great and would recommend it for other's. Only thing I don't like is that you can't pick the days of the week separately, You can only pick Monday-Friday, Saturday an Sunday, or everyday. I work Sunday-Thursday so I have to set it for everyday and turn it of on Friday and Saturday. Radio work great and it has a wire antenna for reception."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a handy little clock radio.  Thanks to the antenna wire it picks up stations better than my old radio and I really like the preset station pushbuttons."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Wonderful overall size to sit on a nightstand or dresser edge next to your bed.\n\nQuality overall is better than I expected.  Fit and Finish is perfect.  Buttons depress with a fairly solid click-feel.  Little rubber feet underneath keep it nicely planted on any hard surface (wood, glass, stone, countertop,...).  Display is crystal clear.  Display brightness is easily adjusted with a dial peg underneath the unit (I don't know how the lowest setting could be too bright for anyone.....the highest brightness setting still doesn't pass for a night lite in my opinion).  The Display can be read perfectly clearly viewing at wide angles from left and right, or when looking down at it from above.  The Display fades from sight pretty quickly when viewing up from a head position below the unit.\n\nThe manual is more than adequate.  As others have noted, some words are poorly chosen.  That said, it is not that bad to get through.  When I saw the owners manual for the 1st time before opening it I kind of cringed a little since it was fairly thick, and I thought I was going to have a lot of reading for what seemed like should be a fairly simple alarm clock\/radio.  But after opening it I realized it was actually minimal reading and straight forward.  13 of the 70 pages make up the English language portion.  Plus it's all in Giant easy to read print and well spaced.  Of those 13 pages, most will only care about 9 pages, unless you really need to be told not to take a bath with it or other stuff relating to other countries.\n\nThe alarm is not super loud.  That said, for any light-normal sleeper it will be more than adequate.  Even for most heavier sleepers I think it's probably adequate since if it jives with you you can set one alarm for the buzzer and the other to go off on radio set to MAX volume.  If you only prefer to use the buzzer for an alarm setting, then even for regular heavier sleepers you'll probably want to pass on this unit.  For pretty much all SUPER heavy sleepers out there, you will more than likely need a louder alarm.  General FYI;  The buzzer setting for the alarm(s) does not really \"buzz\" at all, but rather \"beeps\".  Many will appreciate the HWS (Human Wake System) for the buzzer alarm setting (does not work for the radio alarm setting).  With HWS, the alarm buzzer starts out almost inaudible and progressively gets louder during the course of a minute, as which point it begins again and continues for another minute, and repeats the process for an hour (I didn't test it for an hour, so I am relying on their word, though if you are still sleeping after an hour from the time you set the alarm to go off I'm guessing you're day is pretty much ruined anyway).\n\nWhen using the radio as your alarm setting, whatever volume you have the volume control for the radio set at is the volume it's going to wake you up with.  Here's the potential problem with that for some;  If you choose to use the radio as an alarm, BUT you want to use the radio Sleep Timer to fall asleep, whatever volume you set the radio Sleep Timer at is the volume your radio alarm will sound off at.  In other words, if you set the radio sleep timer volume really low, that's the same volume the radio alarm will sound off at which may not be loud enough for you to reliably wake up when you need to.  Hope that made sense.  The snooze function (nonadjustable 5 minute interval for buzzer alarm) does NOT work for an alarm set to radio.  For an alarm set to sound with the radio station you have it set to, you must use the radio power button to turn it off.  Ultimately what's going on is the alarm set to go off using the radio simply automatically turns on your radio without you pushing the radio power button to turn it on yourself.  Therefore to turn off the alarm that sounded via the radio, you're simply pushing the radio power button to turn it off, just as you would turn it off when generally listening to the radio.\n\nThe manual is WRONG on how to shut off either or both of the alarms set on buzzer.  The manual says to press the appropriate alarm button (Alarm 1 or Alarm 2 buttons) and hold it down for 2 seconds at which time you'll hear a beep and the alarm should be deactivated.  At least on my unit this is NOT true.  On my unit when an alarm buzzer goes off, neither the alarm 1 or 2 buttons will beep or deactivate the alarm.  The only button on my unit that will turn off any alarm on any setting (buzzer or radio) is the general radio Power On\/Off button.  I have no issue with this in general.\n\nRadio Usage;  sound is good virtually all the way up to MAX volume.  I'm not saying it sounds like a Bose system but that's not what it is, and only a fraction of the cost.  Overall it has more than adequate sound quality.  I'll give radio reception a 4 out of 5, not because I really find issue with it as it pulled in all 3 stations (2 local, 1 not local) perfectly that I cared about, but that I've never owned a radio that I didn't want to have better reception for outlying areas (can't get the out of town AM station I was hoping for, but even my car will only pick it up sometimes).  MAX volume is enough for general radio listening throughout an attached kitchen\/living room area.  In a garage where you may also be doing some banging around and whatnot, you may want something with higher volume than this unit is capable.  For the vast majority that aren't interested in cranking up the music extra loud, volume levels will be more than acceptable in the home or out on the patio.\n\nLittle Things:  Love that it always shows the day of the week.  Wish it also always showed the date, but rather you have to push the display button twice, once for the year and a second time for the month\/day of the month.  General FYI, the radio power button is nicely backlit when the radio is OFF, no other button is, but when the radio is ON (generally or as an alarm) it is not backlit.  It does have a plug in space for headphones.  It does have an AUX IN plug-in space like for to plug in a portable CD player where you can then use the units speaker for sound.  It does not have any AUX OUT plug-in space which I wish it did to be able to plug in better right left speakers for those who want a little more sound, and that you could then aim directionally.  The unit is NOT stark white like the pictures imply (in my opinion) but is rather an off-white.  The gray on the rest of the unit is exactly as the pictures imply.  It came nicely packaged.  It has a built in battery backup that's good for 10 minutes of power outage.  I wish it had either a longer lasting (3 hour) built in battery or a space to put accessory batteries that would last much longer regardless (I live in Arizona where during the monsoon season it's not unusual for the power to be out for an hour or two a couple times a year or so).\n\nBottom line:  I feel this clock\/double-alarm\/radio is worth more than the money asked for.  I would highly recommend it for anyone to themselves or given as a gift, unless whoever is going to use it mainly as a wake-up alarm is a very heavy sleeper (where there's a good chance the alarm isn't loud enough) or simply needs a louder radio (for areas with lots of ambient sound or very large areas overall like a small warehouse environment...).  For anyone still sitting on the fence toward making the decision to buy or not, outside of possible given limitations I've noted, I would add a couple things;  1)  I could not find another product that remotely compared for the price (other than similar but different units from the same manufacturer), and 2)  It is not as difficult to initially set up as some make it out to be.\n\nOne last comment on turning off the alarms.  As noted earlier;  At least on my unit you do have to use the radio Power On\/Off button (a single quick press) to turn off either alarm, whether they are set to go off on Buzzer or Radio.  What I don't like when an alarm uses the radio to wake you up is that when the radio is on, the radio main Power On\/Off button backlight goes out.  So if it's still dark in the room at the time the radio alarm comes on you may have to search for the button till you get used to it's location to shut the alarm off.  It would be nice if it always stayed lit up whether the radio was on or off so it could still be clearly seen in the dark.  Also, some reviewers complained that they accidently pressed the main Radio On\/Off power button twice to turn off an alarm which on the 1st press turns off their alarm, and on the second press turns on the radio just as if you wanted to listen to it, which they didn't.  I don't see what the big deal is, as one more press of the same button turns the radio right back off again.  And, you have to press the button with firm pressure to completely depress it at all which makes it surprising to me that anyone is having issues double pressing it in the first place.\n\nSincerely hope this review helps you make an informed buying decision!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The radio is attractive, right size for a small night stand, and has easy to use controls.\n\nUnfortunately, the reception was terrible.\n\nI live 45 minutes from Manhattan. There are dozens of powerful AM stations in the area. I expanded the built in antenna, put it out my 2nd floor bedroom window, and yet was unable to receive with any AM station - amazing. I have several small portable radios that pulled in AM stations in the same location as the clock radio.\n\nI sent the radio back and plan to avoid Sangean radios in the future."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I'm not often given to superlatives, but for this product I'll make an exception. After a horrible experience with another brand (3 initials) and reading the generally favorable reviews of this clock radio, I decided to take a chance. I'd never heard of this brand until recently, but desperately needed to quickly replace another brand that died after six months.\n\nI was impressed from the moment I took this product out of the box. It felt solid, substantial; not like it was going to fall apart if breathed on too heavily. The overall construction appears well finished with no gaps or excessive flexing. The buttons also feel very solid, not flimsy at all. In the case of this radio, first impressions were just a hint of what was to come when I plugged it in.\n\nA quick perusal of the clear and well written instructions and I had the date and time set within a minute or two. Next came the real test - the radio. We live in a difficult reception area, in the foothills of a small mountain range upon which perch our city's primary broadcast towers. You might think that being so close to these towers, reception would be a piece of cake. It ain't necessarily so. Antenna patterns tend to radiate out more than down, so actually being so close our radio reception tends to be pretty spotty with only a few very static filled stations coming in at all, or at least it had been with every other clock radio my wife or I have owned while living here. Until now.\n\nHere is where this amazing little box shines, and shines blindingly. When I turned the radio on for the first time, quite honestly I wasn't expecting much. Per the instructions I held the tuning + bar in to initiate a scan. Within a few moments, I was treated to a sound I had not heard from a bedroom clock radio for many years - music playing clearly, without static, crosstalk or any other interference. Breathlessly I pressed scan again...and was again treated to a clear, static free station. I pressed one of the preset buttons to save the station, and continued my search, subsequently finding and saving four additional stations, all ones that I like, all clear, all perfect reception. Wow!\n\nWhatever Sangean has done to make this radio receiver work, they have done very, very well. The sound, while certainly not audiophile, is actually surprisingly good from the single 3\" top firing speaker.\n\nAgain, following the instructions, I set times for the two alarms. Here you can choose from all days, week days, weekend, or single occurrence. When choosing to wake to radio, you may also choose one of your preset stations for each alarm.\n\nSo far, I'm very impressed with the build quality, design, and radio reception of this clock radio. I look forward to many years of good service, and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an extraordinary value in a good looking, good sounding clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I wanted a clock radio that I could pre-set radio stations.  I wanted one that had a headphone jack so as not to keep my husband awake while I listen to Coast to Coast after midnight.  I wanted one with a sleep (or nap) timer.  I wanted it to be small by my bedside.  I wanted a digital readout with a pleasing backlight.  This radio has everything I need.  Just one little issue:  I would have liked a CD feature, but given a choice I prefer the headphone jack over the CD feature."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This was a great alarm clock radio. To set the alarm for Monday through Friday was easy and the display has adjustable brightness. The best part was how great the reception was."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This clock radio fits the bill in terms of size and functionality. I also like that the light can be dimmed down - which is a reason I chose it.  The radio signal is good and I live in a canyon so this is important.  The two drawbacks I see are that when you want to put it on the timer to turn off in 60 minutes, it emits a loud beep. This isn't so good when you don't want to wake anyone else up. Also, it has a \"nap\" function button which is right next to the power button. If you accidentally hit the nap button instead of the power button, it then sounds an alarm in 60 minutes to wake you up from your nap. I have done this a couple of times and I thought I had turned if off, and in fact it woke me up an hour later. So the button placement is not optimal when you are trying to turn it off\/on by touch.\n\nI would recommend it because the good features outweigh the bad - I would just eliminate the beep on the timer, and move the nap button somewhere else if I were making a perfect radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I had to return the radio...it went to all static on an important AM radio station that a very cheap radio would hold.\nThe FM was good.  The small, look-alike control buttons were inconvenient. It should have a better design for controls.\nI am sure that in some states\/locations this would be a good radio. I am from central NJ...A month later, I again bought the RCR-5..the static sgain occured on the same AM station to a lesser extent. It was tolerable, so I kept it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Easy to transition from AM to FM.  I love the preset station options and the digital tuning.  The earphone\njack is another great feature.  We are very pleased with this product."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Okay, it's just a clock.  But it replaced my older-than-dirt Sony Dream Machine, a very old alarm clock that I loved-dual alarms, programmable by day, sleep, snooze, digital tuning with presets.  I waited this long because I couldn't find anything with the same features as the Sony, not even the current Dream Machines, which are all analog tuning.  Why'd they do that?  Lost a happy customer--dumb.\n\nIn any case, in every way except one the RCR-5 is equal or better.  The reception is better--more stations and I didn't even uncoil the FM antenna.  Sound is as good or better (see first sentence).  The Sony's display was undimmable; this one is infinitely dimmable.  Setup is  more intuitive than the Sony, but I'll keep the manual nearby anyway.  I like that is has a sleep timer, but I liked the sleep timer on the Sony better.  It had a dedicated button with a tactile bump I could find in the dark from a variety of odd sleeping positions and press it the requisite number of times to drift off to sleep and have the radio shut off automatically after 15 minutes, my usual.  The RCR-5 requires you to press and hold the radio on\/off button as the 60, then 45,, then 30, etc. alternatives go by, releasing it when you get the one you want.  Which means I'll have to look at the bright display to manage it, which will force me to move and look and basically wake up more than I like to to do this.  Maybe this won't matter to most folks, but me no likey.  We shall see.\n\nStill though, an awesome alarm clock\/radio."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I live in close proximity to NYC and neither the AM nor FM band of the radio could find a single station. Not even \"hiss\" coming from the speaker. Tuner is totally defective. I own a Sangean Internet radio and bought this assuming it would be of the same quality - it fails."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excuse my excitement but seriously I have never been more satisfied with an online purchase.  It gets excellent reception, the speaker is small but has good sound, and the HWS is 1,000 times better than that annoying ear-splitting BUZZZBUZZZBUZZZBUZZZ every morning.  PLUS!  It has a DIGITAL tuner!  This clock radio is almost half the price of others with the same features.  BUY IT!  You won't regret it!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Good sound; does just what I want it to do - wakes me up at the proper time!  Easy to read clock - numbers are large but not too large.  Perfect fit for bedside table.  Very happy with it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Let's be clear - I don't use the alarm functions on this clock radio.  I just wanted a digitally-tuned clocked radio for my bathroom so that I could listen while getting ready for work in the morning, after showering, etc.  Digital tuning was important because it's so much easier to switch stations.  It needed a decent clock as well so I know what time it is on work mornings.  So far, I love this thing.  Decent workmanship (it seems so far), buttons work really well and the radio reception is exceptional - FM and AM.  The sound has a bit too much bass behind it for my tastes, but I've gotten used to it.  Thinking about the sound, the quality is WAY better than any other clock radio I've owned, even a high-end Sony one from several (ok, many) years back.  I would buy this again without hesitation and am extremely happy with my purchase."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am of a seemingly rare breed that is only interested in an \"FM Alarm Clock Radio\" for one thing - that it will wake me up to my favorite radio channel without static.  I don't care about different buzzers, that it projects or not, that it can recharge my iWhatevers... I don't care about the sound quality of said radio, how stylish it looks, if it can set its own time, if it has \"Humane Wake,\" etc.\n\nI just need it to keep time and wake me up to my station without static.  And my 28 year-old analog radio I probably bought at Drug Fair (antecedent to Rite Aid) stopped doing that.  I am happy to say, this clock does what I need... with an annoying quirk that isn't a deal breaker for me, but could be for you.\n\nFor the people that complain about it being too complicated or too difficult to program.... you either didn't read the directions or you are an idiot.  I found it perfectly user friendly so long as I read the directions.  A machine doesn't have to be \"intuitive\" if it comes with accurate directions.  It comes with adequate directions.  Read them.\n\nThe FM clarity was perfect - but I did have to fully deploy the little white antenna cord (I was hoping this was amazing enough that I could keep the cord discreetly coiled up next to the machine.  I don't care though... clarity was my goal here.  No static.\n\nI'm not going to write about all the other bells and whistles because I don't care about them and will likely never use them.  I will say it IS cool that I can set two different alarms, because it just so happens that I wake up at two different times during the week, depending on the day... that is nice.\n\nHere's the thing that might drive you crazy and be a deal breaker for you (it's not for me) - if you are nearsighted, and don't wear contacts or glasses while sleeping (who wears glasses while sleeping), you will not be able to see the time in the middle of the night unless you have the screen dimmer cranked up to flashlight-level bright and then it's about 50\/50 you will see it.\n\nThe good people at Sangean were smoking crack when they designed the opticals of this clock radio.  Viewing the digital readout is a function of how much contrast there is between the numbers and the background - not brightness of the entire viewing area.  You can adjust brightness but not contrast.  If you amp up the brightness to improve the contrast, it's too bright.  If you dim it, you lose contrast.\n\nSo in order to see the time at night if you are nearsighted, the clock must be no more than 2-3 feet from your face on the pillow no matter how bright you have it.  Period.  You will not see the time with it any further away, so don't even think about it.  If you think you will read the time from across the room, forget about it.  Now, with it that close to your face, unless you like sleeping like you're under interrogation in a Viet-Kong prison camp, you're gonna want to turn the brightness down to its lowest... then you can barely see the screen BUT ALSO THE TIME ALONG WITH IT.  You are forced to choose between the lesser of two evils.  This ultimately works out for me, because my clock sits about 2 feet from my face and as long as I squint at it in just the right way, I can still make out the time on it's lowest dim with my nearsightedness (I am -5.25 in both eyes).\n\nSo it works for me... I'll update if something goes wrong.  If you have perfect eyesight, you have no reason not to buy this clock, so just buy it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: We needed a replacement radio\/clock and this one has been great!  Works wonderfully and easy to use.  You can preset stations and it even counts down the minute, so you can time yourself when you brush your teeth."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I bought this because I would mostly be listening to public radio on this clock radio, and I wanted one with good reception. That part is wonderful. Two things I didn't realize, which might have changed my mind about purchasing are:\n1. There's no backup battery. There's a factory installed backup\/memory, but it only lasts for 10 or 15 minutes. We get a lot of thunderstorms in my area, and a lot of power outages at night, which means if we lose power at 1am my alarm won't be going off in the morning.\n2. When you set the alarm it makes a loud beeping noise. This isn't an issue if you are able to use the automatic settings (e.g., the same time Monday through Friday). But if you need to make a change, and you don't realize it until after your partner or spouse is asleep, you will likely wake him or her up."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: One of the best clock radio I have every purchased for the price.  I like the external headphone jack feature a lot, as I like to fall asleep with the radio on, and my wife does not like too much noise."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Does everything it's supposed to do. Was easy to set up. Small footprint on small table. Only 20 seconds slow in 30 days. I like the quiet to loud wake up beep. Can hear and understand news and weather OK. Still messing with screen brightness. If it lasts 20 plus years like old Panasonic, I'm happy."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This was a very good purchase.  Much better than anything you will find on the store shelf as far as the quality of the radio.  It tunes stations very well, and the AM band is very good as well.  For the more than casual radio listener this is a very good purchase."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I wish I had kept the packaging to return. The light it casts is a sickly yellow and the time can only be seen from a certain angle, so good luck seeing what time it is if you're on the side of the bed that has the wrong angle. My husband didn't believe me, so the next day, he looked at different angles and found that it was only viewable straight-on. Also, the beep sound to tell you that the alarm is set or not set is a pain because at times you want to unset it in the night and night wake spouse up. And it's overly complicated. We moved it to the kitchen and just use as a radio. Oh, and the radio sound is muffled and weak. Ugh."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Who would put seconds (in fairly large numbers no less) on an alarm clock.\n\nI can see myself watching the seconds tick by on nights with insomnia.\n\nSo far I like this clock though it is far from my ideal\n\nIt does have dual alarms and allows you to choose the days you want each alarm active.  However, how to set the alarm is not intuitive and I had to read (gasp) the directions to figure it out.\n\nI don't like beeping alarms and typically wake to radio.  The beeping alarm on this fits the description of humane alarm.  Loud enough to wake but not so irritating I want to throw the alarm clock against the wall."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Tuning works well, sound quality is good for a little box like this--controls are not too confusing, better than some.  The reason to downgrade it is that the display is almost impossible to read--it consists (as shown) of dark characters on a orange\/yellow background.  The other way around might be give better results, but in a dark room from 10-12 feet it is extremely difficult to read.  I see little excuse for marketing the device without putting it out to some sort of focus (a little joke there) groups for feedback."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I've owned one of these radios for some time, using it in my bedroom as an alarm, as well as a radio.  I have been so pleased with it, I bought another one for my family room, just to be used as a radio.  The size is very compact and the sound quality very good.  The setup process could be easier....time allowed to complete individual settings is too short, in my opinion.  Otherwise, I am very happy with both radios."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio had all the features I was looking for, at least as far as it could be discribed.  How do you discribe sound?  the sound is WEAK;  normal loudness, if near, is fine on its loudesrt setting, but cannot be heard in the shower. nice clean appearance and the night light it shows is just fine too."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is just a great clock radio.quality built.sounds great.easy to program. controls are easy to access. I love this machine. Light is not a problem being too bright. Love the way the light dims after using the controls. It picks up radio stations really well also. If your looking for just a well built,good clock radio, this is the one, Good price also."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: It is nice and classy, and I guess the sound is ok to be a clock radio. But the handling is complicated - I have never had to read a manual before to operate a clock radio. Also, it's not possible to change to 24h format even though it should be according to the instructions."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Bought this due to great luck with Sangean shower radio and because of difficulty in getting decent reception of two local stations, one AM and one FM.  By relocating the antenna wire both stations are now receivable.  But, this unit has some different controls.  Shutting off the alarm (on clock radio setting) is difficult as once the unit has gone off and snooze has been hit: the only way to turn the alarm off is to turn the radio on - then the button for disabling the alarm will work.  Strange.  Unit is decent but unusual in the way it works."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: After years of having a \"dream machine\" type clock radio, it was time to upgrade. The problems we wanted to solve: better tuner, better reception (yes, we do listen to AM now and then), less harsh light display. Having a digital tuner is a plus, as it allows station presets, so we can switch between stations and not have to retune a wheel. The reception is better, although there is still some fussing where to keep the antenna wire. The light display is orange, not blue, and is much less harsh in the middle of the night. As far as the instructions, we had no problems getting the various bells and whistles to work, and the basic alarm setup  (5 days for one setting, the weekend for the other - Different stations!) was easy and almost intuitive. A bonus is that the clock radio has the three features that go beyond just an alarm - snooze, nap and fall asleep to music. A terrific upgrade!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Works fine. We bought it so my mother-in-law could plug in her pillow speakers.  The sound quality is good.  She likes the large numbers."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I wanted a digital clock radio because there are so many stations in my area and with the usual dial station finder, I always had trouble getting the station I wanted to come in...works great! Thanks...."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I bought this due to its reviews for quality AM reception but the reception is poorer than my inexpensive Target purchased radio alarm clock.  I will be sending this back."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The clock radio does what I expected but has one feature which is bothersome. The unit has an output port for an audio headset which is one of the reasons I bought it. I wake up during the night and sometimes want to listen to the radio without disturbing my wife which I can do using the audio output. The clock radio has another good feature. It allows you do turn the light intensity way down. But, whenever you turn the radio on or select a new station, this light goes to full intensity which disturbs both me and my wife who is sleeping."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I like the sound quality of the clock radio.  Setting the date and time was easy but the alarm settings take lots of time.  Since I haven't yet had time to devote to the instruction book and \"trial and error\", (One Thursday morning, the alarm went off at 3AM),  I am not using the alarm feature at this time.  No big deal.  I bought the radio specifically for the headphone jack and \"nap\" setting.  I fall asleep to talk  radio and listen during the night when I wake and can't get back to sleep.  The radio volume turned low soothes my \"monkey mind\" and the ear buds allow my partner to sleep through."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Love the clock radio, can finally fall asleep to the radio, with timer, using the headphones without disturbing the hubby. Love the way the alarm starts out really quiet and then slowly gets louder, instead of jolting me awake. Easy to use while still asleep and dark, the sleep button, the radio button, etc. Never accidentally turn off the alarm while trying to hit sleep, etc."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This product offers more advanced features for alarm settings as well as the adjustable display light.\nI also like the fact that it uses a 6 volt power supply.  I am running it on a 6 volt solar power system."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a great mono sound radio. Controls are well done and a lot of basic options. It's difficult theses days to find a radion without a ipod dock! Great buy."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great radio. Has all of the features I wanted (specifically digital tuning) for a great price. However, I find the tone is a little too base for listening to AM talk radio. A simple two position tone switch would be a nice addition."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I have been shopping for a clock radio for a long time that had a headphone jack.  This radio has it and others features that I appreciate such as digital tuning and memory buttons.  It sounds good, too!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The sound on this radio is much better than the cheap one I had before.  Setting the alarms takes some getting used to so don't lose the instructions.  I like that you can set up Monday through Friday alarms so the alarm doesn't go off on weekends if you forget to turn it off.  Also like the dual alarms. I was hoping the digital tuner and the antenna wire would bring in more stations but it does not.  It will not pick up the 40 to 60 mile distant stations that I can get on my old boom boxes."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It may just be my aging ears, but I think this radio is somewhat lacking in high frequency response.  Also, I have not had an opportunity to test it under conditions of multi station interference on either FM or AM.\n\nI have it on a bedside table just under a lamp that has a CFL bulb in it.  The bulb puts out significant interference on the AM band, so the radio is useless, (not the radio's fault, however) on AM with the light turned on.  The CFL lamp designers could remedy this simply by installing a single capacitor in their bulb, but that might cost them an additional penny or two at the wholesale level."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This is the clock radio I've been waiting for.\nPros:\n-Headphone jack.  This is huge for me. I've been looking for this on a clock radio for many, many years. Prior to this clock radio, I had a 1980's boom box propped up next to the bed with an earphone bud so I could listen to the radio as I fell asleep without disturbing my wife. I had tried small portable radios, but they all used batteries only and were too easy to fling around while I was sleeping. This radio is stable enough that I haven't yanked it off the nightstand.\n-Digital tuning with presets. Another problem with the 1980's boom box was the manual tuner knob. Too much fiddling with it in the middle of the night and often unsure if I had landed on the right station. My previous clock radio did have presets and digital tuning but no headphone jack, so worthless. On this radio, I usually switch between one AM and one FM station overnight, so switching back and forth only means pressing the \"band\" button at the front right, which is easy to find at night. If I had to find the presets in the middle of the night, that might be trickier as they're in the middle of all the buttons, but I figure I could always apply some kind of raised stickers (like Braille) on those buttons to be able to find them.  Also, concerning buttons, I have not had a problem accidentally hitting the nap button as some have mentioned. When I turn on the radio or turn off the alarm, it's been easy enough for me to locate that one in the dark as it's lighted red and is on the edge of all the buttons (back and on the right).\n-Variable display dimmer. My previous clock radio only had a high and low setting. High was a headlight, low was too dim. Problem solved.\n-Humane waking system. Love this. We gave away another clock radio that had only one setting - induce heart attack. I usually turn off the Sangean alarm at the very beginning when it's still very quiet, but I have been very tired some mornings and needed the extra graduated volume. I let it go to the loudest volume once and I found it to be loud enough for me.\n-Cost and size. Not too expensive I thought, and doesn't take up too much room on the nightstand.\n-Seconds display. When I look at the clock and it reads 5:59 am, I like to know if I have almost one minute to close my eyes or one second. My only complaint here is that when the radio is on (as mine is all night), \"ON\" is displayed instead of the seconds.\nA few minor complaints:\n-Yes, setting the alarm is tricky at first, but in a day I was used to it. To set the alarm time, press the \"1\" or \"2\" alarm button on the back briefly (at first, I kept making the mistake of holding it down for a few seconds, which turns the alarm on or off). This will display the current time set for the alarm. Once the alarm time is displayed (and it goes away in a few seconds if you don't do anything else), then press and hold the \"set\/display\" button until the hours start flashing. Then use the tuning  +\/- buttons to change hours, hit \"set\/display\" again, then the same +\/- for minutes, days of the week, type of alarm. Then to turn on or off the alarms, you press and hold the \"1\" or 2\" buttons.\n-Very loud beep when the alarm is turned on or off. OK, this is annoying if my wife has already fallen asleep and I forget to set the alarm. Same thing if I wake up before the alarm and want to turn it off before it goes off. This should be fixed. Either no beep or a very quiet one would be better.\n-The display changes to VERY bright whenever you do just about anything to the clock radio in the middle of the night (change the band, change the preset, turn the radio on or off). Again, this seems like it could and should be corrected.\n-Radio reception. Not a problem for me as the stations I listen to come in just fine, but one station I used to occasionally listen to (and used to be able to pick up) doesn't come in. I imagine it could be a problem for some.\nDespite the minor complaints, I'm still giving this clock\/radio 5 stars."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Purchased this radio because it had what i wanted in a nightstand radio. Small, FM, alarm, decent reviews. Seems to live up to my expectations so far."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I needed to replace my \"atomic\" alarm clock because it was a huge source of frustration that lacked accuracy and seemed to auto set the time to whatever if felt like when it felt like. After purchasing a new clock radio from a local store that proved to be a colossal piece of junk that I quickly returned I was on a quest to find a good quality NON ATOMIC clock radio with good AM reception, digital tuning, clock lighting that is not so bright it lights up a room, dual alarm and last but not least it had to have aux. in and ear phone options. The Sangean hit all my wants and expectations and then exceeded them. The fully adjustable back light allows you to find the sweet spot for your liking. It has easy to set pre-set buttons. The dual alarms offer flexibility (one time only, M-F, etc) and the Humane Waking System where the alarm progressively gets louder and louder is icing on the cake. The nap timer is a nice little bonus. Heck, I even like the color it is a nice little touch to set itself apart from the competition.\nSome reviewers stated that setting the time and alarms is not intuitive enough and is difficult to set. I am by no means a \"techie\" but my old VCR's never perpetually flashed 12:00 either.  I found the user interface simple to use and after referring to the manual to initially set the time and alarm I will no longer need to do so, it's rather basic stuff.\n\nI highly recommend this clock radio especially if you are fed up with the junk alarms found down at your local box stores. Dollar for dollar, the quality & value you get for this price is superb.\n\n1\/14\/13 Edit to Add: I went to turn on my radio last night before bed and lo & behold the screen was dark as was the lighted power button, no radio, nothing worked, my great new radio up and died. I have already initiated a replacement through Amazon. I am not ready to give up on this radio over this incident, hopefully it was a fluke and I just happened to receive a defective unit. My fingers are crossed the replacement will offer me years of use."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This was a Christmas gift for my wife, so I did a little online research on the Amazon.com website before buying. I read the reviews and was satisfied that it would be a good purchase. I am very impressed with this Sangean RCR-5 Clock Radio. The set-up was very easy, if you just follow the instructions, and it did not take a lot of time. I like how the hour, minutes AND seconds show on the digital face. You have plenty of flexibility in how you set the 2 alarms, the nap timer, and the sleep timer. If you want to wake to the radio, you can select the radio band (AM or FM) and the station, and select two different stations for Alarm 1 vs. Alarm 2. We like the \"Human Wake System\", which is the buzzer alarm mode - the beeps start off low in volume and progressively get louder in volume for one minute, then silent for one minute, and repeat the cycle for one hour. The sound from the radio is clear and crisp. You can preset 5 AM and 5 FM stations. All of the settings are accomplished with buttons, with 2 exceptions - you have a volume wheel on the side and a small display-brightness knob on the bottom of the unit. The unit has a small footprint, and fits nicely on the counter in our bathroom (my wife needs distance between the bed and the alarm clock radio so the snooze button isn't so easy to hit). The power cord has a small transformer plug-in at the wall. All in all, we, and most importantly my wife, are very happy with this Sangean RCR-5 Clock Radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It appears Sangean has taken over where Sony left off.  Sony used to make great clock radios, but their current line-up has only (yes, I know there are a few exceptions) cheap looking, analog - non digital tuning radios. For about $45, this is a good clock radio with a few shortcomings and some nice features.  I selected an AM\/FM radio for reliability.  We don't listen to the radio in the bedroom, so the primary purpose was to wake us up at a specific time.\n\nPROS:\nClock and Alarms easily set - time can be adjusted up AND down from the 'snooze' bar.\nTwo configurable Alarms - with radio OR 'buzzer' but NOT both at the same time\nDigital tuning with Presets for both AM and FM.\nBoth AM and FM seem to have good sensitivity.\nSmall footprint - fits your night table without overtaking all the space.\nWhite case blends nicely into our bedroom, which has white furniture.\n\nCons:\nTinny radio sound.  I've seen some reviews that say the sound is GREAT - they must be tone deaf.  Sorry, this sounds like a cheap table radio - hmmm, well it is only $45.  If you want great sound buy a Bose.\nDigital readout has 'dated' look and the dimmer is adjustable, you have to turn the radio over to get to it. It does not automatically adjust to the room's ambient light.\nManual says backup battery only lasts 10 minutes.  I guess that will be fine for momentary power glitches, but anytime longer will require resetting time, alarms and radio presets.  We don't get a lot of power outages, for us that might not be an issue.\nAlarm adjusting will require reading the manual, not very hard, but not intuitive.\nIt will display Year, Month, Date, but it requires pushing the Clock Adjust button numerous times to see each.\n\nOverall, as noted, I gave it 4 stars.  It does what it's supposed to do, and the price is pretty much on par with the features and performance.\n\nAdded Jan, 2013 - I've had a few months to use this radio and need to add a few comments:\n*Turning OFF the alarm makes a LOUD ANNOYING BEEP - I seem to be able to be up before my alarm goes off, but turning off the alarm emits a very loud BEEP which disturbs my wife - she likes sleeping a bit later than 5:30am.  Also, touching any button puts the LED at full brilliance, lighting up the dark room.  A ambient light sensor for the LED would have been better.\n*The LED is an OLD, cheap type that requires looking DOWN, rather than UP to see the numbers clearly.  So if your night table is higher than your radio, you won't be able to see the numbers very well - If it's lower than your bed NO Problem.  Seems upside down, as I believe most night tables are LOWER than the bed.\n* Human Sleep Alarm, starts low, gradually increases, only works on the BEEP Alarm NOT the Radio.  You will get blasted by the radio whether you like it or not, or take the chance, if set too low, to sleep through the alarm.\n* Just about all the buttons are similar in size, so it's hard to differentiate between them in the dark.  It would be nice if the ALARM OFF button was bigger and placed closer to the front where you could reach it easier.\n* If I could I would re-rate this at 3 Stars."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I just needed a bathroom clock radio w\/plug for Iphone or other devices. I didn't want a docking station since Apple controls the plugs. This radio fit the bill and it has great sound that can be heard over the shower even with the fan on without distortion. I wondered where it was made but could see no designation. Miracle - it must be made in the USA!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I agree with the other reviewers who rate this highly: excellent sound quality and reception. I did have to try different antenna placement for optimal reception as it is near a lamp with a CFL that interferes; but once I found the right place for the antenna (which is a very thin white wire that I don't find bothersome being visible), the reception was much better than any other radio (even less CFL interference than my Bose!)\n\nI saw few other comments about the compact size: it's quite small and that's nice in a bedside radio. I could wish the power button was a slightly different size so easier to find when sleepy... but that's easy to learn.  Another nice feature is this can be adjusted to a *very* soft volume (and still be heard clearly due to fidelity): nice to be able to use as alarm or late listening without disturbing others. This is the first clock radio I've had with preset buttons: this is a nice feature: very easy to sleepily change stations if the pre-set one is not what you want to wake to... or need some \"white noise\" to cancel out sleep-disrupting noise.\n\nI'm not as fond of having the time (numbers) backlit instead of the numbers being the lit area: so much more area that glows... and I'd prefer a softer color than the orange, but being able to change the intensity level allows it to be not too intrusive to sleeping. The numbers are also really big (helpful for the vision-impaired, like me who take off glasses and have to squint in bed). Somehow, the photo doesn't do the actual small size but readable numbers, and the overall appearance justice (the white plastic is quite glossy, which you can't tell in the photo, so it looks \"higher end\" and \"techier\" than I expected): it just looks and \"works\" much better than I had visualized even seeing the photo, once on the bedside table.\n\nAltogether an excellent bedside clock radio.\n\nUPDATE: after a month or so, I have to say the brightness of the orange backlit panel has become a problem: it actually seems to wake me up if I roll over and face right into it. I keep ending up putting a paperback book in front of it to block the light, so I no longer can just look over to see the time. I really wish this had just lighted numbers not a big bright panel of orange light: really bad design flaw. Nonetheless, the rest of the radio functions remain excellent.\n\nUPDATE #2: now after living with this for several months, I do have two large complaints: the light has become bothersome enough that I've ended up blocking it out with a paperback, which means to read the time I really have to wake up enough to navigate rearranging the bedside table: not what you want from a bedside clock! And several times I've inadvertently hit the \"band\" button which is stupidly placed right in front of the off\/on button and the same size: clock radios should be designed for use when semi-conscious... Two rather serious design flaws have made me reduce my rating. Still: lovely fidelity as seems a hallmark of this brand."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I have just had this a couple of days, but here are my early impressions: As a dual alarm it is perfect. Easy to set and use. The nap button is great, and can be set up to 120 minutes. Any more nap than that and let's call it sleep!\nThe adjustable light is great. I don't like to easily see my alarm clock if I get up in the middle of the night, and this can be turned way down. The button to do that is on the bottom.\nAs a radio it is no better or worse than any other radio, with a nice digital timer, 5 presets for AM or FM, and good sound for such a compact unit. It's no Cambridge soundworks, but it also does not cost nearly as much either.\nThe only reason I am not giving this a five is because of the lack of presets. 5 is a bit less than I like. It is an almost perfect, simple and easy to use radio. Instructions to set it up and use were well done."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Bought this to replace an older radio that worked well until my husband knocked it over (but he was vacuuming, so that's ok!):  no - that's NONE, 0, zero - stations would come in, no matter what we tried.  There's a very strong FM station with a transmitter 3 miles from the house - couldn't get it!\nAnd another reviewer was right:  there's no way to set the alarm without the manual, and even then, for example, you have to hold a button for 2 seconds and heaven help you if you linger for 2.5!  Back to the start - again.\nEssentially, this did not function as a radio, or a clock radio, and I've returned it.  Hope the company refunds my money."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I wanted a clock-radio with digital tuning and pre-set buttons and couldn't find one in stores. This clock-radio has an adjustable brightness display, which I love, the audio quality is fantastic for the price, and it has digital tuning with available pre-sets AND an aux-in jack, so I can connect my iPod if I want to. Very happy customer."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is one of the only good clock radios out there left to buy. My old RCA finally quit on me and I had to find a new one. I discovered that most of the new clock radios out there have a mandatory iPhone dock, cheap, tiny buttons and completely unintuitive designs. After searching for weeks for a decent replacement with no luck, my wife found this on Amazon. The Sangean RCR-5 has everything one could expect in a clock radio. It looks good, is intuitively designed and is built solidly.\n\nAs for the people that are saying it is too complicated to operate, let me just say that they are wrong. The design of this clock radio is very intuitive. I will even explain how to set the alarm in one sentence:\n\nPush the alarm button, press and hold the set button for 2 seconds, press the set button again for each desired setting - hour, minute, etc.\n\nIt's that simple. All of the settings have this logic and procedure. All the buttons are laid out on top in an easy to remember grid. Once you know where the buttons are, you don't even have to look at them.\n\nThe sound quality is surprisingly good. The reception is great if you use the antenna wire properly (try tacking it up the wall a bit).\n\nIf you are looking for a good clock radio without all the iPhone docking nonsense, this is the one to buy."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio does all I want even though I have not used all of the features. I bought this radio because I wanted an earphone jack and sleep timer for the radio. Once you get used to the button locations and what they are for it is easy to operate even in the dark. Very happy with this purchase."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I bought this because I was looking for a clock radio with a digital tuner.  The radio is ok -- the reception isn't great, but if I move the antennae around my stations come in fine.  But the rest of the alarm clock is incredibly annoying.\n\nSetting the alarm is not at all intuitive.  I can do it, but each time I want to change the alarm I have to consult the manual.  I thought after a few months of owning the clock, the controls would start to make more sense, but they just don't.\n\nThe snooze button is kind of hard to push.  You really have to find the exact right button, then apply direct pressure down -- but only in the center of the button.  (By contrast, with my old clock you could just slap a very large button in the front, and it would snooze.)  If you press on the right or left side of the button, you change the radio station and then the snooze option is gone, as far as I can tell.\n\nIt only snoozes for just under one hour.  If you are the type of person who snoozes the alarm several times before waking up, you really do risk oversleeping.  I have, a few times now.\n\nThe alarm options are either every day, weekdays, or weekends.  There is no M\/W\/F option - with electronics these days, it shouldn't be outrageous to just set what days you want it to go off.\n\nOverall, the functionality is just blah.  I gave it two stars because it does actually work, it is just poorly designed."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: Why make it so complicated when it could have been so simple.  To much push buttons, once, twice, one more time, for a week, two days, once, music, buzz, the date,......\nCannot just set the wake-up , for once, on or off.\nOr just a setting wheel, or and on-off for the fonction.\nWould not buy again.\nAnd the antena is not the ac cable.\nIf not at the right place, lots of noise."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I wanted a bedside clock radio with presets, and that's what I got.\nI like the form of it, its a nice size, not too big. The reception is very good.\nI'm not fond of the orange display,though I do like the dimmer function.\nWould have liked a countdown on the sleep timer, had it on my old radio and really liked it.\nAs said in other reviews some buttons are indistinguishable from one another, occasional press of the wrong button as such, not a big deal for me.\nProbably the biggest issue imo would be the alarm, even when it gets up to full volume on the buzzer it isn't very loud,\nI certainly would not rely on it, which is why I use my cellphone as a backup, so once again not a big deal for me.\nBasically I just use it for listening to the radio while I drift off to sleep.\nOverall I'm pleased with it"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am happy with this purchase. It does everything I wanted it to do. I had to spend an extra $20.00 NZ to get a NZ compatible plug. I never thought about that. But I am happy thanks Sandi M"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I like the ease of operation and sound quality.  A good buy.  Only thing I would change is adding a different color for the \"nap\" button so I wouldn't keep hitting it in the dark."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: pros: great sound in radio, like the beeping alarm\n\ncons: buttons hard to find when sleeping, they feel the same. hard to read the time....not enough contrast"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I really needed a good quality clock radio with a digital tuner and this seems to fit the bill. Nice features and soound (not tinny) It took a little while to get used to the slightly complex settings\/operations. All in all, very satisfied"}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This radio has every single thing I was looking for but one small thing. (Otherwise I would give it 5 stars).  I wanted a radio, made elsewhere than China, for the least amount of money, that looked nice, was durable, had a MP3 output, a dimmer mode, a sleep timer; and I couldn't be happier with this radio. The features involving all those things are just luxurious.  Things were well-thought out. I can't believe how great the cost for how great the quality. It even feels substantial.  The only thing I would request is that there be no sounds when setting the alarm; or at least a mode that allows that.  I have to remember to set the alarm BEFORE my husband goes to bed, or I wake him up with the beep the clock radio makes when setting the alarm."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The dimmer on the light is what really makes this for me- I usually point bedside clocks towards the wall after getting annoyed by the brightness. This clock has a dimmer dial taking the back light down to 0- just above zero is perfect for making the time visible in pitch black without being too bright. The downside of the dimmer is that it's a small dial on the underside- I'd prefer something on top to adjust the clocks brightness for daytime and back easily, this dial seems designed to be set and left alone. Like all Sangean's the build quality is high, but for $40, you'd expect that. The plastic is thick, the buttons and dials all feel solid, and the overall this seems very well made. My two main qualms with the clock are the inability to not view seconds (I just find the constant movement annoying) and the lack of decent AM reception (the FM reception is great)."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Looking for a small bedside radio with 2 alarms and ability to turn itself off, so I can go to sleep listening to music.  Works well.  Would like a better antenna."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent  reception.  Sound is about what is to be expected from a small radio.  Setting the alarm is unnecessarily complicated.  I use the alarm that is built into my TV set instead.  Keeps time very accurately. Not sure why there isn't a 'real' battery back up but only a 10 minute one -- an important feature of a clock radio.  One thing that is possibly a poor design is the push buttons. They make a cheap 'click' noise and is probably what will send it to the landfill before anything else.  It is one of the best looking clock radios in its price range, but it is an off-white color, not brilliant-white like in the pictures, if that matters.  I definitely recommend this item."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The digital display is bright and the preset stations make changing stations an easy task.\nI am very satisfyed with the purchase of this item.\nThanx amazon and Sangean!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Everything came in great,on time,packaged properly. All the features were as explained. The reason why I only gave 3 stars was because the radio reception should be much better. I do get some stations somewhat clearly but even FM does not come in clear. The FM antenna is almost no help. Wish reception was better, don't know how to fix."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is EXACTLY what I was looking for!  This sits by my computer at my desk.  The antenna gives me clear reception of my radio stations.  I can preset five FM stations and five AM stations and have them available at the press of a button.  The clock has large numbers, easy to read when it's dark or when I'm getting glare from the window.  Everything is very easy to set up.  I couldn't be happier with it!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am very happy with this alarm clock. It has a lot of features and also allows for adjusting the brightness of the digital clock. Also, the radio sounds pretty good for it's size, if you like to wake up to the sound of music."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: We have been trying to use this clock-radio for the local NPR stations, but the selectivity of the FM tuner is not up to the task. The more powerful FM rock and roll stations just overwhelm the tuner. Careful adjustment of the FM antenna wire helps some, but not enough.  I think we have to try another clock-radio.  Our old Boston Acoustics Solo did much better, before it died."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: An excellent radio with all the bells & whistles. However, it has a very bright display and dimming it produces intolerable static on the AM band.\n\nSangean support says this is \"normal\" so I had to return it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I really like this alarm clock a lot except that after you dim the display to the lowest setting, it still casts an annoying yellow light in your bedroom.\n\nOther than that the sophisticated functions are great and the alarm setting isn't really that difficult for anyone who's used to gadgets."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Pros:  I bought this clock radio to replace an Emerson Smart set that I got cheap at Target.  It used to have good reception, but something happened.  This new clock has excellent reception for those pesky hard to tune in NPR stations.  It also has push buttons for your favorite stations which I like.\n\nCons: It's hard to see at night, and especially for my husband way over on the other side of the bed and without his glasses.  The Emerson has a black background and red LED lights - big - that are really easy to read and don't give off too much extraneous light.  This guy is backlit which is controllable but that means you've got a glowing yellow light right next to you all night.  And, my husband can't read it from the other side.  What's so hard about the LED concept?  I ended up leaving both radios on the nightstand, one for viewing the time, one for the radio.  Also, the way you operate it is a little tricky but once you get it, it's handy.  A little like learning a new software program.  Would I get another one of these?  Probably.  Hope the Sangean lighting engineers are reading this."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this radio as a replacement because living within in a mile of a local airfield makes AM reception iffy at best with an analog tuner.  The digital tuner has much better reception and is easy to program."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I have had this clock radio for a couple of years now.  It does have the nice digital radio station tuning, but the station buttons are the middle 5 of 9 in-line buttons.  So you have to count the first two buttons in the row to find the tuning buttons.\n\nAs one reviewer pointed out, they had to consult the manual to do the simplest thing like changing the alarm time.  I find the \"sleep\" turn-off and nap modes just too complex to use without the manual.  Every other clock radio I used had a single button you could push to give you an hour of radio, then turn off.\n\nWhy did I throw the Sangean across the room?  On a recent night I must have hit the wrong button going to bed.  Just after drifting off to sleep the darned thing started beeping.  I pushed a couple buttons but could not stop it.  Not having very good cognition in that sleepy state, I chose the only option available.  I picked up the radio and tossed it.  But it was still beeping so I located its power supply and unplugged that.  There, silence.\n\nSuffice it to say that I am looking for another clock radio.  If there were one with the simple controls of my 20 year old GE, but had electronic tuning instead of the GE's analog dial, I would buy it in a minute.  One should not have to be fully awake, reading a manual to perform basic functional operations on their bedroom clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: recvd the clock radio in good shape - alarm & radio worked fine -  but after about a month the digital clock started losing time - about 5 mins per week - it was out of the sellers return period so i am in the process of returning to sangean"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Bought this radio to listen at night while in bed, mostly talk and news shows  I was impressed by all the reviews, and thought the price was decent.  When I tried it out I was so disappointed at the 'tubby' sound, and had difficulty understanding the dialogue. My cheapie 12 year old radio had better accoustics.  So I returned it.  I must add kudos to Amazon for the ease of the return.  Anyway, maybe I just got a lemon.  But that's just my experience with it."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Had an older analog radio with an awful \"indiglo\" clock and needed to replace it. Read the reviews for the RCR5 and felt for the modest $$ that it would be a good replacement...very similar features to a SONY Dream Machine we have in another room.\nPros...nice and compact, pll digital tuning, nicely lit and legible clock, decent sound, aux input.\nCons...not crazy about the gray colored side panels, but just a minor issue. Only 10 minute internal battery backup...never heard of such a limited backup time\nOther..some reviewers mentioned about confusing\/complicated alarm setting procedures...the procedure itself is not overly complicated, however following the written instructions for the first time that include some awkward \"chin-glish\" translations can make the experience a little frustrating.\nOverall, quite happy with the RCR5 so far and would have given 5 stars except for my cons."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Just what I needed - no bells or whistles.  My only complaints are that it doesn't have battery back up and is hard to read from far away (unlike a clock where the numbers are bright green \/ red).  Other than that, I like the ability to set the clock for only weekdays.  That's it's best feature."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very pleased with radio, sound is great, the alarm goes from a gentle wake up, then more and more urging as time passes. Love the Mon-Fri alarm clock feature too."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I got this because I needed a radio with digital tuning in order to keep multiple religious stations from crowding out public radio on a former radio that could not stay on the station. There weren't many choices for digital-tuning clock radios so I took a chance on this.\nBut I agree with reviewers who said they found the steps needed to set the alarm to be too complicated and confusing. Indeed, I found the setting of alarms not only confusing and ridiculously complicated, but the manual's directions don't even match what actually happens when you follow them in an attempt to set an alarm. I have never succeeded in getting the combination of type\/time of alarm on certain days of the week.\nI will be sending this back."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This little radio is awesome.  You would swear it's stereo, but it actually only has one speaker.  The sound quality is very good.  The digital tuning is excellent.  It's very compact too...the sound is much better than of the one speaker clock radios in the $17-$25 price range.  Buy one, you'll love it.  Sangean makes a good product."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was sorry to return this mostly nice clock.\nGood things:\n- Good AM FM sound and tuning\n- Alarm goes off even if you have the radio on (can lay in bed in the morning listening to the radio, and the alarm will still tell you to get up)\n- Nap alarm\n- Nice size and style\n- Functions quite intuitive. You can guess how to set stations, set alarms, etc.\n\nIssues:\n- Automatic clock setting didn't work for me (that would have been nice). This might be location dependent.\n- Alarm clock setting very nice for those who get up at the same time several days a week, but a bit fussy for those of us who rise at a different time every day.\n- As with most electronics, too many identical buttons. This radio was better than most in having a wheel for volume, a bar for -\/+ and buttons on the front and top.  The top and front buttons, however, were difficult to work without looking at them to see what they did.\n- Date display not particularly useful, and takes up way too much of the display box.\n\nFatal Flaw:\n- The display box is highly back lit.  I don't know why.  It would be much easier to read without the back light.  Also, the back light is so bright it lights up the room at night.  Yes, you can turn the display down, but the digits become unreadable long before the display is dim enough to sleep next to.\nI had to turn the clock away to sleep, and if I wanted to know the time at night I had to rotate the clock back.  I called the company to see if this was a flaw or if I could turn off the back light and they said no.  Not being able to read the clock at night without having to reach over to fiddle with it was just not worth it, despite it's many other excellent features.\nThis was the one and only reason I returned the clock.  I haven't found a replacement.  Suggestions?"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great clock radio. Simple and elegant with all the required features - preset, snooze, auto timer off, decent signal strength ( not great !! ) . The\nbest part is the illumination setting. You can have it bright enough to check the clock, yet - no so much to bother your wife or yourself. For the price at $40, you cannot really ask for anything better !!!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am generally satisfied with this item and my complaints were covered thoroughly by other buyers in previous reviews but I'll share my quibbles anyway.\nI've never had a backlit clock radio before and have concluded that they are less than ideal - I would rather the numbers be lit and on a dimmer because they are easier to read day and night.  And why is the dimmer dial on the bottom of the product instead of the side and so tiny?  I have slim fingers and it's a bit of a stretch.\nI live in a radio signal hole and as expected several of the stations I was hoping this radio would pick up are pure static.  Disappointing.\nThe button design could be more tactile friendly but considering I use this daily I pretty much know the layout by touch now.\nOther notes, this is more attractive and modern looking than I expected which is a good thing and I really like that when the radio alarm comes on in the morning it is not preceeded by a loud click which nearly all of my clock radios of the past have done - the radio is just suddenly on and I am not jolted awake.\nI think that covers it.  I urge you to read through everyone's reviews to decide what you can and can't live with.  I can live with the things I'm not crazy about."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I had been looking for a radio with pre-set station buttons----not an easy task.  After wasting time in stores I found this one on Amazon.  I'm really impressed with the reception and function of this radio.  Because of the excellent reception I'm able to listen to stations I couldn't with my previous radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I;ve gone through 4 radios looking for one that could sit on my nightstand.  One had two dimness settings -- lighthouse or totally dark.  My wife couldn't sleep with the bright setting and I couldn't read the time on dim.  This clock has variable dimness -- set it at whatever balance works.  Another was too complicated and had too many buttons.  Half asleep when I turned off the alarm, I'd always accidently hit some other button causing the alarm to go off at some unscheduled time, like 3:00 am.  Once you get this clock programmed, you essentially do everything with the same button.  So uncomplicated.\n\nIt's an attractive addition to the room.  My entire family marvels at how cute it looks.  Nice sound and good reception (I've read some reviews complaining about the reception.  As far as I can tell, all you need to do is adjust the antenna wire).\n\nI am very happy with this purchase.  So happy, that I am writing my first product review for Amazon."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Full disclosure, the first one of these I got was defective. The radio part did not work at all. However I returned it easily and the replacement worked well right out of the box. The best part is the reception. I have an inside office in a part of town where radio reception is notoriously bad, but this one, with the included antenna does better than any radio I have had here. The sound is hardly HiFi as it is one speaker, but for talk radio it is plenty good and even for music it is more than tolerable if you are not a music snob. The digital tuning and presets are the key thing I was looking for. I hate having to refind the station when I change. These set easily and now I can flip back and forth as I want to avoid commercials. For the price, you would be hard pressed to do better.\n\nLater note. I still like this radio but I have found one annoying feature: the nap button sits right next to the power and the \"band\" buttons. It is easy to hit accidentally and it then sets the radio to come on at a later time. Annoying when you intended to turn it off. I ended up putting a piece of tape over that button. No biggie I guess but annoying."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is an attractive clock radio. It has a good AM\/FM digital tuner and the sound is good for a radio this size. The display brightness is continuously adjustable down to very dim - useful  near my bed when I am sleeping. I recommend it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The main reason I decided to purchase this alarm clock was for the soothing orange color of the dimmable display.  The display can be adjust so it will not illuminate your bedroom any more than is needed.  Our previous alarm clock had an awfull blue display that would keep my wife awake at night.  Now my wife sleeps soundly and thus so do I.  I recommend ths product.  The only reason for only four stars is at this price point it would have been nice to have on screen weather or nature sounds as an option."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: For a long time I've been annoyed by the fact that I couldn't find a small and simple, quality alarm clock, that didn't look like the egg of some cycloptic space creature. If I spent more money, the clocks would only get bigger, with more useless features, like a CD player, but the quality always remained at the threshold of being utterly useless. Tuners that mix together stations and fade in and out, horrible sounding speakers etc. I know you know what I mean. Chinese crap!\n\nEnter the Sangean RCR-5. Made in California USA, this alarm clock has the solid build, classy appearance, quality sound production, and appropriate size that, to me, represents what an alarm clock should be. The five different radio station presets are easy to program and use. There's two separate buttons for two different alarm times, so if you're like my wife and have two different times to rise during the week, it's as easy as holding down the Alarm 1 or 2 buttons for 2 seconds till it beeps. BTW, some reviewers mentioned complexity in programing the clock and\/or alarms. I didn't see it. I found all the programming to be quite intuitive, and needed to glance at the instructions only briefly. My wife and I had all the features, times, and presets down within 10 minutes.\n\nThe one flaw that keeps this excellent product from having 5 stars is that if your night stand is higher than your bed, you may have a little trouble reading the numbers at night. Even from straight on our clock's numbers have a faded appearance, only darkening when your perspective changes to one that is higher than the clocks face. It's a minor thing for me, but my wife is vision-challenged without her glasses or contacts, and at night she has to strain to make out what the clock says, which wakes her up. Not a good thing. If you don't have vision problems, or your bed is even with or higher than your night stand, this shouldn't be a factor, and I highly recommend this product."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It came in a secure package, it came in a timely manner. It was easy to understand the instructions and it has been working beautifully."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this to be a bathroom FM radio, to receive three preselected NPR stations and one preselected all classical music station. I needed the clock but not the alarm. I got what I wanted and then some.\n\nThis little radio, with no antenna augmentation, pulls in a kazillion stations with clarity. The local stations I wanted are clear and clean. Over time I\"ll explore the others.\n\nThe fidelity is adequate for my needs and what you would expect from a small plastic box.\n\nI need a high quality radio for another room; I will now consider another Sangean model."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: So, first the warnings....there is no backup battery and the display could use some improvement.\n\nThe clock has grey\/black LCD type display with an illuminated background.  So if you want a lot of contrast, you have to turn up the background brightness.  When I got it adjusted so the time was easy to read, the background was giving off so much light that it was distracting at night.  I'm keeping the background light level low so I can get to sleep, but can barely read the time at night.\n\nBut for my use, I am quite happy with this clock radio.  Small, nicely designed, a ton of useful functions, easy to use and has great sound for the size.\n\nSo, I took one star off for the display issue.  A backup battery would be nice, but it wasn't listed as a feature ... I just need to learn to read the descriptions."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: After trying several other brands in our location, and after buying a Sangeon Shower Radio (which is the absolute best), we bought this clock radio. It was the only one that has been able to sort out the many other nearby stations and noise to give us a solid, clear signal on our favorite PBS FM radio station (a relatively low power station) here in Spokane Valley, WA.  We live right below several mountain top radio\/TV antennas on one side and a few blocks from another radio tower on the other side.  We used to get nothing but noise on certain days, or multiple signals all on top of each other.  Now we have a rock solid, clear signal all the time.  The sound from the speaker is way bigger and clearer than you would expect from its size, and all the controls are easy to understand and use.  A display light adjustment on the bottom is very useful in bringing down the level of brightness during the night.  The display brightens to max if you hit any buttons, but after a short delay goes back to the setting you arranged for night display.  All in all, a great buy, even though it is not the cheapest.  You definitely get what you are paying for, and more."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I bought several of these radios -- good price, good looks, but I couldn't get a favorite station that I get on other radios in the apartment"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Love this radio!  Volumn control dial very exact.  Easy to read and tune.  Great button programing. Super for bedroom or bath.  Added feature of earphone plug in."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love this radio.  I specifically searched for a radio with station presets, dual alarms, and a headset plug.  This radio has everything I wanted and more!  Although I wasn't specifically looking for the \"human wake\" feature, my husband and I both really appreciate it.  The reception is great too.  All my favorite stations come in loud and clear.  I fall asleep with a radio on and this radio allows me to listen to it using the sleep timer with headsets on so that I do not disturb my husband. The time for the sleep timer is also selectable.\nThe only downside to this radio is the display is a little hard to read."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a very nice radio.  The presets are easy to set, and I love the adjustable backlight on the display.  The sleep button is easy to operate.  The headphone plugin was a necessity.  The only quibble I have is that I am unable to tune in any AM stations.  This is not the fault of the radio, as we are a distance from the transmitters, and the signals are blocked because of the steel siding on our house.  Other than that, it's a great little radio!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Was happy with the ease of setup-w\/o looking at the manual!!!  Sound is so much better than the Sony it replaced and the buttons are sensitive to touch.  Hard to find this product and am very happy with the purchase."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: After a recent purchase of the Sangean RCR-5 radio I was slightly disappointed. We have a Sangean table radio which pulls in stations great, but this radio has a hard time pulling in the same stations. I expected more from this radio because of the performance we have had with Sangean in the past. This radio just doesn't live up to the Sangean name."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I like this radio. But it has some serious ergonomic design problems.\n\nBackground. I don't sleep well and ususally wake up during the night.  I find it helpful when falling asleep to have a radio playing. I need to be able to change staions in the dark and I need an external speaker plug to attach a pillow speaker. I also need to be able to dim the display since lights interupt my sleep. I had a Sangean rcr-22 which broke after 4 years of usage. It also had problems. I wanted something better.\n\nThe rcr-5 was similar to the rcr-22 but was cheaper and did not have the \"atomic clock\" feature which never worked in New York City. I am too far from the broadcast antenna in Colorado and am near too many tall buildings that block the signal.\n\nThe rcr-5 has all the basic features I needed. The sound quality is good. The station reception is good.\nBasically it works OK for my needs. Reception seems a little better than the rcr-22. The display back light can be dimmed so it does not disturb my sleep but can still be seen in the dark. On the RCR-22 the dimmest setting for the backlight was too bright and I had to turn off the display at night.\n\nThe rcr-22 had 7 station pre-sets each for AM and FM. The rcr-5 has only 5 each. That is enough for me, but might not be enough for other people. The display on the rcr-22 had more information than the rcr-5. The rcr-22 showed the date and\/or the preset station number in addition to the time.\n\nThe real problem with the rcr-5 is the placement of the preset buttons. The top row has 9 adjacent buttons with identical feel. Starting from the left are 2 alarm set buttons. Next are the 5 preset buttons. Then the \"snooze\" button and then the power on\/off button. It is just too easy, in the middle of the night to try to change the radio station by touch and accidently to turn on or off an alarm or accidently hit the snooze button. Bad button placement. I had to put some tape over the alarm and snooze buttons so I could tell them apart from the pre-set stations by feel. The button placement was not great on the rcr-22, but the pre-sets were not next to the alarms. That means fewer accidents."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I was really just looking for a clock radio with a digital tuner and good quality sound.  Especially at the price this was perfect for my needs.  One of the best thought out set of controls I have seen.  Nothing really negative for my needs. Quite easy to set up with minimal reading of user guide.  As others have said there is no battery backup (settings retained for 10 min max)which does not bother me but could be a killer for those making frequent use of alarm in areas with power loss problems."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I agree with all of the most positive comments made above.  This clock radio is small, compact and attractive.  The sound quality is very good and it's the easiest clock radio I have had to program."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I live about 60 miles outside of New York City.  Most radio stations are based in the city.  Reception was spotty with most alarm clock radios because of the location.  So I was searching for an alarm clock with good \"ears\" and I found it.  AM and FM reception are important to me.  The Sangean radio has been a champ.  It able to provide a good strong sound with minimal static.  The tones are good for the size of the radio.  I waited two months prior to submitting this review to make sure I knew all the aspects of this radio.  I love the ability to pick the days of the week for the alarm for each of the two alarm slots, as well as the one time alarm setting that allows you to insert a special one time alarm setting.  I am a tech type person and the navigation through alarm set up was not intuitive but it doable.  I wish the unit had a longer battery backup system.  The capacitor type only survies short dips in power, not the longer hour long interruptions that some time happen in the suburbs.  For the price I am very happy and would buy a Sangean radio again in a heart beat."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Let me tell you what I like about the Sangean RCR 5.  It has two alarms plus a separate sleep function and can be programmed for 5 FM stations and 5 AM stations.  I can go to sleep listening to AM talk radio, wake up to news on an FM station with one alarm function and then go to my favorite music station with the second alarm function - all programmed and set up in advance.  The wire antenna pulls in FM stations that other radios can't touch.  Sangean is known for AM reception, which is great.  Because it is a digital tuner, the AM does not drift and the FM stays solid.  I purchased a small computer speaker system with sub-woofer and plugged it into the earphone jack.  It makes my clock radio sound like a full stereo system.  As you can see, I'm very pleased with it.  In fact, so pleased that I bought two more for other locations."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I bought this clock radio because it had digital tuning, a feature I wanted for easily switching between two local public radio stations.  My current GE radio, vintage about 1990, picks up both stations clearly so I did not think a more technically sophisticated radio would have any trouble.  There does not seem to be any specification for reception capability from the manufacturer.\n\nHowever, when I got the new radio, the weaker of the two stations was nowhere to be heard.  The radio has a nice feature of incrementing the reception band but even the smallest could not find the station.  It did, however, find a persistent, scratchy HipHop station in the desired location.  Searching up and down the scale over several days of varying weather and various antenna positions never changed that.  I returned the radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was looking to replace my clock radio and stumbled across this.\n\nPositive feedback:\n\n#1: Has an adjustable brightness for the display\n#2: Has a head phone jack\n#3: Has a AUX IN jack (for CD, mp3 and other digital music players)\n#4: Has two programmable alarms (in case you need to get up at different times on different days of the week)\n#5: Great sound quality for AM and FM\n#6: 12 or 24 hour time display\n\nNegative feedback\n\n#1: Does not allow you to change the sleep time. (defaults to 5 minutes)\n\nAside from the non adjustable sleep time, this clock radio is well worth the money. I highly recommend it."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This clock radio fails to pick up a local station.  I have never had that problem with at least 8 other devices, including one cheapo.  Furthermore, I always set my alarms with the radio to go off first, and 5 minutes later, the buzzer.  Usually works for me.  But the buzzer begins softly, grows louder, and after one minute it stops and waits silently for a minute before beginning softly again and growing louder, then off for a minute.  I keep falling asleep between loud parts.  Also, I am used to a clock that, when I stop one alarm, the other continues.  In other words, when I turn off the second, the buzzer, the first radio alarm continues on, then turns itself off after the usual radio alarm time.  But this one stays off.  I have to manually turn it on to catch the weather and traffic, and remember to turn it off during the morning rush out the door. This last seems minor, but it is surprisingly annoying."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I purchased this alarm clock a week ago.  These are my initial impressions.\n\nRadio.  It is a great radio with a digital Tuner.  I really like the presets.  I listen to my baseball team on AM radio in the evening and my FM Morning show.  It is so easy to switch back and forth between these two.  That is just awesome.  However the radio will not blow you away, but I mainly use this radio for talk shows and it is perfect for that.\n\nClock.\nThis is probably the weakest area of the radio.  It would be awesome if the radio had an auto dimmer for night.  The great thing is that you can dim this alarm clock as much as you want so that it doesn't disturb your sleep.  Some clock radios just have 3 settings uber-bright, super-bright, and bright.  Then where the weakness comes in is that when it's dim the alarm clock is pretty much unreadable during the day.\n\nAlarm.\nThe alarm seems fine.  It is different than my last radio. It is a little hard to use, but not impossible.  I like the gradually louder beeping.\n\nAUX IN\/Headphone\nThese 2 settings are great.  It adds to the flexibility of the radio.  If I wanted to bring it to work, or put on headset at night, or listen to my ipod it could do all of these things.  GREAT.\n\nOverall it is a great clock radio.  I never rock out with my clock radio.  I have much nicer equipment in the house for that.  The misses clock radio is visible during the day.  I really like the 5 presets on both AM\/FM.  In two seconds I can switch between stations, or AM\/FM.  This is exactly what I wanted."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Loved it when I first got it, but since then I've noticed the station tuning (supposedly digital) wanders, and there's nothing I can do about it, since each station is set where it's supposed to be. I love the digital push buttons to go to different stations, and that's why I bought this item.\n\nThe included antenna is woefully inadequate, and there's no external metal part to attach a real antenna to.\n\nWorst of all, the audio quality is very low fi. Disappointingly so. I'm considering jig-sawing into the box and connecting a decent Radio Shack bookshelf speaker, though I'm not sure where I'd put it. I liked that it all fits on my night table. I never use it as an alarm clock.\n\nVery disappointed."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This was a gift for someone who wanted a small clock-radio with digital preset buttons.  It works well and looks great!  The manual with it was written by someone not very familiar with our English language, but it is passable. This clock-radio has many practical features not found on those in local stores. It is well-worth the money."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I use this in my office and it picks up radio, both AM and FM very good.  I needed two things, good reception and a audio out jack for my external speakers (yes this has its own speaker, but I wanted to use others) this does both."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great little radio.  Was looking for small radio with presets and audio out jack for headphones and worked as advertised.  I would recommend it.  Wire antenna needs adjustment to get some stations."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: We researched clock radios for a long time before purchasing this one. We are very pleased with the ease of use and the sound quality of this radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This is an attractive item with extraordinary sound quality. Yet,I have to repress the urge to take a sledge hammer to it nearly every time I try to set the alarm.\n\nThere is nothing intuitive about the design. The cool-looking buttons are small and give one little indication what each one is for. I have to pull out the manual and refresh my memory every time I want to set it. If you wear glasses or contacts forget it.\n\nThe benefits of the sound system, along with the features, not to mention the sleek design, are a waste of money if you actually plan to use this item to wake up.\n\nAnother Sangean product we own has a similar problem. Hey Sangean, if you're listening: Keep having your techies build quality components; but have a normal person who actually needs to wake up in the morning help design the settings.\n\nFS (using my wife's account)"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I purchased this clock radio at Christmas time for my wife and I. I have returned it because we can not see it at night, or in the early morning.  Part of this is due to where we place it, atop a high cabinet past the foot of our bed.  The screen of this unit is not easily seen from below horizontal. But, even when I propped up the back, we could not make out the time from in bed. There is not enough contrast difference between the digits and the background.  This unit might work okay from a nearby nightstand.\nThe radio portion worked really well. I selected this unit based on review comments on the radio, and it lived up to expectation.  Our favorite station is a bit weak and is right between two more powerful ones.  This radio did great at pulling in our station and staying on it.  I did need to change a setting in order to make minor adjustments to the frequency.\nSetting and using the alarm is a bit strange, although the instructions do provide the details.  They are just not intuitive. So, while everything worked out fine while I had instructions in-hand, when the alarm went off, it was frustration time. The sleep-snooze button is large, and well placed. But, the alarm shutoff is a small button near the back. If one hits the sleep button first, then it seems difficult (read as never figured it out) to shut that alarm off.\nProbably would have kept the alarm if we could have seen the time.  I expect we would have learned how to use the functions correctly."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The radio seems real nice except you cant read the time unless you are directly in line with the display.  Unfortunately I cant use it for an alarm clock because of this issue.  Otherwise it seems like it is a quality build that is fairly easy to use thew controls on.  I like the digital tuning and analog volume control."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am beyond pleased with this clock radio --- quite literally the best one I have ever had.\nHave tried (and given away) one after another;  now, at long last, this little radio does it all.\n\nThe one thing I was particularly looking for was reception: living in the mountains, our radio reception\nis less than optimal.  With various radios throughout the house, with fair to less-than-fair\nreception, this one is wonderful!!!  Good sound quality ( from this little box) - never-fading reception -\nwow!\nLove the easily managed display - the yellow is easy on the eyes, unlike the rather awful BRIGHT blue of others I\nhave tried.\nCannot recommend this one highly enough!!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I looked around for a while trying to find a clock radio with all the features I was looking for without breaking the bank. This one comes oh so close to being exactly what I wanted. The main attributes I was looking for was a digital tuner, an adjustable back light, and individual button presets. This unit has all these and more. Everything else is super easy to use and well thought out. Multiple settings for the alarm (everyday, weekdays, weekends, once). The soft amber light of the back light is perfect. I can easily see the time without lighting up the room at all. The only minuses are limited battery back up (built in battery only last 10 minutes in an outage), no station scan for the tuner, and a relatively weak antenna. There were a couple of weaker stations in Sacramento I was hoping to get but don't. All in all I am quite pleased with the purchase and will be keeping it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I really like most of the features of this clock radio except the HWS (humane wake system). As time progress I have found that I have tended to sleep 15-45 minutes past the alarm time. Being such a heavy sleeper, I have noticed a tendency to incorporate the alarm into my dreams or just ignore it. I think they should have the ability to disable the HWS and have the alarm adjustable."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this clock radio having read previous buyers' pros and cons. I found that the \"cons\" did not add up to much. Yes, the manual is not well written, but it does cover the necessary basics to get going with this device. I still find myself fumbling a bit in the mornings as my fingers learn the landscape of buttons that are new to my touch. But I have faith that I'll get there. What I especially like about this clock\/radio are the available features for setting the alarm(s). I really like having two alarms and use them both. I feel like this represents money well spent."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was looking for a small, AM\/FM clock radio for the nightstand - I didn't need any kind of ipod dock, CD player, external speakers, etc - but it HAD to have an earphone jack (for listening to late night talk radio) and adjustable display brightness; and it had to run on AC (no batteries) and not take up half the nightstand; also I was hoping for under $50. This combination of features (or non-features) was actually hard to fine, and the Sangean turned out to be it. I was a bit reluctant to order this at first due to some of the negative comments on reception, but I get perfect reception on both AM & FM. Also, the controls are very intuitive and easy to learn and use - no 50 page instruction manual required. I rated sound at 3 stars, but it is acceptable for its size, and I use Skull Candy headphones anyway Skull Candy Chrome (also very good product). Great radio, came in original packaging in 4 days with super saver savings."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: After spending hours upon hours looking for an attractive dual alarm clock radio, I stumbled upon this Sangean one. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing (pictures do not do it justice - it has a very simple, mid-century look to it) - but it is incredibly easy to set and use. I cannot tell you how pleased we are with this clock. With the endless amount of junk out there - in ugly silver and techy designs, this Sangean is a refreshing change. (NOTE: I never ever take the time to write product reviews but had to make an exception for this!)."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I was concerned by some of the reviews so I was on edge when it was delivered. I was pleasently surprised. If you can handle the functions on a cell phone, you can handle this. Remember, this is a clock radio. Not a Hi-Fi stereo and doesn't make your coffee. But no more using that little wheel to find stations. Its digital and has preset. Nap function is awsome and the alarm starts out soft and slowly rises till you wake up. Not the instant airhorn that can put you into cardiac arrest. It is the most I have ever spent on a clock radio, but I think you will find the many features are worth it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Boy, did I want a clock radio with presets.  And on that dimension, this product satisfies.  However, it has three key shortcomings that bother me:\n\n1.  The reception -- in my case -- is no better than the old analog tuner clock\/radio it replaced.\n\n2.  The on\/off switch is unreliable.  I'd say two times in three I have to hit it twice to get it to perform.  This applies for both ON and OFF.\n\n3.  The alarm set feature beeps!  Perhaps there's a way to disable this, but I haven't found it.  This is really annoying -- empirical testing shows that the beep is loud enough to wake my sleeping wife.  So if she's asleep, and I need to change the alarm time, I resort to my watch alarm.  I'd love to hear what the design engineers were thinking when they programmed this feature, because the merit of the beep is truly lost on me.\n\nOn the plus side, the unit is attractive.  The aforementioned presets are wonderful (and should be emulated by other manufacturers).  And the numbers are big enough \/ bright enough for my very near-sighted eyes to see in the night.\n\nI'm not junking it.  But if I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't buy this alarm."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: All the functions you need for a clock radio.\n5 presets for stations\neasy to use functions with well written instructions\nbest radio for the money"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I looked high and low for the right alarm clock -the radio was a bonus.  It's so hard to find an alarm with a tolerable alarm sound, which was the highest priority on my list and Sangean has the Humane Wake System alarm.  It slowly wakes you with a soft pleasant sound that doesn't terrify you out of your sleep.  After all, who wants to wake up with a speeding heart rate to start your day.  You would think that the manufacturers would allow you to actually hear a sound bite sample of the alarm on their sites- hard to believe, but maybe some people don't find it as vitally important as I do.\nOther than that, the radio has great sound.  It's easy to use, top quality and has a really nice aesthetic.  I also wanted a white clock as opposed to the typical black or silver.\nVery happy with this purchase!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Sangean RCR-5 Digital could not even turn it on. If I had not ordered from this seller before I would not order from them again. Sent damaged radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: For its size, it also has a truly fine sound quality, not at all tinny or cheap sounding. But the reception is weak for FM stations. I get most, but not all the stations clearly that I desired for preset programming. I use the radio in the bathroom, so I do not need all the other features. I also love the size of this unit. It fits perfectly on the shelf and that is the reason that I bout it."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Lots of good features but I have one problem. I recently had a power outage at 2:00 PM and did not know about it until I returned home that night at 7:00 PM. I manually had the clock re-synch (it was 20 minutes slow)and all was well the next morning. However, this brought up a shortcoming of the product. If I hadn't re-synched it, my assumption is that it re-synchs every day at 3:00 A.M. and I would have been awakened at my normal time (the clock did remember my alarm settings). But this brings us the question - what if the outage occurs after 3:00 AM and lasts for 20 minutes. Will I be awakened 20 minutes later than I wanted? Something to consider when considering this product."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I was on the market for a nice looking alarm that did two things: look good and offer a gradual wake up system. This alarm does both. The aux input is nice but who would listen to music through a clock radio? The speaker is not that wonderful and the radio range is pretty sucky. These are things I don't care about though. All in all, for what it does I think this is way over priced. It should cost 30$ max. Just because it looks better than most alarms, Sangean feels that they can charge 40$. If you have the money and really want the looks then go for it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I purchased this item partly because of its ability to dim the display - which is great.\n\nHowever, I also purchased it for the radio and I can't get any of my normal public radio stations--I don't usually have a hard time receiving stations.\n\nI just can't believe that some of these reviewers say that this thing has great reception!\n\nI live in Boston - so, as another reviewer said - if you live in an area with a lot of stations - you'll have a hard time getting some of the smaller stations. One I get but can hear another station crossed over with it - and others just don't come in.\n\nAnd we don't usually have trouble getting reception where I live...\n\nI am going to return this item."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I love the features of this radio.\nReasonable price for a radio with digital pre-sets.\nNice nap feature.\nHOWEVER...I've had it 3 months and the AM band has stopped receiving stations, all STATIC..very disappointing."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Quote from another review:  \"HOWEVER...I've had it 3 months and the AM band has stopped receiving stations, all STATIC..very disappointing.\"\n\nThe EXACT same thing happened to my radio - buyer beware!!"}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: I own the Sangean portable model 220A and enjoy using it. I could not wait for the RCR 5. I was extremely disappointed. The portable pulled in more AM and FM stations with less interefence. Had to return the radio."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Looks good, reception is OK and sound is pleasant, but controls are illogical and difficult to distinguish - the preset stations look like and are in the same line with the alarm and power buttons. Setting the alarms is complicated and requires re-reference to the manual."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The radio meets my expecttions.  It has good sound and reception.  I expected it to be larger so the size was a plus.  Overall i am satisfied and would recommend it to others"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I bought this because I wanted a clock radio that would have good AM reception.  The reception is average - no better than less expensive clock radios.  The sound quality was very poor.  I have bought the Sangean DT 220V pocket radio which has greater sound and reception, and expected that from this radio so was disappointed."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was looking for a clock radio with a digital radio tuner.  This unit is simple and easy to use.  I like the dimmer feature for the display to save energy and cut down on nightime \"glow\".  There are plenty of preset stations so my husband and I can easily access all or our favorite music."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I got this to replace a 30-year old GE 7-4870 \"Great Awakening\" which finally died after close to 30 years of use. The radio is much smaller obviously and has decent ergonomics. No problem setting the time and alarms, no manual needed. The sound quality is pretty decent, AM reception is usable, though not as sensitive as the old 4870, and is susceptible to overload from strong stations. This seems to be the weakest part, the radio has no selectivity and overloads from strong stations. FM is HORRIBLE if you live in an area blanketed with strong FM stations, which I do just outside of Atlanta. You can try bunching up the little FM wire antenna and this will sometimes make reception better. This radio could not pickup 92.9 Dave FM due to the overload without placing the cord in one position. Even cheap $9 Walkman radios have no trouble- a simple LOCAL\/DX attenuator switch would fix this, what were you thinking Sangean? Otherwise it's a perfect clock radio, I guess it would be if I lived further out. Meanwhile, I'm scouting Ebay for another GE 7-4870, 4880 or 4885..."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am pleased with this attractive clock radio. I wanted a light-colored clock radio, and so many in the stores are black or silver. Because it is not very big, it does not take up a lot of space on my nightstand. Right now, I gave it 4 stars for ease of use, but as I get used to operating the 2 alarm systems, I know it will become second nature to me. I like the Human Wake System. It is nice to have the buzzer alarm slowly increase in volume instead of loudly blasting at the set time. As for the sound quality, I live in a rural area, so no radio has great reception which affects the sound, but it sounds fine, and I can listen to the news as I get dressed in the morning."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF STYLES AND MODELS OF CLOCK RADIOS OUT THERE WITH MIXTURES OF PRICES AND FEATURES GALORE. I WANTED ONE WITH AN EARPLUG JACK TO LISTEN TO NEWS, SPORTS, ETC WITHOUT WAKING THE SPOUSE WHILE SHE SLEPT. THAT ELIMINATED 95% OF ALL MODELS OUT THERE. I DID NOT NEED ATOMIC TIMING, CD PLAYER, iPOD PLAYER, TV OR WEATHER RADIO EITHER. THIS MODEL HAD GOOD REVIEWS ON AMAZON AND WAS REASONABLY PRICED. WENT FOR IT AND GOT A GOOD DEAL! ADJUSTABLE LIGHT, DIGITAL TUNING AND 10 PRESETS, TWO ALARMS AND THE ONE WITH THE PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER CHIRP IS VERY NICE VS. LOUD BUZZERS! GOOD QUALITY FEEL TO THE SET AND CONTROLS. CAME WELL PACKAGED. THE MANUAL IS JUST ADEQUATE FOR SETTING UP THE FIRST TIME. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT ALL THE BUTTONS ON TOP ARE ROUND AND IDENTICAL TO THE TOUCH. JUST THE POWER BUTTON HAS A RED LIGHT TO INDICATE ON\/OFF. TO FEEL IN THE DARK FOR A STATION OR TURN OFF THE ALARM ETC, IS DIFFICULT. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE A GREEN LIGHT UNDER THE STATION PRESETS, A YELLOW LIGHT FOR THE ALARM BUTTONS TO INDICATE ON\/OFF AND WHICH ONE, AND ANOTHER LIGHT, SAY IN BLUE, THAT BY BEING HI\/LOW INDICATES AM\/FM. IF NOT LIGHTS, THEN DIFFERENT SHAPED BUTTONS LIKE SQUARES, TRIANGLES,& RECTANGLES MIGHT BE USED TO FEEL IN THE DARK OF NIGHT TO TURN ON\/OFF, SELECT STATIONS ETC. OVERALL, A VERY GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I read the description of the radio, including the measurements; even so, the radio is smaller than I expected.  I thought I would be able to set everything up without the manual, but after a brief reading of the time and alarm settings, setting it was not difficult.  Setting or changing the alarm will require numerous steps, but is not difficult.  The display is pleasing and easily read from a distance or up close.  It is not the usual green or blue.  The sound is amazing for the size of the radio.  I was a little disappointed at the large size of the electrical cord at the outlet, but considering the sound quality, oh well!  I have heard the alarm or wake up to radio features yet, but that will probably be just fine considering the quality of the radio sound.  I am pleased with the purchase.  It is difficult to find an AM\/FM clock radio without the Ipod.  I also wanted a radio that was easy to change stations.  I would like a remote but that is not to be expected at this price.  I have previously used a Bose Wave radio with remote for my alarm, but its AM reception is not the quality of this radio.  The FM reception is generally the same as the Bose except for my favorite station.  Improving FM reception will require some adjustment of the antennae wire.  This is an amazing little radio with excellent features and sound quality including reception for the price.\n\nI am no longer using the radio.  My cat chewed the thin electrical cord.  Drat.  I did like the radio.  Now am using a Bose Wave Radio ... I guess its sound was better than the Sangean, but a few stations have a little static which is usually solved by moving the radio just a little."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I really like this radio, which fits nicely on my night table.  I use it mainly to listen to talk programs and the quality of the sound is fine for that. I do wish it picked up more stations clearly but the ones I listen to regularly come in well and at night I can pull in ones 500 miles away. Perhaps I'm easy to please as I've always had cheap radios and this one is much better. I like the sleek, low look and have found it easy to memorize which button does what so I can make adjustments in the dark."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Highly recommended.  Agree with all positive reviews.  HWS alarm works with headphones plugged in.  Radio alarm does not over-ride the headphones when plugged in.  I love falling asleep to talk radio on the headphones while my wife sleeps in peace...and I have the peace of mind knowing the HWS alarm will sound in the morning."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Based on reviews by others I had hoped this little radio would satisfy my needs for good AM and FM reception with decent sound.  Sound was tinny but using a set of computer speakers offset that issue.  Reception very spotty for both both AM and FM stations and the little wire antenna didn't help much.  Didn't appear to be any way to boost reception by attaching another antenna.  Since the product didn't live up to expectations, I tried to return it, but was refused.  I didn't retain the plastic bags covering the radio and plug in the box and the box had a couple of tears so the package wasn't in pristine condition.  No damages, scars, etc. to the radio itself so sounds to me like supplier won't accept returns once you open their box which implies a no return policy.  If I had bought this locally at Wal-Mart or Target or about any other store, a return would have been accepted."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was never able to get a really good reception.  I had to keep moving the antenna and the placement.  It was obvious that it would not receive good enough to enjoy.  I returned it, and I must say that it was a very easy return.  I recommend Amazon highly for the ease of returning an item that is not satisfactory."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great, well-made clock radio - external antenna brings in stations even in my valley location.  This radio was an upgrade from a ~10-year-old Sony Dream Machine, and it feels to me like driving a brand new BMW after having had $2000 junker cars all my life.  This radio had just what I was looking for in terms of digital tuning and programmable options, encased in a quality-feeling case.  I like the dimmable display, and keep it on a very low brightness setting.  On the downside, you do need to read the manual to set the alarm.  OK once you get the hang of it, but still complicated. Were I to live in an area with longer power outages, I would like a longer battery backup.\n\nI had never heard of Sangean before.  Based on this experience, I will highly consider Sangean products in the future.  As long as you are OK with the complex alarm settings, this clock radio is definitely worth spending $40 vs. $25-30 for a similar Sony."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This is a terrific clock radio despite a couple of drawbacks for insomniac listening (knocking 1 star off the rating).  Features I require in a clock radio (beyond the obvious) are: earphone jack (my husband isn't interested in listening along with me ;), sleep timer, digital tuning (having to fiddle with station drift would only serve to wake me up more); preset stations (again, the less fiddling in the middle of the night, the better); and dimable display (I keep it just bright enough to read the display at night--this is pretty dim, doesn't disturb sleep).  This radio has all that and more; I also like the small size of the radio and amber light of the display.\n\nThat said, here's what I dislike:  when you press and hold the power-on button to use the sleep timer, the display becomes painfully bright, \"only\" about 15 seconds, but I find it extremely annoying. I'm working on developing a feel for how long to hold the button down without having to look at the display so I can just keep my eyes closed.\n\nThe other thing I dislike: the nap timer button is right next to the power-on\/sleep timer button, making it very easy to accidentally hit the nap timer button without realizing it while feeling around for the power button, thus treating yourself and any sleep partner to the alarm a little while later.  Ugh.  Did that twice, then built a little \"A-frame\" of card stock & taped it over the nap timer button so I don't hit it by accident again.  Note the power\/sleep timer button *is* dimly (nicely) illuminated, so the nap timer button can be avoided if you don't mind opening your eyes, lifting your head up to see the power button, and focusing your attention on hitting nothing but the power button.\n\nIt's too bad the battery backup isn't good for more than a few minutes; hopefully this won't prove to be a significant problem.  I didn't find setting the clock, alarms, or digital presets difficult, though I did need to use the manual to figure it out."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I replaced my $10 GE clock radio with the Sangean RCR-5 because the $10 radio often could not pull in my favorite NPR station in the morning. The Sangean, with the attached arial wire, does that just fine and has a much better quality speaker. However, with its 6 volt LCD time display it is difficult to read the time from across the room, which was never a problem witn the 110 volt LED display on the $10 radio. Turning up the backlight on the display to compensate creates an annoyance at night, unless you want a bright night light. An automatic dimmer would have been nice. I should also add that the unimaginative design with very small buttons is not as functional or as attractive as the $10 GE radio. It also does not provide for an external battery to keep the clock running in the event of an overnight power failure. The interal battery is stated to only accomodate power interuptions of up to ten minutes. But at least the on\/off button is lighted, if you can open your eyes. The bottom line is that I'll keep it for the quality reception and sound, but it should be better designed for its purpose as an alarm clock."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a fabulous product. Well designed and stylish, the sound is fantastic for such a small and inexpensive unit, and it's very simple. I do not find setting the alarms to be at all complicated compared to other clock radios. A joy to own and operate. This was not my first clock radio purchase, but it will definitely be my last for some time. Highly recommended."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Plusses:\n1) Sound quality is pretty good. You won't mistake it for even a set of dedicated mini-speakers, but it's always good enough. (Unlike, say, the mesmerisingly bad&nbsp;.)\n2) It feels like a quality device.\n3) It has an astonishing range of features: nap timers, crazy customizable alarm settings, etc. I enjoy playing with it.\n\nMinuses:\n1) It looks OK. But with slightly different typefaces and plastic finishes, this could be a really classy-looking item.\n2) The UI is cryptic. Way, way too hard to use. I actually had to read the manual. For an alarm clock. Seriously.\n3) The power cord and (separate) antenna come out of the back, but the line-in is on the right side of the unit. Looks sloppy.\n\nSo what you've got here is the engineer's alarm clock: not enough attention paid to aesthetics or usability, but the functionality and build quality are outta sight.\n\nLuckily for me, I'm an engineer."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: \n\n  The Sangean RCR-5 clock radio is very well designed. The feature I like best is the convenient station selection-from among 5 pre-stored stations in each of the 2 bands (AM & FM). This feature may appear obvious, but it was very hard to find a clock\/radio with this capability. It is also very user friendly as far as making the clock and alarm settings. Beside its functionality, its design is attractive-and it is the perfect size (i.e., neither too large nor too small)."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Bought this for my office, not as an alarm clock but for the radio.  Sound is good, not Bose Wave good, but I wasn't looking for that.  Compared to most \"clock radios\" I was impressed.  Buttons make it easy to switch stations and signal strength seems to be about average"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I gave this as a gift for someone who wanted programmed push button stations (like a car radio) which was not easy to find. This radio has good reception and sound quality and the feature of digital tuning that we were looking for. If you don't need the digital tuning it may be more expensive than some comparable radios but we are happy with it"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I have to say that I'm quite impressed by the QUALITY of the Sangean RCR-5 clock radio.  Quite a bit of great detail has already been mentioned in a fine way by a previous reviewer.  I just have to say that I'm really impressed at how clear the radio reception is...absolutely NO drift, it locks onto the radio frequency and stays there!  And the sound from the speaker (even if it is just a single speaker) is rather impressive...I've never heard a speaker sound so clear, crisp, and distinct, whether it be music or spoken word!  I also like how smooth the volume control feels. It keeps great time with an easy-to-view display, and wakes you up comfortably with its \"humane waking system.\"  Some people have noted that the settings for the clock are too complex and complicated, but I frankly didn't experience any problems in that sense.  Of course, it does not have the atomic clock updating, nor does it have a built-in cd player, but it does have the auxillary input, if you wanted to connect a cd player or mp3 player.  Overall, I have to say that certainly alot of thought has gone into the designing of the Sangean RCR-5...this certainly is NO ordinary clock radio...it's a finely-crafted instrument!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I started realizing the quality of this radio as soon as I held the box it came in.  It's well packaged in heavy cardboard throughout.  Take the radio out and look it over; you can tell this is not your everyday clock radio you find in all the stores.  It's built solid and the buttons and controls feel solid.  The sound is much better than any clock radio I've ever owned in this price range.  The display is easy to see from all angles and not too brite.  The amber is soft on your eyes unlike some of the blues and greens out there.  Setting the alarms is slightless less intuitive then it could be but it's easy once you do it a few times (the reason for the 4 out of 5 stars).  Products like this are few and far between these days.  High quality and does what it is made to do very well without looking like an alien aircraft with unessessary bells and whistles.  Very possibly the best engineered clock radio for under $50.  Im very happy with my purchase."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I have nothing but praise for the Sangean RCR-5 clock radio.  Specifically, here are the most noteworthy aspects of this truly amazing product:\n\nDisplay\nHere is where the RCR-5 truly shines, as it incorporates a backlit LCD with adjustable intensity:  one may adjust the backlight to suit your needs, so you have a perfectly legible, yet not too bright display (at night) which can never be \"washed out\", even in direct sunlight.  The display even has a clever feature whereby it will illuminate to full intensity when any of the buttons are pressed, after which it returns to the user's preset intensity after ten seconds. As you can see from the product photos, the display is of a soft, warm color, most conducive to a good sleeping environment; other clock radios using bright blue or green illumination, IMHO, should be avoided if you want to get any sleep.\n\nAuxiliary Input\nVery useful for listening to my podcasts at night; when an external source is attached, the Band button will cycle through AM\/FM\/AU; when none is attached, only AM\/FM are available, thereby eliminating \"clutter\" for those who do not wish to enable this feature.  (Note:  I'm old-school, and prefer using this method over a \"Dockable\" iPod solution, as I prefer to completely run my iPod's battery source to zero before recharging...)\n\nFlexibility in Programming\nOnly found on more expensive clock radios, this model will allow you to use the \"Sleep\" feature to listen to a particular station (or podcast with the Auxiliary  feature) at night, and then to wake to radio on a different station.  In addition, all alarms allow Daily, Mon-Fri, or Single, with the Audible Alarm using a gentle \"ramp-up\" feature.\n\nReception and Speaker Quality\nThe radio's receiver portion of this product is very good, rivaled by only my Sony short wave receiver (a great radio, by the way!); what looks like a 3-inch speaker provides a very warm, intelligible output, very suitable for the spoken word, adequate for music.  If you need a strong system for powerful music, I would suggest purchasing an additional desktop speaker setup (such as for a computer) which can be attached to the headphone output by means of a standard mini-jack connection.\n\nFinally, a no-nonsense Sleep function\nSangean has cleverly incorporated the Sleep function into the Power button (which is gently illuminated when the radio's off); to turn the radio on or off, press the button.  To use the Sleep feature, press and hold the same button to select up to 120 minutes.  Simple, effective, \"it just works\".\n\nFinal Recommendation\nWell, what more can I say?  This product works for me (and I'm purchasing three more for gifts) and has a lot going for it, including high value (very reasonably priced!).  Is there anything that you should be aware of?  Yes:\n\n>  As described in the previous customer's entry, setting the alarm may require a few extra key-strokes, as this product offers many options when it comes to waking by either the alarm or the radio; if you do not need all of these features, you may wish to consider something of simpler means.  That being said, it took me only about 22 seconds to set the alarm; for me, it was relatively intuitive and logical.\n\n>  The built-in battery back up feature only works for about ten minutes worth of backup, according to the manual; in my neck of the woods, this is not a big issue, but should be noted if you experience many nighttime blackouts where you are located.\n\n>  Even though this model is referred to as an \"RCR-5\", it should be noted that it does not employ an automatic time synchronization feature as is found on Sangean's higher end clock radios.  (Not a big issue for me, and may actually be desirable for those of us who prefer to set our clocks 5, 10, or 15 minutes fast to \"keep us on time\"!)\n\nI hope this helps you in making the right decision!  All the best!"}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Settings and use are cumbersome and complicated.  To set alarm and change setting requires multiple combinations of pushing buttons to get to area and then resetting all the way through.  Use of the presets is also NOT user friendly.  As a whole, this unit is not made for someone who may need, even on an occasional basis, to set an alarm to a different time.  I would NOT recommend this alarm clock."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This may be a fine item but didn't have the most elemental item and I needed that --- a plug for ear plugs!!!! I returned it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio exceeded my expectations. The instructions for setting up the time were easy as long as one pays attention to how it's supposed to be done. The screen is so easy to see. The fidelity for a small radio is quite good. This is a little gem of a product."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I was very disappointed with the Sangean RCR-5. I did not get very good reception, but in fairness, I rarely do as I live in the mountains.\nI had thought that buying a better brand might have helped that problem.\nI felt like Rip van Winkle, setting not only the time, but the day, the month AND the year every time there was a power shudder !\nHad I really been asleep that long?  There is NO battery back up.\nWorst of all, I couldn't read the time at all.\nThe face is a brownish\/ beige with blackish numbers, and, not Sangean's fault, but I am color blind in the beige range.\nI might have kept it just as a radio if it had had a back up."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Great radio reception and sound.  The display is one glowing amber light with gray numbers, and is not clearly visible.  The alarms are virtually impossible to deal with, even following the manual instructions.  When you think you have them set, they do not work as you think.  If you set it for a radio alarm, that does not happen; instead a very tiny little chirp alarm occurs.  I may just keep this for the radio, turn down the display or tape over it, and buy a real LED alarm clock to sit beside it!!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I also have the WR-11SE and WR-15WL which are great radios. I bought this one in June 2015 and by mid 2017 the membrane buttons that I used often started getting flaky, meaning they intermittently didn't work and I had to press them several times before the function i wanted worked. It is also very easy to hit the wrong button at the extreme left and right. Button labels are tiny and hard to read. Bright screen, so i usually put a book in front of it to block the light from it. Set up, changing the time, etc., is not very intuitive, but if you do it often enough you get used to it. If you don't change settings often, keep the  manual handy. I mostly listen to an NPR station that is about 60 miles away, which is why I bought this radio. My other Sangeans are the only radios in my house, except for my stereo tuner that can pick it up and I have a honking big antennae on that. I would not buy this radio again. I would look for something"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Radio exactly as described and works perfect for desk or nightstand.  Directions, while easy, need to be read before setting the settings.  First radio I have owned that actually has the year shown, I would much rather have the day of the week but that's a personal feeling.  The amber light is different but actually soothing to the eyes.  The radio reception is good, the sound of the music is what one would expect in a clock radio, the channels are easy to program. I would not hesitate to buy a second one.  Would recommend in a heartbeat!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Good idea but it was too difficult for me to set. I sent it back. It might be fine for someone without my particular physical problem. (Hereditary 'essential' tremors)"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: After about a year of use the Sangean reception for AM radio is totally lacking. The buzzing is so loud as to be unfunctional due to the poor Chinese-made switching power supply. Since the clock radio was purchased mainly to listen to talk radio, it has become almost useless to me."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: love this little white box! i'm so happy i finally found a clock radio with an earphone jack. great fm reception, great quality from sangean."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: The FM reception and sound quality is just fine, BUT as an alarm it is way more trouble than it is worth.  The set-up is unnecessarily complicated and after I shut off the FM radio alarm a tone will continue to sound a seemingly random intervals which, after six months I have been unable to disable."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I've had this radio for about 7 weeks now and find myself thinking I made a good purchase. It's easy to program the alarm. In fact it has two alarms that can be set individually. Two things I especially enjoy are the \"humane\" radio wake up. When the radio turns on from the alarm the volume doesn't blurt out at full volume. It starts faintly and then slowly builds up to the alarm volume I wanted it to be when I originally set the alarm. The second feature I appreciate is that there is an input jack that I can plug a sd card player and use the radio's speaker to hear my own chosen music. Not only that but I can set the sd player to shut off in a certain number of minutes and also set the radio's speaker to set off for 60, 45, 30, or 15 minutes. That's a nice deal. Speaker quality could be a little fuller, with more base, but for versatility its a pretty nice deal. Even the orange face color is adjustable and relaxing to view."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The Sangean RCR-5 is a pretty decent am\/fm clock-radio by today's standards (which are rather low).  LCD display is only OK.  LED would be a lot easier to read. One issue I have is that once you set the alarm for the \"once only\" setting, you cannot cancel it until after the alarm goes off.  Other than that, functionally, it works.  The sound is OK, but not as good as the 35+ year old am\/fm clock radio it is replacing.  However, in its price range the sound beats out everything else currently available."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: It's a bit tricky to setup with its many functions, pay close attention to the manual. The sound is okay but not hi-fi.. I'd buy it again if i had too."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I'm very happy with this clock radio.  The manual is lacking and I needed my mechanical husband to figure out how to use the settings.  I like the 2 alarms.  I use one for weekends and the other for week days.  I turned down the brightness of the clock for night. It's very adjustable, but not so easy to turn the dial underneath it with long fingernails. The AM radio gets great reception. It has a numerical volume control you set for the alarm clocks."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I'd recommend this clock radio if you aren't particular.  The radio picks up signal better than many other radios in my home.\n\nMy major criticism is that you can't really read the black text at night.  If you need an office clock with simple radio, this is a decent choice.  But if you'll have a hard time reading the time in the dark, the back-light kind of ruins it the legibility.\n\nIf you need to read the time in the dark, I'd recommend the Sangean RCR-20 instead.  It's a far superior product."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I bought this in September and for the first 3 months it worked perfectly. But now, the display will not set to the correct day. This means that it awakens me at weekday settings on the weekend, and vice versa. That isn't what I paid for."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This Clock Radio is a mixed bag. The clock radio is well built to the standards of years long past. FM reception is great and the clock radio is packed with features. Where this clock radio fails is on the AM band and I suspect it's due to the noisy switching power supply. There's allot of static on the AM band, so much so it's unusable. I like the radio so will keep it but to get full use out of it I'll need to find an old school linear power supply or build a 6 volt battery box to use the AM band.\n\nUpdate, My suspicions were right, I bought a Jameco Linear power supply to replace the noisy switching power supply included with the radio. It's like night and day, AM reception is now fantastic and you don't have to have the radio more than 5 feet away from power supply. The Radio now preforms as it should. I've upgraded the rating to 3 stars but the radio should operate like this out of the box and it doesn't."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Reception is not as good as I hoped, but it is OK.  It has a real sensitivity to anything nearby and the antenna for AM is adequate, but I bought it for AM and the stations I want to receive come in fuzzy.."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very happy with this radio, enough so that this is our second set  one in a bedroom and one in the kitchen. It has better sensitivity and selectivity compared to older radios we had."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Being radio people we wanted a clock radio that had great reception.  This one does.  It has more bells and whistles than we probably need, but so far, it has worked out very well.  I only have one minor complaint....it is difficult to turn the dimmer button on the bottom of the unit.  Not sure why it was places in such an unhandy location, because I have to dim it each night and make it lighter each morning.  But overall....a really nice radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Works well except it took a little effort to get used to the settings.  I like that u can set the brightness as I don't like a bright clock at night.  Looks nice"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: One awesome clock radio. Front panel light can be set to be as dim or as light as you want, that is hard to find, I like a dim light when I sleep. It has two alarms. Alarm goes off to buzz or to music. You can pre set your radio stations and the alarm loudness. The alarm does have some different modes like Monday through Friday, or seven days a week or just weekends.  I would say this is pretty user friendly. Highly Recommended."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: With no battery back up, this clock has to be reset with every power outage.  That would not be a big deal if setting the date, time, and alarm was easy, but it is definitely NOT!  You have to set the alarm for every day of the week in advance.  We stopped using this for the alarm, and just have it in the bathroom where we can listen but don't need to rely on it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: 4 years later still going strong.  Like the fact that it has 2 alarms and can set for weekdays, weekends or once only.  Easy to set."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This clock radio is small but puts out good sound and locks on to stations to give you great sound. The instructions seem a little confusing at first but after 10 minutes or so you will get the hang of it. The LCD on the front is a power saver but it is a tad too bright in normal viewing. The brightness can be turned down but that also diminishes the black numerals, making it harder to read. Still, a great clock radio at a good price."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I have two Sangean clock radios and love them both, but... when will clock radio makers simplify the setting of alarms? Bought this for one of my boys and he no longer uses it because setting the alarms is too complex for him. He now uses his smart phone as a clock radio. Also, why no self dimming feature? Although I love these radios, they are proving impractical and cumbersome to operate. The smart phones are displacing these in my house. Good quality, outdated technology."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Back-light makes viewing the time at in darkness uncomfortable. Worst part is the human interface...poorly conceived, hard to see icons, buttons are not intuitive and are very annoying when you are half asleep. Sound is not good...you get what you pay for."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I bought it because it is one of the few that have an earphone jack so it doesn't disturb my wife in bed.  It is so difficult to program.  It is difficult to operate on the nightstand at night.  You cannot feel which button does what when you're half asleep in the dark.  All the buttons feel the same and I often hit the wrong button and then a while later an alarm comes on and the only way I can figure to turn it off is to unplug the power plug on the back.  It's a TERRIBLE design.  The only feature that I like is the earphone jack.  Why don't other manufacturers include an earphone jack??  I wouldn't recommend this thing.  It's not thought out by anyone who uses it on their nightstand."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: GREAT sound without being overbearing. I went through a lot of clock radios and then having to deal with their subsequent returns. I should have known better. Sangean is fussy about their radios. Excellent reception and excellent sound. If you love to listen to the radio at night, this radio is for you. I listen to classical after bedtime, then talk after midnight. This radio is perfect for both."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio has some nice features and has good radio reception via the external wire antenna.  Pulls in stations that are all static on other radios.  Happy with my purchase."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Just received this radio.  It sets up just fine if you follow the directions, looks good enough (although the black is glossy which allows for fingerprints to show), and the screen is dimmable, which is the main reason I got this one.  It adjusts with a little knob at the bottom of the radio.  If you get it too dim, it might be hard to read from across the room, but I cared more about it not being as bright as a nightlight.  It looks good.  The problem is that I set up the alarm to go off with the radio (and know I have it set to the speaker symbol rather than the bell symbol), but once it goes off, it switches right away to the alarm bell.  I slept through it this morning, but don't want to make it louder because I don't want an alarm bell.  I can get that with my phone.  I've emailed the seller to see what they say, but if it can't be fixed, it's going back.  Edited to add- The seller wrote back right away, but aren't able to give me a fix.  It'll be going back and I've picked up something else that will hopefully work.  Too bad beasue otherwise, it was a good little clock with a radio that picked up difficult stations."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I wanted a white clock radio - which it is.\nI found the alarm VERY difficult to set and unset. We joke that I should just hit it with a hammer and find a different one."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The product definitely delivered on receiving weak FM stations, which has been fabulous. All of my radios \"drift\" and it gets annoying \"chasing\" your favorite station soooo really appreciate the way the Sangean locks in on the station I want to tune in to. I like, too, that it is small enough to fit on my headboard and I can listen to it with earphones so I don't disturb anyone.  A wise purchase!!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Impossible to get AM band, even when cord is five feet from plug. Was all set to return, but I found no suitable replacement that was as attractive and reasonably priced. So cancelled return and am using as FM only in my kitchen. I guess this is a technology about to become obsolete."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Have had mine for 3 years. It is good for strong local stations, but weaker ones which I can pick up on a cheap pocket radio, don't come in at all. It would be nice if it had a back up battery, as the built in temporary storage lasts 3-4 minutes then you have to totally reprogram it. One nice feature is the earphone jack which is very handy for the bedroom."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a good quality radio. Functions are easy and we'll designed. I would have give it 5 stars, but it needs a few things I would want the manufacturer to do. All functions are great, easy to figure out and we'll designed. The only complaint is as follows\n1. The fm antenna, it is a little wire that is very fragile, and just limp and hangs off the back. I see all the review complaint about this and broken ones.  On mine I taped it all bundled up to the back of unit before it gets broke. The manufacturer \"Sangean\", should have put a telescoping antenna on back that can be tucked away or extended to your need.\n2. The preset radio station buttons are on top of unit. Along with several other buttons for various functions. So it is difficult to discern which one is which ad tiu canmot see them. When your in bed, the face of unit is what you see, and trying to reach over and touch top buttons it's easy to bump other functions and not station pretty sets. They did make the \"power\" button illuminated, which is good,but you only use it once. They should have illuminated all the station pre sets buttons, to aid in changing stations without hitting the other functions. Look at pictures of top of unit. Everything is on top. For me, when I'm laying in bed, my unit on night stand, is level with eye. And I cannot see top of unit. And to reach over and touch top, with all the buttons on top, all the same size, its,easy to hit wrong one. And I end up having to turn on my light ,sit up, and see which ones to use. Other than that, it is a good quality radio. I like it alot. I just like to change stations when commercial's come on, and I wish the radio station pre-sets buttons were illuminated to distinguish them from others."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Works well, and has a nice feature set.  I'd like exactly the same clock with LED instead of LCD readout.  With my nearsidedness, there just isn't enough contrast in the readout for me to see what time it is without getting really close."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very good controls and fine sound for a small radio. Manual could be better. Wish it had a battery back up. Power cord connector in back takes space; would be better if a 90 angle."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: Was going to return, but tried it a little longer and decided to keep it.  Its compact for a bed side table, but buttons a little small for people with fat fingers."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: SEND ME YOUR COMMENTS ON HOW EASY\/DIFFICULT IT IS TO SET THE ALARM ON THIS THING. 1-10 SCALE 10 BEING BEST. FOR ME, IT'S COMPLICATED JOKE. MINE'S GOING BACK."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Not worth the money. Too hard to program date, alarm, and time. The one good thing is the radio has excellent sound. The tuning bar that is supposed to be used to program time and date does not work. I have had this about 2 hours trying to set the time and alarm- it is going back as soon as I pack it back up. I gave it one star because of the sound quality of the radio. The manual is poorly written, and the numbers on the diagrams in the manual are too small to be readable without a magnifyi g glass. Very disappointed in this brand and radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Finally a clock radio I can use bed side! A lot of other clock radios use blue light (which is very harsh and can keep you up at night) and are not dimmable. This radio uses an orange dimmable light! The numbers are big enough to easily see and radio is good quality too. I've not set up the alarms yet but it's nice that you can set separate weekday and weekend alarms (something I will take advantage of). Setup is pretty straight forward, the only thing not super clear in the instructions it that to adjust the sleep timer you need to continue to hold the power button down. I wish I had found this years ago. I would definitely buy this again."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It is hard to see the display on this radio from half way across the room.  A few times I have had to do a factory reset to be able to reset the two alarms."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This is the best sounding clock radio we have had.  It has excellent radio reception and a good speaker.  You can program the alarm to go off Mon-Fri, but not on the weekends, so you can leave the alarm set and on all the time, and it will only go off on weekdays,  It also has adjustable alarm volume, so you can make it louder or softer, as needed.  And a convenient Nap timer, to sound the alarm after 15 min to two hours (you set the time), so you don't have to reset your regular alarm. The control buttons are not labeled very well, and are not intuitive, so you will definitely have to consult the instruction book many times until you figure it out.  But once you do, you will love it."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Unfortunately, I am disappointed with this clock radio. It's not for people with bad eyes. I can't see the time in the middle of the night without my glasses. I have to squint. It shouldn't be that difficult. Sound is good. The reality is that I liked my previous clock radio but it finally died. I use sleep timer a lot but if I want to set it for 30 minutes, I have to open my eyes as it passes thru the other possibilities. Because it is plastic, it is slippery. You need 2 hands sometimes. One just to hold it while turning volume dial with the other."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very good quality; works great. Does everything a clock radio should do very well. Sounds good for what it is (don't expect miracles).\n\nI would prefer it if it were vertically oriented instead of horizontal. It has a large footprint. If it were upright, it would have a much smaller footprint and a forward-firing speaker (the speaker faces upward). Perhaps some people prefer its low-profile design though.\n\nVery happy with it overall."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Similar to many reviews, it's very subjective to what you're looking for. Biggest problems to me are no battery backup, so when power goes out you have to go through several steps to reset it. My 20 year old Sony Dream Machine has backup. Antennae is nothing special. I was hoping to draw more stations on a newer, higher tech radio. But alas, it's not the case. Snooze needs settings. 5 minute snooze is too short. This all said, it's an alarm clock and does that well enough. The music can be set to come on softly and increase in volume; nice touch."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I live in a rural area between Houston and Beaumont in  Texas and usually have difficulty witih some stations, especially in the evening.  I LOVE that with this radio, which is simple to setup, I have GREAT reception of ALL stations at ALL times of the day.  This one is in my bedroom, and I am considering purchasing a second one with battery back up for another room and for disasters. Highly recommend."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: From what I use it, it's fine. I like that it has a plug-in for earbuds so I can listen when I'm going to sleep - I just  set the timer for 60 minutes.  The sound otherwise is not great which I don't care it's not my primary source of radio.  Alarms work fine.  And I like that the light on it brightens when making changes  but dims  within a few seconds.  I live in a high-rise, still can't get a.m. radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: What good is a digital clock radio if 1) The year, date, and time cannot be set via the Tuner button, yet the Tuner button works to reach stations? 2) The secondary digital stations such as 89.1.2 are not accessible? Reaching the secondary stations is why I BOUGHT digital. The radio came out of the box 30 minutes ago and is going right back to Amazon. I'll buy something else."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This a nice compact and functional radio\/alarm clock.  This is the second one I bought for two different rooms.  I like the AC adapter that provides DC input, which reduces noise, especially for AM stations.  The humane alarm that starts soft and gradually builds up does not jar you out of a restful sleep, but wakes you up more gently over a few seconds.  Simple, understated, but well designed.  Well written instruction manual."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Buttons are too small and too close...  Can't stand these snooze and various timed settings and alarm... ONE ALARM that sounds. PERIOD\/  Don't like the low contrast lighted display."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: This radio is hard to figure out, volume does not work, I long for the days of the \"simple and uncomplicated\" - I WOULD NOT recommend this radio"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Exactly what I wanted.  Good clear sound--not boomy and artificial.  It replaced my iHome iBT38 which sounded like it was located at the bottom of a barrel.  I disagree with the many comments regarding the difficulty to adjust settings.  The way to set date, time, year is similar to many home electronic devices:  select, set, select, set...  It's almost intuitive...just read the short manual!  I do wish it had LCD display dimming through an accessible top button instead of a set-screw on the bottom of the unit.  Otherwise, it is exactly as advertised.  Incidentally, this is my third Sanjean radio.  All are great!\n\nOne addendum.  I agree with another purchaser's comment that it is ridiculous that to change the time on the alarm, you have to cycle through all the alarm set up steps..."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Just one problem. I listen in bed and the station selection buttons are in line with other function buttons and it's too easy to turn on alarm or nap buttons when trying to change stations."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Piece of... well *%$#!  This company is advertised as building radios that rival the quality of more expensive manufacturers. While that may be true for one of their products, don't know which if so, this radio is literally worse than my ten dollar portable at locking in weak stations or receiving them at all. We live in the TampaBay area with a bunch of AM stations. AT night all the stations reduce their power but this radio only receives one and that with static, no matter how we turn it or place the extended antenna. In addition, the battery \"back up\" only keeps the settings for 10 minutes if the power goes out and forget about playing it. The radio is garbage in my opinion. DON'T BUY IT."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought 2 of these hoping for good things, and I wasn't disappointed. I own 2 other Sangean radios, and I love them both. Sangean still makes quality radios like some used to make. I appreciate quality in products, and I am happy to write about them.\n\nI was looking for a feature-packed clock radio, and to my disappointment, they really don't exist anymore. I am guessing due to the smartphone. Well, I turn my phone off at night, and like to have a clock radio wake me up. I was looking for a few things:\n\nA quality name\nA typical old-school styled clock radio\nSimple to operate\nAn adjustable display light as to not keep me up at night\nA prominent snooze bar\n\nThis clock impressed me right out of the box. All of the buttons click, as well at the volume dial on the side. The display is LCD with a soft orangish backlight that is fully adjustable with a turn knob on the bottom (the best radios, even in their heyday didn't have this). The sound is full and not tinny like some. It looks like a roughly 3\" speaker, and for what it is,  its not bad at all. The size of the case is just right. If I could find a complaint, it would be the 5 minute snooze time. I must admit, I use it, and I would rather not have it go off so often; I will just have to get up, then. Lastly, you can set each alarm to a station you want, a set volume, and you can set it to M-F, Sat-Sun, All, or only to go off once. There is also a Nap timer that will go to 2 hours if you want it. Nice. There is a 10-minute battery back-up, but don't be fooled, its not a battery. My guess is that it is a capacitor that stores a bit of juice for the clock only. I'm really not bothered by this. Oh, and the tuning bar is a direct-tune bar, or a station-seek bar. Again, the best never had that. They really combined the best of their radios, and a clock.\n\nIf you have looked, I'm sure you've been disappointed, like me. I completely recommend this clock radio. Sangean seems to be an affordable brand, that makes them the way you want them. I don't know how you can go wrong with this one."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I use it a with pillow speaker and the sound is great. Picks up most of my favorite distant stations. Liked it so well ordered another for the other bedroom."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Audio quality is nice. It's easy to set up too. Best feature for me is the dual alarm since I work two different schedules from week to week."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Perfect size for night stand. It is a soft white. Wakeup to nice easy music instead of crazy bell alarm. Good sound system. Price was worth it."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Initially, I loved the radio's quality.  But over time, it has two annoying features.  1. The radio often fades out, and then with a little coaxing, it decides to come back to full volume.  2.  I cannot - and I've invested too much time - figure out the alarm.  I don't use the alarm feature, but this little sucker goes off because I've inadvertently set it, and I cannot CANNOT figure out how to tell it to not go off... ever.  The instructions (on-line) refer to controls that are labelled differently on the device."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Biggest purchase mistake I've made in a long time. Making or changing any setting is so convoluted that, unless you make changes frequently, you'll have to get out the manual every time to figure out how to do it. HUGE negative for me. No clock radio should be this difficult to operate. I bought the radio because it has station pre-set buttons, but everything else about this radio I hate. Would strongly advise against purchase."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I recently ordered this clock radio and gave it about a three week trial.  There are some things I really like about this radio and some things that I really don't like.  I'll share both here.\n\nLIKES\n1. For a radio this inexpensive, the sound was quite good.  Not Bose Wave good (nor nearly as expensive), but still much better than your average cheap desktop or clock radio.\n2. The look is nicely understated, both in the chassis and the muted warm light display.  (I bought the white model.)  It doesn't scream out \"I'm a clock radio\".  So it fits in with a bedroom decor well.\n3. The dual alarm is nice, so you can set a weekday and a weekend alarm without having to change it every few days.\n4. The Humane Wake System, where the radio (or alarm) starts soft and gets louder gradually is a nice alternative to the jarring instant-on of most clock radios.\n\nDISLIKES\n--The human interface is horribly designed--\n1. In addition to the the up\/down bar (which is fine) for numerical settings, there are 11 other small buttons which are virtually identical in size, shape, and feel.  And 9 of them are tightly bunched in one straight row.  They all feel the same, so there is no way of knowing which button you're pushing without memorizing the positions (if you're blind or it's dark) or turning the light on and looking.  And because the on\/off\/snooze button is surrounded by two other identical buttons, it's nearly impossible to find it when the alarm goes off without groping around with your finger touching every button until you come to the correct position for the button you want or turning the light on.  Either way you probably wake up your sleep partner.\n2. Setting a single alarm involves three separate buttons.  And you can't just do a couple touches.  You have to go through a minimum of five button pushes to navigate through all the options, more if you actually want to change one.  And if you're slow (just a couple seconds) on any option, the display kicks back to the non-alarm display mode and you have to start all over.\n3. The sleep option is nice, but you have to choose from the predefined time lengths of 60, 45, 30, 15, etc. minutes.  You can't just specify how many minutes (e.g. 10) that you want.\n\nAlthough I liked the above Likes, the Dislikes (especially #1) were maddening enough that I returned this clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This radio has excellent sound but the numbers are impossible to read at night. I have it in the kitchen, and listen to classical music and the news. Actually I bought another one for my son, whose music choices are more main-stream."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I would have rated it 5 stars except that when dimmed the display becomes close to impossible to read at night and you have to compromise between dark enough to not be distracting to sleep and bright enough to read.  It works fine during the day at pretty much any brightness setting.  A shame because I would have liked to be able to rate it a 5 star product."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very nice small dual alarm clock.  I really like this brand (this is the third item I own).  This has alarm features on it that my last one didn't.  I can set one alarm for Monday through Friday for work and the the other for those single instance days when I need to be up at a certain time.  The speaker is great.  I like the adjustable backlight."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The display is hard to see with my older eyes.  This is not aitomatic or atomic.  In fact very manual and does to have a battery.  I jave had to set this clock 4 times since it arrived"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I just received it and I am almost 64 years old, a female and technically challenged.  I had NO PROBLEM following the directions and it is next to my bed now waiting for my wake up call in the morning.  Seems to have everything on it I wanted and more.  Nice size, not large or bulky.  The tuner is really good and the music comes in very clear.  I did buy the warranty just in case for the small fee.  If I have any challenges after a month or two, I will write again."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I searched far and wide for a basic alarm clock radio that wasn't hideous or stuck in the 80's. This is the only one. Works great."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: a little hard to program all the necessary info for 24 hr vs other time, date and such. I still cannot get the correct date and year to work. I gave up.the instructions were useless. The face light is dimmable but the letters are hard to see if light is dimmed. But sound is nice and so far I have had good reception. I like the design and smooth style."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I needed to replace my bedside clock radio (it was easily 15 years old) and this seemed like a high-quality substitute.  The old one was so easy to set for time and radio station and alarms--especially for daylight saving\/standard time adjustments.  This one is so over-overcomplicated that it beggars description.  I wasted an entire afternoon trying to get the settings sorted out and I finally gave up, went to the Amazon website to get the wherewithal to return it and got it out of the house as fast as possible.  Yikes!!  I ended up in a big-box store where I found a perfectly good replacement for less than half the price of the Sangean.  BTW: Amazon had the refund in my account with incredible speed.  Five stars for THAT!"}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Blew out wall socket.  Poor user info.  Frustrating to set alarm - if you change the setting, have go through a three step process."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is exactly the clock radio I was looking for. It's decent looking in my bedroom and easy to use. I thought the orange backlight would bother me, but I love how you can adjust it. Really good!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: A little confusing to figure out sometimes, but it's exactly what we needed, because my husband can plug his sleep speaker in and I don't have to listen to the radio all night long"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: It's hard to find a good clock radio anymore, but this is one. Clean sound, keeps time well, and two sets of alarms in memory. Minus one star for the display. I would have preferred the numbers be lit on a black background, instead of the other way around as it is now. Even with the brightness turned all the way up, it's hard for me to read the display from my bed (clock is placed across the room from my bed, so I actually have to get up and walk around to turn the alarm off)."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: THE ABSOLUTE WORST!I've had this piece of crap for two years and it is HORRIBLE! Do not purchase one or caveat emptor!  First the on\/off button for the radio quit working and now you can't set the time!  Totally planned obsolescence on the part of a Chinese\/Amazon (synonymous) company."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Most counter-intuitive and unnecessarily super-miniaturiazed and hard-to read controls of any digital alarm I have ever seen. Set-it and pray.\n\nFM Tuner, OK.\nEverything else wins the \"Huh?\" Awards."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: It was OK as far as a clock but could not receive the local stations I wanted which was the reason I wanted a clock radio with easy change of station."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love the dimmable display.  Perfect size for my bedside.  A 5+ would be for the alarm icons to be larger and easier to read."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Works as advertised - manual included and easy to read. Alarm, whether radio or buzzer, ramps up from soft to louder, with maximum volume adjustable when setting the alarm. I would recommend this item to others."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Many clock radios have fm antenna in power cord, those do not work well. This has a separate thin fm wire antenna, works great.  Presets are extremely convenient."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It does everything it is supposed to do. Except for one thing - at night, one can't see the numerals on the yellow-lit display if one is on the same eye level as the display, such as when lying in bed and looking at the clock that sits on a nightstand... You will needto sit up, or to tip the clock, to see what time it is."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: No battery backup--power failure you must go back to square one.  Buttons are all the same so it's difficult to use in the middle of the night. Bought for pillow speaker adapter. Only model available."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I remember when all radios had vacuum tubes and phones had party lines; am an acoustic musician with little technical savvy.  I programmed this radio in a few easy minutes.  Next morning I smiled as it woke me precisely, with superior sound for its compact size.  I appreciate the keen eye for imperfection of previous reviewers, but feel that the nits they picked are swamped by the radio's strengths.  Such thoughtful, successful design.  The manual has been rewritten and improved since some of the reviews below.  Radio looks nice. Once again the ConsumerSearch site proves a reliable source of advice; I have used it for a dozen or 15 years, to supplement Consumer Reports or replace it.  It is a review of reviews like this one and not limited to products its engineers can test."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Good AM reception - functions are straight forward - but the display is not very readable.  So had to keep old large display clock radio for  the clock function."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I don't like it at all. Will sell it for 5.00.  You set it to wake to FM on a certain station and it wakes tuned to another channel with no station and white noise.  Dont buy this one"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Replaced another older clock radio with this unit. It's surprisingly compact in size. Easy to set up, and the best part....it gets awesome FM reception! The old clock radio did not receive the local FM stations well. Lots of static. This one is crystal clear sitting in the same spot as the old one, and I didn't need to unravel the wire antenna! I don't use the alarm feature so I can't review on that. Works very well and I'm happy with the purchase."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The radio was exactly what I was looking for. One of the very few that have an earphone jack. It would, however, be helpful if the product description included the fact it has a headphone jack."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The item appears to be well made and the radio sounds good but do not like the item because adjusting the Display Backlight Adjustment button to a brightness level that is not distracting at night renders the time to a level of not being visible. Because of this we have now moved the Sangean RCR-5 Digital AM\/FM Clock Radio to our fitness room and are looking for a replacement for our bedroom."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very pleased with the reception.  I'm in a difficult area and have gone through two other radios for my kitchen.  I put this on top of the refrigerator and extended the antenna across the top of the refrigerator.  I just listen to talk radio, and want a little noise when I'm in the kitchen.  It worked much better than other radios for this.  I would buy this again."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I really like the design of this radio. But today it didn't wake me up - because it won't change the day of week. I set it for Wednesday, and then it stays on Saturday. Tough on the weekday wakeup. I had another radio by this maker - the taller one with more sound. Also liked the design but it lasted two years before the speaker went crackly. I won't by another radio by this maker."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I like my clock and size.  Disappointed that the time is actually hard to read.\nBackground color does not make numbers stand out.  Also, I thought it would be easier to set, although directions are good."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: When I received this radio two months ago I absolutely loved it! It replaced a 30 year old Panasonic that had finally died. I still love the design and the sound. I find it relatively easy to set and I enjoy having the 5 pre-sets for each band.  BUT....yesterday, it suddenly stopped waking to music and no matter what I did, it only used the beep for the alarm. After re-reading the manual, I did a factory re-set and was able to get the alarm to wake to the selected radio station. The factory re-set is easy. I am hoping that the unit will no fail going forward."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It is pretty good. Awesome interface. did not expect it to know the date. I was disappointed it did t have a 24 hr option format for time. Radio is pretty good, but is similar in signal strength with a wire antenna. Low quiet footprint and profile"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I connected to my Amazon Echo Dot via the AUX port. Nice size with a great display.  The sound is a bit tinny......and is just barely better than the Dot's speaker."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Speaker is small and tinny-sounding, but radio reception is very good, well above average. I used to get static with my other bedside radios, not this one. Always clear."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Nice radio....great sound. I like the fact it has several preset channels available. I like the 2 alarms settings.\nFor me I'm not crazy about the way the alarm has to be set as many days I get up at different times. If I forget to set the alarm to the proper time before going to sleep it seems a major project when I remember in the middle of the night to reset it. Just my problem is all. Other than that ....great radio !"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: As advertised it is small size, big sound. It is smaller than I expected, but small is good. It leaves more\nroom on the nightstand for a book, glass of wine and chocolate. It does lock into stations so much better than what we had. My wife appreciates the earphone jack, as I like to listen to the radio falling asleep. We both like the adjustable dim & brightness of\nthe background light."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Always heard great things about this brand.  The unit was moderately easy to program for needed use. Performance was lacking in AM radio reception.  Built in AM antenna too directional:  Had to literally turn the unit 90 degrees to receive a usable signal, which makes it difficult to read the clock...  Not fun or useful."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: even at dim, the light is too bright at night.  Had a hard time figuring out the alarm  awful reception for am  bought expecting a better radio for my wife extremely disappointed  no better then the radios I was trying to improve on"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: AM tuner less than stellar (and that's what I listen to the most), control buttons are hard to ID by feel in the dark, Alarm programming hard to figure out.  But it was the best for my needs, albeit from a very narrow field.  It has a headphone jack which most clock radios don't have these days."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The read out is hard to see at nite. Am reception is non existent.  The functions and buttons are not user friendly. All considered I'm sorry I purchased this. I took it to my office to use where I can use it for only one channel, not needing the real reason I got this model, earphone jack."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a great alarm clock. I bought a Tivoli Model 3 BT two months before I bought the Sangean. The Sangean as an alarm clock beats the Tivoli hands down. What do you get from the Tivoli at 9 times the price? Better sound. But the Tivoli is a crappy alarm clock. The analog hands are so small it's hard to tell what time it is on the Tivoli. The Tivoli doesn't  have two separate alarms settings or an alarm that starts out soft and wakes you up gently; the Sangean does. I read a lot of positive revues on the Tivoli before my purchase but I soon found out that they were all skewed because some folks think that paying a lot of money means your getting a better product; oh how wrong you can be. On the Sangean my only ding would be some of the settings are a little hard to figure out the first time you set them. But once they're set it works great.  The great reviews are well deserved on the Sangean. If your looking for clock radio that's in the top 10, here you go."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Unlike the RCR-22, Sangean's RCR-5 has a tinny cheap speaker for radio.  I know because I purchased both and compared them side by side.  I wanted the RCR-5 to replace the RCR-22 which I found unusable due to the bright blue light, even on its dimmest setting.  I had read that red light would not disturb sleeping as much.  I'm not sure.  The red light is not dimmable.  Just like the RCR-22, the RCR-5 has an inscrutable operating instruction manual.  My favorites include \"damage the furniture of your radio\".  Also \"the Sleep control begins when you release the Power button\".  Like the RCR-22, the RCR-5 has contextual buttons without clear instruction about what selects the context!  When you first set up the time, you must start with the year and wait no longer than 10 seconds between each piece of information the clock requires, or you will have to restart forrom the beginning.  I just want a simple clock radio with decent speakers and radio presets and red digital numbers.  I can't understand why that is so hard to find!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great Quality - Great Functions - Contrary to a few reviews, easily programmed (IMO) without using the manual, quite intuitive -- An electronic device that may actually be worth the price"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Bought this radio for the sole reason that it has an earphone jack as I like to listen during the night without disturbing my partner. Wish it had an auto shut off like my previous radio...after 60 min on the snooze button it turned off. It came with no instructions at all so I had to wing it. Not terribly user friendly but it serves its purpose."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Sangean has given some thought to the bedside alarm clock in an elegant black case.  Comes with two alarms and you can preset the station and volume you want for your alarms.  The unit will even lower the volume to wake you up with the volume specified in your setting not the last volume you used. The orange backlight can be lowered to the desired brightness or turned off altogether. You can see the time at night without being bothered by unnecessary brightness.  The sound is warm, perfect for news or music.  Only drawback I can find is the linear arrangement of eight buttons might be confusing at night but this can be solved by using some tape or Velcro to make buttons more tactile."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: A Christmas gift.  I use my beside clock radio for one main purpose:  to listen to my local public radio station while I fall asleep or if I awake at night.\nI like several features:  1)  has an earphone jack, so I don't disturb my husband. 2) Power button is lit, so I can easily see it in the dark.  3) Using that power button,  I can set the auto-off for 15, 30, 45 or 60 minutes.  3) i LOVE that the volume level is shown in the display, so if I want to adjust volume as I put in the earphones, I know to turn the dial to \"07\" - no jarring my eardrums.  4)  The alarm, which starts low and increases with volume, can be heard both through the earphones AND externally.  So if the earphones slip out while you are asleep, you still hear the alarm when it goes off - most radios do NOT do this.  5) It is a nice compact radio.\nWhat I don't like:  1) As other reviewers have noted, setting it up and setting alarms, etc. is not intuitive.  Keep that manual handy.  2) I don't care for the amber display - my last radio had a black display with green numbers.  This seems brighter, but not intolerable.  3) Sound is just ok - like I said, I rarely have music on, mostly news and information and that comes through fine with the earphones.  Sound is not as clear if I use without earphones - speaker is on top of radio.\nI've been using it over a month now, and have no problems."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The different alarms\/ or radio are alomost impossible to set and even then you're not sure if it is set correctly as there is nowhere to see what time and station the alarm is set for. I actually bring an iphone and use it as an alarm. On this radio, the digital tuning is great."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: After repeated attempts, I finally got an alarm set. Now I want to change the setting to \"once\" rather than seven days a week and for the life of me can't figure out how that's to be accomplished. What the manual advises and what works turn out to be two entirely different things. When it comes to \"user friendly\", for this user it's been only a headache. Sorry I've missed the return date to send it back--I've now disconnected it and am unfortunately resigned to writing it off as a waste of money."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Wonderful radio! Had lots of frustration with my previous 2 radios have stations drift in and out with volume changing as you moved towards or away from the radio, even weather conditions seemed to have affected signal strength. Started to believe the metal lamp next to the radio and its location in room were the culprits after having two radios in the same spot with same reception problems. This radio sports a trailing external antenna  and hosts none of the previous radio issues. The clarity of speaker is great but also has a port to plug in ear buds for private listening during those wide awake periods during the middle of the night < speaking from experience >!  As a note.. the buttons for operation are \"unlit\" and until you become familiar with placement can be a challenge in the dark."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: A piece of junk! Radio will not work with any object next to it, The digital screen at night is not well defined. The alarm is very difficult to operate and there if no indication of whether what you entered is actually entered. If you want a radio,  buy a radio. If you want an alarm, buy an alarm. The designers of this thing must have been paid by the # of functions they could jam into this box,"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It's a great little user-friendly radio.  It was important to me to find a radio I could use with a mono earbud.  It fits all my requirements for an AM\/FM clock radio.  The only feature I would have liked was to have a battery back-up in case of a power cut."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: sangean radios tend to fail within six months.  have had five portables, keep buying them because i need the product and there are very few choices out there.  this is my first table top, keeping my fingers crossed."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Good sound quality. Easy to program channels to preset buttons.  Dual alarm settings makes it easy to set a normal alarm and a separate one for special circumstances."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Good sound. Strong plastic. Non-potentiometric volume control that won't wear out. Everything about it gives the impression of quality. Humane waking system wakes you without startling (though I wish it were even more gradual). But... The display contrast is not very good. Relative to the LED display on our old clock radio, the Sangean's is hard to see. The indicators for the alarm being armed are inconveniently small. Changing the alarm time setting requires going through many additional steps in order to save the change, even when nothing is changed in those steps."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Used it one day and so far I like it. It was very easy to set up, the sound is more than adequate for a radio alarm (clear at louder volumes as well as low).  Instructions were intuitive and easy to understand.  I am rather pleased with this- it replaces a twenty year old clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This was my second Sangean radio, I will never buy another. The alarm on this one would never stay set as programed and I followed the instructions properly several times including resetting it back to the factory settings and restarting from scratch. It would randomly alarm on the radio station I was last listening to, or might go off on the alarm bell, or it might alarm on the actual radio station I had set it to; but you could never reliably tell. Secondly the only way to turn off an alarm completely was to go back to the factory settings which means you had to reset everything starting from the year, date, time, etc. You could not just hit a button and turn off the alarm permanently, the best you could do was set the alarm to go off once but then it would go off one more time and if you needed to shut the alarm off without it going off never again you were simply out of luck. Maybe I just got a bad one but again this was the second bad Sangean radio I've gotten, that first one costing $170. and also with unsolvable bugs."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is the fourth Sangean radio I have purchased over the years. I first encountered Sangean back in the 1980s when I was shopping for a decent portable shortwave radio. That radio, an SG-792, is still going strong more than 30 years later. The second was a Realistic DX-440, a rebadged Sangean ATS-803A -- a $200, full-blown PLL-synthesized AM\/FM\/SSB shortwave receiver that served me well for more than a decade until I sold it to a friend back in the '90s -- a decision I've been regretting, and I'm currently eyeing the used ones on the auction sites. My third Sangean is an RCR-2 \"atomic\" clock radio that I found on a shelf at a Goodwill store a few years ago; it's still going strong and keeping split-second time.\n\nAs for this one, I seem to have a thing for discovering Sangeans at thrift stores, because I stumbled across this RCR-5 (white), new in the box, at a thrift store about a month ago. (I paid ten bucks for it, nyah nyah.) Since this was an impulse purchase for no other reason than I love Sangean products, there was no comparison shopping or reason to nitpick here. Being an amateur radio operator for the past three decades, I came home and put this little baby to the test -- and I have not been disappointed. Sangean's hallmark is excellent sensitivity and selectivity for a portable consumer radio. Here in my home office in the Richmond, Virginia area, I found myself listening -- for quite a while -- to the Grand Ole Opry on WSM in Nashville one recent evening, then moving over to WLS (Chicago) and WCBS (NYC) for a while. It's a very nice bedside radio for the broadcast band DX'er, as they call those of us who find satisfaction in \"pulling out the weak ones.\" Easy to tune -- I *hate* radios that \"take off on scan\" when you press the tuning buttons. This one allows you to tune around without it thinking, \"You couldn't possibly want to stop *there*!!! ... and taking off up the dial. (I have an old Panasonic that's a great radio but tries to outsmart you by skipping over weak stations, and that annoys me. *I* am the master of my tuning control!)\n\nI haven't played with the alarms yet, but since they're identical to the ones in my RCR-2 (i.e. Humane Wake System and dual alarms settable by week\/weekend etc.), I can say that they're easy to understand once you've set them a few times. Regarding display brightness, there's a brightness control underneath the radio that allows you to control the brightness from impossibly dark to nightlight-bright. If you have it set for anything less than full-bright, the display will \"wake up\" to full brightness when you press a button and then revert back to your setting after a few seconds. There are also a couple of \"hidden\" features (well, hidden only to purchasers who don't read the instructions for products they purchase, which is dumb): The display can be changed from 12- to 24-hour format, and you can also change the way it displays the date when you press the Time Set \/ Display button.\n\nI must make one comment in response to all the reviews about the capacitive 10-minute, non-battery backup feature ... about a week ago, a transformer blew a circuit breaker in my neighborhood and my power was out for about an hour. Once the power came back on, I walked into the office prepared to reprogram the Sangean, only to discover that all of its settings were still intact. So my guess is, they stated 10 minutes to \"CYA\" -- but YMMV. Mine certainly did.\n\nSangean has a reputation for quality componentry, and the buttons and knobs on the radio are all quite tactile. In fact, the volume control feels downright high-end -- very smooth and fluid-feeling. And it's rubberized, making it easy to locate by feel and adjust with clumsy, half-asleep fingers. Audio? Typical Sangean high quality. I read somewhere that Sangean doesn't believe in selling a radio with substandard audio -- and while this little guy might be fairly entry-level, they didn't forsake their trademark sound quality. And they place quality speakers in their radios that are designed to handle the audio output with little to no distortion, even at high volume levels. Another fine little Sangean product to add to my collection!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: If you are looking for an AM radio this is a great one! The reception is excellent. I've had been looking for quite some time for a great AM radio. I like to wake to the news in the morning and finally found one!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I like this radio.  Unfortunately, it has one flaw which makes it useless to me.  I listen through headphones, and when I set the volume control to its maximum setting, the sound is still way too soft.  I will be returning this radio, as this flaw is fatal for my needs."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: descent radio\nmy unit had a universal power adapter input: 110\/220 V 60\/50 Hz.\nSo to convert to Europe power outlet you need only simple plug adapter."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Overall this is an excellent radio for my use.  I use the headphone jack, the sleep and nap features and love the preset stations.  The speaker is OK but not fantastic.  Sound through headphones is very good and headphones allow me to listen at night without disturbing my husband. An improvement I would make is to make it easier to distinguish among the button in the long row on top.  I put a small bit of thick tape to mark the first and last of the 5 pre-sets so, in the dark, I can feel where I am on this row.  I can imagine a few well placed bumps on the case to indicate to the location of key buttons."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This is an excellent clock radio.  The A\/B alarm settings are especially nice.  That allows you to have one permanent setting for your work week that you can turn off when necessary and use \"Alarm 2\" for a one-off or secondary setting for vacation and off days.  When it's time to go back to work on your regular schedule, you simply reactivate \"Alarm 1\" without having to go through all the setting.  My only complaint (wish really) is that the \"nap\" setting also had the option to activate the radio as the regular alarm does.  Instead it only sets off a horribly annoying beeping which is not at all pleasant to wake up to."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Very inferior product.  It is a light-weight plastic box with instructions that do not produce any results. I'm so frustrated with spending so much time to place the correct time with only an A.M. logo showing, and wasting time to get the alarm to work.  So disappointed."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This is my second Sagean. Distant stations are received with clarity. This is important for commuting weather and traffic. Sound is good, but not the best for music. This is our \"go to\" device for morning newscasts and getting ready to commute into the city. Hang on to the instructions. Set-up is not intuitive."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Decent sound, for a small speaker, but better than most other clock radios I've heard. Good functionality.\n\nOne problem I found; the wake up settings can include which channel to play, which is a nice feature. Except, if I go to sleep listening to a different channel, the wake-up alarm sounds instead of the chosen channel playing. If I want to hear channel-1 upon awakening, I can't go to sleep listening to channel-2.\n\nOther than that, I'm happy with this item."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was just looking for a simple radio for the kitchen to keep my dog company when I wasn't home.  I like the digital tuning aspect so that I now don't have to deal with periodic static when I walk around.  This tunes in perfectly,is easy to turn on and off and has a nice clear sound.  I like the digital illuminated clock so I can check the time without have to squint at the stove clock.  I'm sure my dog likes it as well but would much rather I stay home with him.\nNice product."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Bought this for my wife who needed a digital radio\/alarm clock to replace her cheap analog version.  This clock radio works great.  It get decent AM reception, way better than the old unit.  The feature that causes the alarm or radio to start softly and then build to full volume is wonderful.  My wife loves that feature.  She has learned how to program the alarm setting without a whole lot of trouble.  Finally we love the ability to adjust the brightness\/dimness of the display for day time or night time. All in all, we are very pleased with the Sangean Clock Radio"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Like everything made in China the instructions are so small you can't read nor make out the labels.  I am just getting ready to see if I can find an online instruction manual and parts labels big enough to read.  I sometimes think that Chinese manufactured items instructions are produced so unreadable just to punish non-communist world."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Works great, very dimmable, good radio reception (love that it has presets).\n\nOne weird thing is it counts seconds along with the time. Not ecessarily something you want in a clock next to your bed\n\nThe face tips down a bit, nice to keep room illumination down but my nightstand is low so i keep a book under it"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I love this radio.  Once you understand how to set the alarms, resetting them becomes quite simple.  This radio is very dependable and does its job very well.  The one thing that my wife and I like about the alarm (both radio alarm and beeping alarm), is the fact that when the alarm goes off it starts off at a very low volume and gradually gets louder until it reaches the volume level that you set.  I would highly recommend this alarm to anyone."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a perfectly usable clock radio. It was easy to program after reading the instructions. The sound quality is good. I like the compact size. The more advanced models seemed to have a lot more problems according to the reviews, so this is great for getting me up in the morning, really all I need. However, like another reviewer of this radio, I HATE watching the seconds displayed. Why would anyone need to see time in seconds? I wake up and look at it and feel like an insomniac."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The Sangean RCR-5 Digital AM\/FM Clock Radio is very good clock radio that lacks the advanced features of some newer clock radios, but what it does, it does well. The display is very easy to see, and the brightness can be adjusted from very bright, to all the way off. It's easy to set. The radio works well. It has good reception on both bands, and sound quality is about what you'd expect from a small mono speaker radio. There is a headphone jack and auxiliary input too. It does exactly what I bought it for, and I'm happy with it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: if you are over 40 and need reading glasses you will need to put them on in the morning to see the numbers .sangean makes a great radio I own several but the display on this is not for me I will end up putting this in the bathroom"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Nice build quality, just the right amount of functions & are easy to use. Instead of brightly lit numbers, they are black with an adjustable mellow lit background. FM stations come in easily thanks to the external wire antenna; 4 AM stations come in ok, which is typical for where I live. I would recommend."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I purchased this radio to use at my desk at the office.  I love the look, the digital stations that can be preset and the headphone plug.  This radio fit my need perfectly!  And there is another aux plug for my iPod too!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: A nice size clock radio.  It was a little hard to set up the stations, but we finally figured it out.  I purchased this radio for the kitchen.  The time is a little hard to see from a distance.  The sound is good.  We are able to receive most of our FM stations, but do have some static on the AM side. Not a bad radio for the price."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I like this radio a lot. Between the solid tuning, the preset buttons and pretty decent sound for the size, there's a lot to like. However, the way the sleep timer is set up is idiotic. I use the sleep timer a lot, and while this is not a deal breaker, it does make it lose a star for me.\n\nReview updated to note that I am having the same problem now that some previous customers mentioned. The power button, which is also the sleep timer button, is no longer working properly. It can take several presses and wiggles of the button to turn the radio on or off, and the sleep timer (which requires the button to be pressed and held) hardly ever works any more. This is ridiculous. I can no longer use the sleep timer, due to the concern that the power button will fail completely. I'm sending a message to the seller, but I don't have much hope for a positive resolution. If there is a replacement, I will update this review again.\n\nThe seller referred me to Sangean. Sangean did not respond to several emails\/contacts via their website. I called the phone number also given by the seller, which surprisingly connected me to a person at Sangean. The ripoff is that they want you to ship the radio to them, and send them a check for $8 to send it back to you. Between all of those shipping charges, that's half the cost of the radio. I am starting to think that I may be better off not sinking more money into a radio that has major design flaws."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is the best clock radio I ever owned. The sound and radio reception, both AM and FM, are excellent.\nProblem with these type of Alarm clock Radios, are the instructions. They are difficult to understand, as each button used in setting up and making changes to the settings have to follow a proper sequence, pressing once or holding for 2 seconds. The display panel can be of great help, but image of it included in the instructions, need improvement. The instructions could also be written in a simpler manner.\nI must complement Sangean's customer\/technical service representative who was very knowledgeable answering the questions I had.\nHighly recommended.\nAdded 12\/25\/16 Best feature of the clock is the progressive increase in the volume of the radio as it sounds in alarm mode. You never get jarred out of your sleep."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The radio has a good sound, and the preset station buttons are great because I listen to three different stations at different times of the day."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is the BEST clock radio I have ever owned and I have had quite a few.  The sound is excellent, programming is easy, nice and compact.  I love it!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The clock radio is fine, the speaker tones are great and that is what I wanted.  The only issue is that the lettering for the clock is hard to read because they are not very pronounced."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: As advertised, and works great...with two exceptions.....Snooze alarm is set at a fixed 5-min interval...Really? That's not a 'snooze'....that's a 'blink'...\nAnd, it seems to be stuck on February....no matter what I change, it's February.....What this means is that I need to set both alarms the same, or, during the week, I wake up late, or vice versa, as it's always got the wrong day of the week showing.....\nMinor inconvenience, and other than that, I like it....decent value...."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: My very old Sony dream clock radio died and I spent a ridiculous amount of time attempting to find a replacement.  I read so many reviews from various websites and decided on this Sangean.  I wanted good reception, preset stations, dual alarms - this has all that.  I live in a rural area, can't sleep at night and rely on the radio as my distraction.  I can pull in major stations 150 to 200 miles away at night sometimes farther.  I read a review about the difficulty in using this - I don't it much different than my 15 year old Sony or even programming the answering machine.  One uses the same button for multiple things however I don't find this any more difficult than anything made today that does more than one function.  I did not buy it from Amazon because I wanted to be able to return it easily if the reception was poor so picked it up for close to the same price at a dreaded large retailer.  I'm sure I could have spent over $100 on a new radio but after reading so many reviews it didn't seem that I would improve much on this affordable alternative.  I would recommend this and at the price it's a pretty good deal."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The speaker on this is just terrible and sound comes with constant static. All stations sound bad and we live in an area with fine FM radio reception.  Even the aux connection sounds muffled.  I wish we tested this before the return date.  Will simply have to throw it away."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It does what a radio should do, holding the station without drifting and producing okay sound. The buttons on the top are tiny and the procedures for setting the time or an alarm are absolutely confusing.  I have it in the kitchen where I use the clock and listen to one station, and it works fine for that limited purpose."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I got a defective one. When I set the alarm to go off on radio, sometimes it goes off on the beep. Very annoying. The first time it happened I double checked that I had it set to radio properly, and I had. Then it happened again 2 other times in the same week. I'm returning this.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because other than the problem of not being able to wake up to the radio (which is why I got this in the first place), I rather like this alarm clock. I'd normally give it 3 or 4 stars if it worked properly. The sound is ok but not nearly as great as everyone in the reviews are saying, and the feature to have it go off on certain days of the week is really neat. It feels cheaper than what it should for the price though, it is light and made of shiny plastic that feels cheap. I was disappointed when I opened the box and saw this, I expected better for build quality.\n\nAll in all a nice alarm if it were half the price and weren't defective."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Fantastic.  Catches a radio signal very well, which is hard at our house.  I like that it can dial up the stations by half increments if you choose.  Love all the features especially the crescendo alarm.  If I'm listening to the radio as I lay in bed, the alarm still goes off, but softly, then gets louder to wake me up.  I also like that it doesn't jar me awake.  Only thing it's missing is a snooze bar, but maybe that's a good thing!  You need the instruction manual for the first day to catch all the features, but it will be intuitive after that.  Also really like the disable display that doesn't keep me awake."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Good sound. Looks solidly built. My only gripe is turning on or off the alarm. As other reviewers have commented, Sangean definitely over engineered that aspect. It could have definitely been more simplied. After all, sometimes it's about the keystrokes."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I needed to replace my 30 year old Proton 320, and Sangean was highly recommended.  The unit is small but mighty.  I had a question about the alarm programming and wrote to the supplier, but they were completely unable to help.  I called Sangean and got immediate assistance."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I'm very happy with the radio.  I bought it to replace a Boston Acoustics Receptor radio which was losing its FM capability.  The sound quality of this radio is excellent, especially considering its size.  I really appreciate the humane alarm feature.  The only downside for me is the radio's small size. I have some difficulty in reading the alarm symbols. I didn't have any problem figuring out the instructions like some others.  The instructions are a little complex, but the radio has a lot of features in a small package.  Overall, a very good buy."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: THIS IS A WONDERFUL ALARM CLOCK RADIO! EVERYTHING THAT SANGEAN ADVERTISED IS TRUE. ONLY THING IS THAT THE SOUND QUALITY IS JUST OK TO ME. HENCE, 4-STAR RATING."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Second one I bought.  Have one in the bathroom for morning prep and one in my workshop for \"company\" while I'm working.  Able to play all my iPhone songs through this speaker with \"Aux In\" connection and get my favorite local am\/fm stations."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: Returned this product immediately. Couldn't see the display at night. The radio which was set for 7:10 am didn't come on. The present stations didn't work properly."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: Worked great for two months and then radio started humming and lost all AM and FM stations for hours. After a while it worked again but problem recurs every night.  The warranty requires me to send the radio back ($12 USPS) and enclose a check for $8 for their shipping.  Seems like within a year they should pay for all shipping.  As a result I won't be buying any more Sangean products."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Complicated and irritating.  If you want the alarm on Monday to Saturday, and off on a Sunday....I see no option.  Without a major production.  It's just a real hassle in general.  Also, there is some weird humming noise that comes & goes.  the light also comes & goes if I am holding it to set it and sometimes this \"E\" comes up.  so I don't know what's going on here, but I followed all the directions. It's very nice looking & the sound from the radio is outstanding, BUT it's just too much work & it is not user friendly.  I'll probably return this."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio is perfect.  I wanted a small table radio that I could us in the living room.  I wanted one that had buttons on it for switching stations, not the knob that makes it difficult to search for programs.  This one fit the bill.  I had ordered and returned 2 others but this is a keeper.  The sound quality is pretty good for such a small radio."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I've heard a lot of good things about Sangean audio. I ordered this one since it looked like a nice simple alarm clock radio with decent sound for a small box. It was a bit complicated to program the alarms and all but the big problem was the radio alarm would not play when set up for radio. I'm pretty tech savvy and I know I was doing it right. It was a glitch and, searching the reviews here, it seems to be pretty common.\nThat's too bad because Sangean won't be in this household for a very long time."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Really like the features. I like the sleep timer for the radio. Has jack for headsets. 5 stations for radio presets for each AM and FM channels.\nReception on radio stations came in really good."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: In 1993 I bought my last decent clock radio.  It didn't seem like anything special until it finally died last year and I went to replace it.  What a sea of obtuse junk I had to wade through!  Non intuitive button layout is the new normal. Digital tuning is now surprisingly rare when it seemed standard 20 years ago. What a leap backwards.\n\nI never heard of Sangean until Amazon searching brought me to several products including the RCR-5.  Now I've had it for almost a year.  It reminds me of my 1993 Sony but brought into the modern era, which is what I hoped for all along. (The sound, though, is more than a little improved.)\n\nI like it.  I'd buy it again. With luck, I won't have to revisit the decision until the 2030s.\n\nThere are a few fiddly things related to time and alarm setting they could make simpler.  Beyond that I have no complaints."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Works well but. Overlooked that it can't be set for 6 days Eg Mon-Sat or select days individually days that can be can be repeated. The Sony it's replacing you could choose any combination of days Eg Mon,Wed,Fri & Sat. Or Mon, Tue, Wed, Thurs, Sun.  As you can do with a cell phone."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is at least the 6th clock radio I've ordered from Amazon.  I'm sorry to say this but they're all garbage.  I thought if I spent a little more on this Sangean I might luck out.  Wrong.  The setup is a joke.  There are about six steps involved.  Believe it or not, you have to go through all the steps with no hesitation; you can't take too much time at any of the steps or you lose all the previous settings and have to start over again.  At the stage for \"frequency\" (you can set the alarm for a certain day) pressing the +\/- bar does nothing.  You have to go through all this just to set the AM.  What is it with these manufacturers?  All the reviews for clock radios of every company complain about the same things.  You can't do a setup.  If you do a setup it doesn't hold and loses minutes (often right out of the box).  There are too many buttons.  The buttons are too small with script that's also so small you can't even read them.  If anyone out there is listening, these things are not the Mars Rover or IBM's Watson; they're CLOCK RADIOS!  There's a reason the old Sony Dream Machines (now discontinued) are on sale by some retailers for over $100.  They do what they're supposed to do.  Easy setup, accessible interface and decent sound quality.  How about a simple switch to change from AM to FM?  God save us from smart machines that outsmart themselves and make fools out of customers.  (I gave this unit two stars because the sound quality was above average)."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this as a replacement for a replacement of my old Sony Dream Machine Cube that I owned for 20+ years. It was sturdy, ergonomic, and it had a wonderful radio unit. The first replacement I bought was what now passes as a Sony cube (~$20 Amazon), made in China, which is a complete piece of garbage. Ignore the positive reviews as they have been written by people who never saw a real Sony in their life. It truly stinks: cheap plastic, sharp edges, shoddy construction, crappy radio receiver, etc. I must have been mad to think that anything of the old Sony quality was available at a similar price.\n\nActually the old Sony Cube design now sells upwards of $100 bucks. I night have sprung for it, but I wanted to check the competition first and see if I could save some dough. $100 for a clock-radio is nuts.\n\nThe Sangean turned out to provide excellent value for the money.($35 at the time of this writing.) The manufacturing is great---sturdy, tight chassis,  excellent receiver, golden light with adjustable brightness, AM-FM with Seek or pre-sets, auxiliary and headphone jacks, nap timer, easy-to-read numbers, two alarms...\n\nThe radio sound doesn't have that low-end tinny clock-radio sound. Reminds me of the table radio I had in high-school. Not content to leave well enough alone, the government has made some new AM regulations that affect the Am band sound, but the attached antenna does a great job of hiding them. (You might have reception problems way out in the boonies; otherwise it should be fine.)\n\nThe curved edges make it comfortable to cuddle up to in bed, which is one thing I alway enjoyed about the Sony. I hate using headphones when I'm going to sleep."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Its a good enough clock radio, it has the headphone jack I needed, but the LCD dis0play is too small and not bright enough for me to se with my impaired vision."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Best clock radio I've ever had. Multiple alarms are great. No need to turn alarm off for the weekend, just set m-f once and never messed with it again. Radio sounds good, starts off low  then volume goes up."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am VERY happy with this alarm clock radio!  Overall the size is just right: small enough to fit on my nightstand, large enough to accommodate the display and necessary buttons.  The orange-ish backlight is easy on the eyes at night, and easy to see during the day.  It features digital tuning, and you can pre-set 5 different radio stations.  I found it very easy to program the alarms: sure it requires pressing the appropriate button multiple times, but lots of electronics make you do that.  One of the nice things about the alarms (you can set two different alarm times) is that you can schedule the alarm to go off only once, only Monday-Friday, or only on the weekend.  And I really love the \"humane waking\" feature, where the alarm comes on softly at first and then gradually increases to your preset volume, so you don't get blasted out of bed.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend, and would definitely buy this item again."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Nice clock radio, small, fits on nightstand well.  I don't like the interference on the am band.  This was discussed in the manual and if I had known it I wouldn't have purchased it as I like to listen to AM.  Lou"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent small\/normal size clock radio.  The sound is remarkable for the unit's size and the digits of the time display are about 5\/8\" high which I can see without my eyeglasses at night.  I like that this unit knows the date so my alarm can be set for Monday-Friday and not weekends.  I'd heard about Sangean before, but now I own one and can say that all the info about their superior radio\/speaker is true.  This unit replaced one double the width, depth and height and yet it sounds better!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Still haven't got the hang of setting the alarms.  Also can't figure out how to set the sleep timer for the radio.  Maybe it's just me, but even after following the instructions, I'm not where I should be!  Maybe I should have bought a clock radio with less bells & whistles.  Radio reception is excellent."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Only a couple niggling problems - it's too easy to set \"nap\" when I'm trying to hit something else, and even on the dimmest setting it could bother your sleep if you like sleeping in a very, very dark room."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Kind of small, but otherwise works well.  One weird thing is that knob for adjustment of illumination is on bottom, so can't change it easily from lights out to daylight."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is the best alarm clock I've owned.  I bought this one because of its digital tuner and sound quality (I use it as a radio too).  The buttons are solid and the sound quality actually is good.  The volume is digitally controlled which is nice, no more accidentally turning the wrong one and waking up to static.  The presets are very easy to set and use, I've never owned a clock with this feature and I probably won't own one without it again.  There is an aux-in as well (3.5mm), I never really use those though so I haven't tested it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Needed a new alarm clock because my 25+ year old one only got one radio station and I didn't always want to listen to that station's morning show when I woke up. Decided the new radio had to have a digital tuner and multiple alarms. This clock fits the bill. Takes a little while to set the alarm timer, but its not difficult - you are setting more than just time, you're also setting day and radio station. Being able to set different stations to different alarms is a nice feature. You can also set it to just turn on the radio without the alarm (which sounds like a truck backing up). Now my only problem is that I have found out that early morning radio in my town sucks and I'm still waking to the same station. :-)"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Overall I'm happy with this clock radio. The sound quality is quite good for this little box and I love the gradual volume increase. Features I would improve upon are a more intuitive design for setting the alarm, and an easier or automatic adjustment of the brightness of the readout. I have it set very dim for nighttime, but that means I can barely read it during the day."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: (1) Be forewarned. An insert in the box -- which is not in Amazon's description -- says \"VERY IMPORTANT PLEASE READ. Sangean suggests that you keep the AC Adapter at least 12 inches away from the radio while listening to the AM band. Your Sangean radio is powered by an AC adapter which is a 'switching' or 'switch-mode' type. The DOE (Dept of Energy) has a Federal mandate requiring all manufactures to use this type of power supply. This newer power saving technology has the unfortunate side effect of causing interference to the AM radio band.\" As it turns out, I need the adapter to be within 12\" of the radio. Amazon should include this in the item's description.\n[...]\n\n(2) I don't know if it is because of where I live (suburb) or the radio itself, but the reception I got on both AM and FM was poor. Only a couple stations came in strongly. Therefore, I cannot rate this radio more than two stars ** (below average).\n\nSo, for both reasons, the same day I received the radio, I am returning it to Amazon for full refund. My verdict: Thumbs down -- this radio is not a keeper."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: most features are as expected but the AM reception doesn't measure up to my other radios of similar quality.  Like the headphone jack so my wife can listen to music while I snore (my bruised ribs are starting to heal)."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am so disappointed with this clock radio. It had the potential to be fantastic. But, it doesn't have a battery backup. So, every time the electricity goes out (which happens at an alarming rate at my house) I have to not only re-set the time but all the memory pre-sets as well! So, I'm giving it away. The radio gets pretty good reception. But it's just not worth the hassle of no battery backup."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Gets better reception than old one. Missing daily used function of sleep mode, where radio would go off at set time. Simple function that should be included."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: After living with it's eccentricities for 60 days, I've grown to hate it. It just is so badly designed. Grrr. My earlier review is below, but the difficulty of programming the alarm, the difficulty of turn it on and off for just one day, and the need to constantly reprogram it (as opposed to leaving one time in place, but turning on that time only when I need the alarm have made me hate it.\n\nHere is my earlier review:\n\nIt's a good radio with three oddities that really knock it down from from being a five star product.\n\nFirst a clock radio, especially an expensive one like that one that doesn't come with a battery backup in 2016 is an embarrassment. This has a 10-minute backup, which is ridiculous.\n\nThen the user manual isn't written well and the icons, especially the ones identifying the buttons are in such tiny type they are nearly unreadable.\n\nBut the real oddity is the way the alarm gets set.\n\nSetting the alarm is really easy if you want to set it for a regular schedule. It can be set to go off every day, or weekdays only, or weekends only.\n\nBut it's very odd if you want to just use the alarm occasionally or skip a day.\n\nIf you do that, the clock radio doesn't retain the last alarm time. It defaults to 6 a.m. and you constantly have to reset the alarm.\n\nSo if you have a day off or a holiday and turn off the alarm, you have to totally reset the alarm the next time you use it. It's not a good design for any alarm clock. It's especially bad for an alarm clock with two alarms. If you set one alarm for music wakeup and another for a buzzer wakeup, they both have to be reset each time.\n\nAt least that is what the instructions say. It's not very clear.\n\nIt's not very user friendly. ."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I live in the country that has poor poor reception. I thought I would be able to get reception in there from the reviews I read. Still can't get good reception. Took it to my job and it worked intermittently. Got so disgusted, gave it away."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Nice size.  A little tricky to set, but it helps to read the instructions.  lol.  My only true complaint is that the On\/Off button is in the second row.  I would have put it in front, as the most accessible spot.  It is lighted, though that doesn't help when I'm just \"feeling\" for the button.\nSound is good.  Plugging my phone in the same outlet does not affect the sound, as in my last clock.radio."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Cannot figure out how to set the alarms.  Read the instructions; too hard to work the buttons; is this made in China?\nThe back lite is too bright to be able to read the time from an real distance.  I regret buying this product.  I want one that was digital music dial and that is what led me to this choice."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was hesitant to buy a new clock since I'd had my current one for 30 years.  I ended up needing a dual alarm with a short snooze (this one is set at 5 min which is what I wanted).  I'm getting used to the backlit display  -  great graduated control over brightness so you can make it nearly off.  It was easy to set up and easy to use."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is just an average radio alarm clock. The radio reception is the same as any average radio, meaning that high output stations come in great but small or moderate output stations are plagued with static. I'm now thinking a WiFi radio would be a better choice.\n  The alarm feature is complicated and the settings are too small in size. The dial background is light yellow with black numerals, it's hard to read in comparison to my Sony with big red numerals. If you need reading glasses don't  buy this unit, you have to use them to read the alarm settings. On a positive note the presets are nice"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Crystal clear reception, even for some far-away stations, and nice sound quality.\n\nThe options for alarms (e.g. weekday only, choose station and volume) are fantastic."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great little clock radio. fairly easy to programme etc and good sound.\nMy last radio had a remote which was very handy, this would be perfect if this could be  added."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The clock would not keep time. It was nearly eight seconds fast per minute. I sat there with a stopwatch and it took 52 seconds for the minute to change on the display. After about an hour it would be about 15 minutes fast. What good is a clock radio if the clock doesn't work?"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Like: Nice size, good sound. Attractive design; not too many tiny buttons. Two alarms can be set.\nDon't like: Sleep timer is maximum 60 minutes. Display is not dimmable and is fairly bright at night. Buttons should be backlit. Manual appears to be written with Google Translate."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I like all of the features. Nice orange color LCD. Adjustable brightness. Has a gentle wake option (music starts at low volume and then increases gradually).\nI do not like the buttons. They are all the same shape and size (except for snooze). I contrast this with my old Sony which had different shaped buttons for each function. With the Sony, I could do what I needed to do just by touch. With the Sangean, I need to create a mental map of the layout so there has been a steep learning curve. I've had to turn on a light to see buttons too many times.\nI like the volume control. It has detents (clicks) so my cat is unable to adjust the volume. :-)\nFinally, setup for this clock REQUIRES READING THE MANUAL. I'm a very tech person but this radio would be impossible to set up without the manual."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: what i wanted..\nnumbers are easy to read.. don't much care for the yellowish hue of the backlight.. but its in the pic.. and what I expected.\nbuttons are easy to use.. easy to read directions.. easy to set up\nA plus it has 1\/10 increments on the radio dial\nI gave it a four not because of any performance issue... but just things I would like to be different.\nI would like a tone control.. its a little bassy for my bad ears\nbacklight hue would be nicer not so lit up.. its a large yellowish display... but again its in the pic\nI would like a removable backup battery for power outages.\nAn internal FM antenna would be nice to eliminate yet another cord or have the cord removable\nI would buy it again.. simple clock radios are difficult to come by. I don't need all the bells and whistles\nnow if they would just start making manual wind alarms and watches again...."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This clock radio has a very good radio that picks up stations the Sony that it replaced could not get clearly. The sound quality is also good for a clock radio. I like the digital tuning and the memories, and I like how the alarm starts soft and gradually grows louder. It gently wakes you up without startling you.\n\nThere are two minor drawbacks that I've experienced, the first being the display, which is very bright. I prefer the green on black numbers on the Sony. The second problem is that setting the alarm is complicated. My wife is not confident on how to do it, so I have to set it for her."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Outstanding item! I got this for my 90 year old father to replace his older radio. He keeps thanking me as I think he got used to cheap radios. This is easy to use, very well made, excellent signal to noise ratio. He plugs in his headset and we can even dial the brightness of the display easily."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: used just to listen to the radio with headphones at work. it was difficult to find a radio that wasn't too expensive but had the option of plugging in headphones and this was my best option and not too badly priced"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought two.  I loved them, so year later, I bought two more, and they had improved them!  My only quibble is that I wish they came in other colors."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Bought this for my 80+ year old mother.\nTook a long time to learn how to set it up - the manual was very difficult to follow.\nVery stable (as her prior radio used to drift off station - this one always stays locked), and good reception of local stations.\nI had thought it was an atomic clock-radio as many Sangean models are I think - but it is not. Stays set fairly well - rarely need to reset unless we have a long, day+ power failure."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: It is hard for me to figure out how to set the alarms. Simple clock radio ought to be easy to set up and us."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Can't say enough good about this radio except I ordered a second one the next day after I received the first and heard the sound and ease of programming. Brings in stations without static or drift that was impossible with other radios. Love the push buttons to quickly change from one station to another just like in a car."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Don't bother!  Had the radio for 6 months now. Radio stations no longer come in, alarm is difficult to set, and the alarm goes off at random times when not even set!  Contacted the manufacturer and had the worst customer service!  Save your money and don't buy."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: So far so good! My really likes this as this was our 5th clock radio. She'd \"love\" it if it came in something other than black or white but so far it's a good clock with a good radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Little backup when a power outage occurs.  The only thing saved is the station frequency -- no clock, no time off and on. If I were using this as a wake-up alarm it would be a good boat anchor.  Also, it is hard to program."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Difficult to follow setting instructions written by someone for whom English is a second language.\nIn a power failure all info disappears when power comes back on (like the time). My old clock retained that info.\nI like the size for a night stand. I like that you can turn the sound way down while trying to go to sleep.\nAfter 6 months I still have trouble setting the alarm. I use my phone instead."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I replaced my previous Sangean radio with this model.  While I loved my previous radio, for some reason the alarm function ceased to function after a few years.  The Sangean products seem to be well made and function just fine; I just hope I will not run into a similar problem with this new purchase."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It's a nice radio but not exceptional. The radio section is easy to operate and almost intuitive, not so for the clock\/alarm section which is a little more difficult to set. It does not have a true battery backup, the backup time of 10 minutes is really insufficient. Music sounds decent but talk from the single speaker has the typical \"boomy\" sound of most small AC radios. There are no tone controls. FM reception is good. I live in an urban area. When you switch bands to AM the volume drops very noticeably even on a strong station you will need to turn up the volume. AM reception is acceptable and inline with most AM radios. It seems to hold station very well. Signal sensitivity is average. It comes with a 6VDC wall wart and a note not to place the radio too close to the switching supply to avoid interference on AM. Claims the switching supply is mandated by the FCC. The radio is sensitive to noise produced by the OSRAM 40\/60W LED bulbs sold at BIG BOX stores, especially on weak stations. Also most, but not all, electronic ballasts on fluorescent lamps will screw up AM reception also, big time. Maybe the FCC should mandate something about this rather than telling manufacturers to save a 1\/4 watt of power. The AM antenna is internal, so for best reception you need to move\/turn the radio, hopefully you can still see the clock after this is done. The FM antenna is a two foot wire hanging out the back. Some radios use the AC cord for the FM antenna, this separates the two, probably the better solution. I ran my antenna under a place mat with a right angle bend. Seems to work without having to move it around and the antenna is invisible and out of the way. The 10 preset stations are nice and the reason I bought the radio. The display brightness is controlled by a trim pot on the bottom and works well, No more radio nightlights for me. Basically I am happy with the purchase. Keep the manual in the nightstand drawer for those times when 10 minutes is not sufficient."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Reception on the radio is poor, which is surprising considering it's a Sangean. Has a few feet long antenna in the form of a wire that appears ineffective. I've tried hanging it on walls, wiring another wire onto it, but it's just bad reception. Battery backup is atrocious. If your power goes out for more than 10 minutes........that's right, 10 minutes, the clock resets and loses the time. It does not automatically set the time when you plug it in or when it recovers from a power outage. You have to manually do it, and this is about the most unintuitive machine I've ever dealt with. Difficult to set the alarm, or the time. Radio is easy to use, but basically non-functional as a result of the poor reception.\n\nOn the bright side, it's pretty, and I like the display. Appears well put together, very solid. If you get reception, then the speaker is a joy to hear. However, as a result of the problems above, I switched back to my old RCA clock radio, which gets better reception. I drift off to BBC news on NPR during the overnight hours so the radio is a must."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a great choice for a full feature clock radio.  I researched and chose it primarily because if offers infinitely adjustable screen brightness.  This was important to me to find a right compromise for day and night viewing.  This product delivers.  Most other clock radios only offer a high\/low switch.  This is not nearly enough for me.  Also great is the \"humane wake system\" which gradually increases alarm or radio volume from zero to your max preset  volume.  Very pleasant to wake to after years of being jarred awake by my last product.  Radio sound quality is very good and reception strength is excellent:  able to pull-in weak stations.  Some have criticized the difficulty of setting the alarms.  There are several keystrokes necessary but if you bother to read the manual (a radical idea for some!) it is quite logical and not really a burden considering all the options available to you.  A lot of performance at a reasonable price!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: A really good clock radio.  Love that it comes on quiet, either radio or chime, and gets louder.  Excellent time display with adjustable brightness.  Easy alarm settings for M-F, weekend only, single day.  Remembers last setting if you disable alarm for day off and then need to reset alarm on. Most important for me -- radio volume goes very low to loud.  I tried another popular clock radio (with time projection, which is nice), but the lowest setting of 1 was waaaay too loud.  The Sangean is perfect.  Snooze is only 5 min, not the standard 9.  Looks smart on the nightstand."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: It's a little complicated to set the alarms, but the radio works well.  It remembers settings, so if you listen to a different station or change the volume some time during the day,  it will remember the station and volume you selected for waking up in the morning."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a great radio with lots of features.  I really like it except for one thing:  the buttons are all identical (except for the snooze) and are lined up in a straight row.  This means that you have to be sure which button your finger is on before pushing it.  I wish they would have varied the size\/position a bit.  Still, its a minor annoyance compared to the features of the radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I was looking for a clock radio that had an earphone jack.  This has that, and good sound quality, as well as preset stations and a nice appearance.  My only comment is.... when using the headphone jack, the speakers are disabled, even for the alarm. I would think that there should be some provision to make the alarm audible to waken the sleeper!  I do like the radio in spite of this.  You won't go wrong with it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The orange backlight is okay, but I think I prefer other types of digital clock displays.  Otherwise, it's a very good product, easy to setup."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I live between two major cities, Los Angeles and San Diego, and have had ongoing reception difficulties with clock radios. I have gone through probably a half dozen clock radios trying to find one that had the ability to receive either city's radio stations clearly. I like to listen to music in the morning when I'm getting ready for the day and every clock radio I had ever tried had major difficulties pulling in LA and\/or San Diego stations. Even moving my curling iron from one spot to another in the bathroom would cause the reception to fade in and out. If I moved away from the radio, the reception faded. This radio rocks! Not only does it pull in LA and San Diego stations clearly, but it has 5 programmable stations, so when the station goes to music I don't like or a commercial (or blathering DJs), I just punch a button and happiness reins again. Love it!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Good sounding alarm clock radio. I like to listen to the radio when I go to bed, but my wife doesn't.  This is the solution I was looking for.  I purchased this because of the head phone jack.  There are plenty of AM\/FM clock radio's on the market that will outperform this one.  If you don't need the aux out, buy something else."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Radio works fine. Nice small size.  But alarm is a problem. No matter whether set to come on as radio or alarm, 9 out of 10 times it comes on as alarm. And the alarm comes on at random times when not set.  Returned both radios."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Purchased this because I wanted a clock radio that had good reception and this is terrific.  The houses in our neighborhood were built 100+ years ago at the bottom of an old quarry.  So we have stone bluffs to the west and north of us - making radio and TV reception awful.  This radio has digital tuning and I am able to clearly receive signals for five of my favorite stations, including one independent low power station.  And reception is still good after my naughty cat chewed on the thin wire antenna taking off a good 12\" of its length.  And yes, the alarms work well, too.  Appreciate that the volume on them starts low and slowly increases.  Nicer way to start the day.  So happy with this purchase!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Love the Sangean products. Bought this because of earphone output which allowed for a pillow speaker (also Sangaen). Easy set up, light in front is adjustable, and buttons make it easy to use at night. Also, nice and compact."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Was advertised as have clean, clear reception in AM. Maybe it is the area where I live but the reception had lost of static and humming so I returned it."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: It arrived in early December of 2015. It died in late April of 2016, no power. It did what it was supposed to do - tell time and make sounds, until it stopped working. Very disappointed."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Radio works well and I like the (5) presets per band.  Small profile works very well.  Only possible improvement is a battery backup for power outages."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Best feature - alarm can be set for specific days of week.  It alarms Monday-Friday, and I don't have to turn the alarm off for the weekend.  Also like the way the alarm remembers the alarm station and volume setting, so can fall asleep to one station at night and wake to another, louder, in the morning.  Good sound quality too for a radio this size.\n\nOne quibble - why bother displaying seconds?"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I had been looking for a clock radio for a while now, and I noticed that the quality of clock radio's (without built-in cd players or iphone chargers) has decreased significantly since the late 90s or so. I stumbled across this particular clock being reviewed on Youtube, and decided to give it a shot. It is a bit pricier than I was expecting, but then again, since it seems clock radio's are more of a niche item these days, I guess that's understandable. I picked up the clock through warehouse deals, but having used it for the past few weeks, I would gladly pay Amazon's asking price for a new unopened box. The FM radio has decent reception, though it is sometimes disrupted if I place my phone near the clock. I only really listen to one station on AM for weather, and that station has good reception. I found the clock very intuitive to set up, but if you're a technophobe I can see how setting the alarms for the first time may be confusing. Once you get used to it though, not a problem at all. The best feature IMO is being able to set the volume at which the alarm comes on (for both the buzzer and the radio), independent of the volume at which the radio is last played. There's even an auxiliary device input, in case you want to connect your mp3 player, and use that as your alarm. Finally, I wasn't really looking for sound quality in an alarm clock, but I must say that the quality is much better than I would have expected from a clock radio. If you need a clock radio, look no further, it doesn't get much better than this for under  fifty bucks."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I am unable to set the clock appropriately. I wish to return it. The clock feature and timer feature do not coordinate. The settings for stations work well."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Brought for better reception,  but it was worse than 20 year old radio we had. Otherwise it was a good product.  That sounds sarcastic, but the two stations it did receive sounded much better than our old radio."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: The Sangean RCR-5 clock radio has excellent reception and sound.  Actually, its pretty amazing for a clock radio.  It has 5 AM and 5 FM presets, and a light brightness dial, which is located on the bottom of the unit.  There are two alarms that can be programmed independently of each other.\n\nI did not find this hard at all to program.  Since its so flexible, the alarm process does need to go thru its options to program to your likingshour, minute, awake alarm (buzzer or radio), band (if radio), station (if radio), alarm volume (yes, you can set the volume of the alarm separately from your last listening volume).  The radio automatically takes you to the next step that you need to answer.  Plus, it remembers your previous answers.  So, if you're one who only changes the time to wake, you basically hit the next, next, next button to program the alarm, only changing the time.  Both the buzzer and the radio start softly and get louder (HWS).\n\nBesides setting the alarm for one time, you can also set it for weekday, weekend, and all days.  There is a nap and a sleep function, both time programmable.  The snooze function is 5 minutes per snooze and not time programmable.\n\nI did have an issue:  I programmed for the radio to play on wake and the buzzer went off instead.  I called Sangean and spoke with a very knowledgeable tech, Bob, who explained that if the radio station reception is considered too weak, the buzzer would go off instead.  In my case, this was exactly what happened, even though *I* didn't think the station was weak."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: **Great Quality Product!!  Able to finally receive FM stations clearly, which I could never get in my room, Set the FM and AM pre-sets.  My hats off to Sangean America Inc., Would absolutely recommend, especially at the price-point..."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: The one serious drawback: it does not like LED bulbs. Turning the light on a bedside night table iinterferes with reception and drops the volume by about a third. Otherwise an excellent little alarm clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was so frustrated with my old Sony clock radio. With the manual tuning, I could only pick up about two stations and I live in a large metro area. I researched a lot of radios to make sure the one I was getting had a better tuner. Other radios said they had a great tuner but VERY complicated in setting up the alarms and time. I got my Sangean today and had it completely set up with station presets and two different alarms within 10 minutes. Very easy to operate and the digital tuning is excellent. I now can pick up stations that I never could with the Sony. I probably would give it 5 stars but I just got it today."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Use this in the kitchen and it works well . I also like that I can connect my iPod to it to listen to music. Nice radio all in all!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The radio is all I expected. I especially like the ability to push a button to find a station rather than fiddle with a knob."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent product. Very well designed easy to use and adjust. Radio is of good quality. I recommend this as a gift or for yourself. The alarm is really cool!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Having read the other reviews, I wasn't sure about ordering this radio. I followed the advise of others and took many pictures of the packaging, etc..\nThis radio is okay. The sound quality is not the best and setting it up does take some time but for the price, it is good."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very happy with this radio. It's attractive, good sound and multiple options. Most importantly for me, the digital display is large, but the lighting is not disturbing."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I like this clock radio except for a major shortcoming: setting the alarms is too complicated!  You almost need a computer science degree to program it!  I find the overall build quality to be quite good. The sound quality of the radio is quite good for a clock radio most  have a thin, tinny sound while the sound from the Sangean is full bodied."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I bought this radio because it was supposed to lock in hard to get AM signals. The radio I was going to replace this with was getting scratchy signals at night. Well, this is by far a much worse radio than the one I was going to replace it with. This radio gets NO signal on hard to get stations, nothing, just major static.  I am so tired of being lured into products that promise one thing... and that is the one thing their product does not do. Also, it has an AC adapter and very thin cord that is flimsy at best and is supposed to be some kind of energy saving adapter. I really want to return this radio and I suggest if you are looking for an AM radio for night listening this is not it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Arrived when promised.  Very happy with it so far.  Was looking for a alarm clock radio with a headphone jack.  Not many are made with one any more.  My old radio had trouble pulling in one of my favorite stations, this radio had no problem."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a fantastic clock radio. The digital radio is easy to use, very crisp and clear, no station drift with a nice sound.  The dual alarm is nice and I especially like the sleep timer.  One of the best features is that you can lighten or dim the display with a simple button on the bottom of the clock radio.  I wanted a well built, dependable clock radio and this certainly fit the bill. I highly recommend this product."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Bought because of the \"Sleep\" feature - to listen and fall asleep to a particular station at night.\nThe contrast between the numbers and the background is very low, with my -3 vision I cannot see them if I wake up.\n\nEasy to mix up the nap and the sleep features which means you will be woken up by a loud sound just as you've fallen asleep.\n\nAntenna is quite good."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Very complicated to set up. Stopped working 32 days after it arrived. Return policy said it was too late to return it, but Amazon made it right!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: So far, so good. I like the weekday\/weekend options for alarms. It's is quite a process to set and reset, and very strange that the battery back-up doesn't keep the time for more than a few minutes but it turns out it did keep the alarm setting (although I didn't know it until I had gone through several steps of the setup). Good dimmer and display, don't need the seconds so that's just one more step you have to do and how do I find the correct \"second\" we're at anyway?"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: We got a black one of these in December and the clock didn't work (couldn't set it). We sent that one back and the new one seemed fine for a while until we realized that it was losing 1 minute per day, so every few days we'd have to fix the time on it. It is supposed to have some kind of satellite that adjusts the clock, but it doesn't seem to work properly. By the time we realized this, it was too late to return it to Amazon. Now Sangean wants us to pay them to ship it back to them and diagnose the problem and then they will decide if they want to fix it or give us a new one. At this point we don't want a new one!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Just what I expected and more.  Sound is very good for its size.  Some practice is needed to set the alarm but nothing I could not accomplish using the manual.  Having a battery backup system, when losing the power in the house, would have been nice but this model does not have it.  10 minute backup system might be enough, will find out.  All in all very happy with the purchase."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I don't know why but I am unable to set the date - when I hit the set time button it reverts back to the time so the day and date are always off.\nAlso I wish I could manually tune in the stations.  Otherwise the clock radio is adequate for my needs so I won't be returning it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Exactly perfect for a person with poor eye sight to use in the kitchen.  Simple to use. Excellent reception.  Very good sound quality.  Buttons have tactile click which is incredibly helpful.  Display and functions are not overly complicated."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love my new alarm clock!  I love that I can dim the display light!  I love the preset stations!  I especially love that it has great reception for radio stations that are quite far away that I never used to be able to listen to!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It functions OK. Would have liked more FM presets. Really don't need the ones for AM.\nThe alarm setup is really quirky. I must have made a slight adjustment, and the #1 alarm switched from radio to the soft alarm, resulting in me waking up later. You essentially have to completely go through the alarm setup again to fix it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I purchased this as a gift for my mother since all the reviews looked like this was some miracle of technology, especially since all the other clock radios made today look so cheap. The radio is OK... but isn't worth the price we paid, not by a long shot."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Programming the alarm was a little more in depth than I would prefer, but it is quite doable. I like the way that the music turns louder slowly in increments so as not to startle you awake. Very happy"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent reception and sound quality. Not simple to work with, wish the lights were in red , not too bright. I am happy with this purchase"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The Sangean RCR-5 radio works out great for me. I strung out the FM antenna wire and taped it under the edge of the kitchen divider in my apartment. Had no problem setting up the memories or the date and time.. FM reception is good. AM reception is susceptible to the usual pickup of appliance noise. However, strong local AM stations are OK.  It's not being used as an alarm clock radio. I have another Sangean for that.\nI have it on the kitchen divider and listen to it in kitchen and dining area. Speaker on top allows good sound from any side."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this radio alarm clock for my husband and he loves it!  Some settings were not intuitive but after he read the instructions, he really loves the unique features this clock offers. Pluses are: infinitely variable background light - from complete black to bright orange, great sound for an alarm clock, can program 2 wake-up schedules - He uses 1 for the work week and the 2nd for each weekend day as desired, No need to reset your clock every night. Can even program the volume of the alarm (or radio) and the alarm starts out really soft and then progressively increases in volume until it then starts changing tone variations to ensure you wake up.  Has easy to find snooze bar but also will turn off for 1 minute if not turned off and then resume a minute later.  Light to turn off is dimly lit so you can see in dark and once pressed lights up the display temporarily showing \"OFF\" and then the time before it dims back down.  Has a sleep feature.  The only con noted is the skinny uncomfortable knob used to adjust the backlight which is inconveniently located underneath the unit."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I wanted a clock radio with good reception and sound quality, a display easy to dim or brighten, and a modest footprint. So I read a lot of Amazon reviews and decided to try the Sangean for reception.  This model fits all my criteria and I love that it starts quietly and slowly gets louder.  The reception is excellent and the calm colored amber light can be dimmed more than my light sensitive eyes require.  No need for the sleep mask now. The speaker jack is a nice bonus as I have a set of speakers positioned on each side of the bed for use with my mp3 player.  Very pleased with this purchase."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Really nice. Other reviews say the display is difficult to read. I don't understand - it's not lighthouse-bright like some clock radio (doesn't light up the room), but it's easy enough to read. I especially like the \"soft on\" feature (when you set wake to alarm, the radio volume ramps up, rather than hitting you full-blast). I also like being able to program 1 radio station to wake me during the week days, and another station for the weekends. Radio reception is EXCELLENT - there's an FM station we like, which fades and drifts badly on 2 other radios, but comes in perfectly on this one."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Good radio. Wonderful\nClock no visibale.\nAlarm difficult to operate. Peoblem to relate on alarm. No baterry back up although in catalog promised 10 min, backup"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I like the radio with digital tuning much better that then trying to dial in a radio station.  When waking up to the radio, the volume gradually increases and this is a nice feature as well.\n\nMy only cons is that I have a hard time reading the time at night ( with my glasses off ) compared to other clock radios that I've owned which had higher contrasts between the numbers and the background."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Highly selective and sensitve tuner great clock radio for the price! This suits all my needs. I use this as a external speaker for my music on my phone\nI especially like the feature where you have the ability to set the volumes at different levels for sleeping and waking up, this is very useful. I highly recommend  this to others."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Okay, but hard to read the display because of golden color(too light) .  Better to get a red, blue or green display to read clock.  Okay."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Plus:  The radio has great sound and all of the mentioned features are very, very good.  Repeat, for a non stereo unit, the sound is very good.\nMinus:  The unit was built for DC and there is a clunker of an adapter to deal with.  For most people, this would not be a problem, but for where I use it I would be happier with a normal AC plug.\nNever heard of this brand, but I think it represents real quality.  I am very happy with the radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this for my wife and she loves it! OK fellas, I also bought other things. She just needed an alarm clock that not only did the alarm during the week but did an alarm differently on the weekends. This works great! Also, has the feature where when the alarm goes off, it starts out softly then get a little louder. Perfect for waking up without wanting to beat the crap out of an alarm. Very happy with this product."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I went out on a limb getting this, and I love it. I will always buy Sangean products when possible from here on out. Love love love this clock. The alarm and radio-alarm options are very nice. I've been needing a gradually louder alarm for 20 years, and finally realized shopping online was better than just buying whatever they had on the shelf at a local store. My only gripes, which are outweighed by the positives, are that my favorite FM station has static half the time (all radios in my house have that problem with that station so...) and when I adjust the display to not too bright at night, it is too dim in the day. I read that in another review and they were right about the display brightness, but since I knew that going into it I forgive the clock. I really just wanted a great alarm and a good enough radio in my bedroom in the morning. It passes with flying colors on those two criteria!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I always keep a clock radio in my bathroom, mainly so I can listen while laying in the tub reading, and to tell what time it is of course. I don't care about alarms so I haven't used them, but otherwise I am very pleased with this product.\n\nI've only had it for 24 hours so things could change, but having a digital tuner is a huge plus, jump between presets with a simple touch of a button. I wish the On\/Off button was different than the rest (it is identical to all the others), and the dial volume control is kind of a hassle (I'd prefer a +\/- bar like for tuning and time setting) but it will work. Aux audio in, and an output jack as well, have not been used yet but you can bet they will. The unit is a little larger than I hoped but I can work around that. The price was right and arrived in 2 days. Easy to set up, and the radio actually works really well, picking up all the stations I prefer here in the general Dallas area.\n\nAll in all, 4 big stars overall. Would buy again for sure."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very happy with this guy. Wish the power cord didn't stick out so far in the back before you can bend it. Functionally it works well and is pretty eassy to get the assorted alarms set up."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I've had this for over a year.  At first I could set the alarm (with difficulty - controls are not intuitive) for weekdays only and for a radio station.  The power went out and it lost its settings.  I have read and reread the instructions but it will only let me set the alarm for the beeping noise (no radio) and every day, not weekdays only.  I travel a lot so I am used to different styles of alarm clocks and have no difficulty figuring out those even without instructions. The only thing I like is that, unlike my old clock radio, this one doesn't \"slip\" off the radio station because it's digital.  The dial is very bright at night even on the dimmest setting.  I'll be replacing this and relegating it to \"radio only\" duty in my office.  Maybe I got a lemon.  I always read other purchasers' reviews before buying and others seem to like this radio alarm clock a lot.  Not me."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Simple set up. Nice wall plug that isn't too big. Sangean RCR-5 is an ease to program -- as I wrote \"simple\". The display is easy on the eyes. What I like is the ability to program wake up alarms for weekdays and weekends. Nice touch. Digital tuning. An FM antenna that can be stretched for better reception. (I left it bundled up on the hope it would receive nearby stations -- it did!)\n\nOverall, easy to use, easy on the eyes and easy on the pocket book."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Looked for a radio that wasn't to pricey, but would have a lot of features I wanted. This has everything I wanted, & it wasn't that expensive; came promptly too. I had no problem; very satisfied with my purchase from this person(s)."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: If you are like most buyers, you have already researched the best alarm clocks, like I did.  Apparently, the market is slim out there for these.  I have tried several, and this one is one of the better ones.  It is easy to program the time, and radio stations.  It sounds pleasant to wake up to with the volume progressively gets louder when it turns on.  The touch and feel have a quality appeal.\n\nPros:\n\n1.  Accurate time and alarm (iHomes I have tried gain time)\n2.  Sufficiently large enough digital display\n3.  Conveniently located on\/off and snooze buttons\n\nCons:\n1.  I would recommend backlit numbers.  They are easier to read, especially when waking up.\n2.  Most people don't know the Sangean brand, so I would recommend more branding.\n3.  I would also recommend pronouncing the size of the On\/Off button, as it would be easier to find by touch."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: What drew me to this clock was the Humane Waking System- what a good idea.  Most alarm clocks scare you awake.  What I like about this clock....The display's brightness is easy to control.  Radio reception is stellar for an alarm clock\/radio.  Of course, the HWS.  It has two alarms.\nWhat I don't like.....It's so complicated to set the alarm! I guess if you always get up at the same time it's no biggie, but it's a pain in the neck if you have to change it often like I do.  The snooze button is only 5 minutes! Yes, 5 minutes!  Sorry I bought it.  The darned thing will probably last forever since it's built so well."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: May 8,2017 Update:\nI use this clock radio every night before bed and it works well.  However, I knocked it down 2 stars because some of the radio preset buttons are not working properly, they either jump to another band or the sleep timer.  1 1\/2 years is too short of a time for this to start malfunctioning. My previous Sony lasted nearly a decade without any trouble. I would buy another brand in the future.\n\nI wanted this particular clock radio for 2 years but waited until my Sony finally broke, and it did.\nThe quality seems good, like I thought it was based on the reviews.  The buttons are spaced out and\nare made to handle constant channel changing.  The amber light is controlled from high to off on the bottom of the unit\n\nThe radio reception is better than my Sony, which is impressive. The clock has daily M-F buzzer along with a weekend buzzer.\nTwo alarm settings.  The alarm sounds better than other sounding ones I've had in the past.\nOverall, it's worth it at this price point.  I just hope it last 15 years like my Sony.\n\nUPDATE: 1\/4\/2017.  Just over 1 year later and this radio still works very well.\nUpdate: 1\/15\/2018: I junked this Sangean and bought a Sony Dream Machine on Amazon model ICF-C707"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I am an AM radio junkie, political talk, sports, weather and old time radio shows are the treasures I search for every night.  I live 50 miles from Chicago and this little radio picks up all my favorite stations.  On the FM band I have found two NPR stations I didn't know existed."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is my fourth Sangean radio in addition to a Sangean weather radio.  They are all different models used for different purposes around the house.  I still have them all and use them daily.  Each one has great sound and performs flawlessly.  Sangean is now my first choice when looking for a radio for my use, or as a gift."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Bought this for my dad who needed a new clock radio. He is 83 so needed something simple and easy to use. This is both and is well made. Also looks nice in his night stand as well."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Excellent radio! The digital tuner provides a crisp FM signal. The ;human wakeup alarm\" is a gentle way to be awaked - no abrupt buzzer or radio - just a slowing increasing volume that eases into your subconscious without triggering an adrenaline spike. Radio replaced a ~30 year set with analog tuning what was never 'quite' on station and had a blaring alarm."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great clock radio.  I was looking for one with an earphone jack to play the radio at night under my pillow.  This is one of the few I have found.  Love it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Easy to set up. I barely referred to the instruction manual.  The date, time, alarms and preset 1 are done. I programmed preset 1 to my favorite classical music station. Helluva great sound for a non-HD, non-stereo radio. A relative of mine just bought this Sangean and is very happy with it as well. Like the fact that there is a headphone jack for private listening, or just connecting my iPhone to the auxiliary jack."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a great clock radio that will blow others out of the water. Great classic styling, easy to set up, easy to read and the radio is powerful, pulling in weak station and the sound quality is excellent. Dollar for dollar, this is one of the best buys out there.\nThe company I ordered it from was excellent. They replied immediately after order was placed, box that radio came in was undamaged and it arrived in a short period of time."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: One of the few clock radios in this price range that has digital tuning. For its size it really sounds great!  Sony has nothing to compare\/compete with this radio- very happy with purchase and highly recommend."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Great little alarm clock radio. The gradual alarm is so much nicer than the usual blaring ones. Includes an antenna for the decent-for-the-price radio. Came well packaged."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Fantastic, sophisticated clock radio. Allows me to listen to pillow headphone (I like to fall asleep with the radio on and my husband no longer complains) yet still wakes me up with audible alarm (even with the out jack plugged in). You can designate what channel and how loud the wake-up alarm uses.  So if you are listening to music at a loud volume before bed - no worries - it will wake you up with music or talk at a volume of your choice.  Can dim display brightness to your liking.  Feature rich.  Be sure to read the manual to take full advantage of robust options."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: We were looking for a replacement for our 37 year old GE clock-radio-phone. Actually, it didn't die, it just wouldn't shut off. Enter the Sangean. We thought we had a winner with it, even though it didn't have a phone. We loved the features: an alarm that gradually increased in sound, preset radio stations, compact in size, and what seemed to be a clear display. The display turned out to be more than we could live with - just too bright!. I figured out how to turn down the brightness (knob on the bottom of the unit), but down too low I couldn't read the time. Yellow is not a conducive background color for reading the numbers while glowing in the dark. Turning off the light was of course, no solution as nothing could be read. I am nearsighted, and even with the clock radio about a foot away it was too difficult for me to read it. I had no problem with the GE - that display was black numbers on a red background. I've heard that a yellow display light is difficult for eyes to adjust to, something about the cones in the eyes. We returned the unit."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Works fine but my need was AM reception because of area I live in. I have had the Sangean portable radio which has great reception and expected at least equal reception with this plug-in. As noted, it works fine but has limited AM reception."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Sadly, this thing bit the dust after 3 months.  The alarm seems to only go off when it feels like it.  Set it for weekdays and it woke me up on Saturday.  Seems no way to get the alarm to stop either, no bar or button works.  Attempted a reset, which, realistically you need three hands for, and pressed and pressed all the buttons and nothing happened.  Waste of money for me, and going to buy a different brand."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: good product how ever i was looking for an alarm clock that i can set for all seven days at once. the alarm being set for each separate day to go of at the times of my choosing. i think there is a different model by this company that has the said function . how ever i already got this one."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: This clock\/radio has lots of settings to deal with, then two months after the warranty ran out it broke.  Manufacture said radio was not suppose to come on while setting, so it was broke from the start.  Reset it to factory settings a number of times but was still unable to set radio stations.  This radio was junk for $40.00.  Seller said sorry too late to report and that they no longer make the radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I've owned and used a lot of clock radios over the years but this one is probably the best.\n\nIt's very easy to use.  The layout and size of the buttons are nice, all the buttons make sense, the manual is short and sweet, and within 3-4 minutes I had the whole thing figured out.  The unit is light but sturdy and the underside has nice, even support, allowing you to slide the unit easy around your night stand without making any noise.\n\nThe digital tuner is great.  No more old imprecise analog tuners.  You lock right onto the station you want.  The signal is clear and the FM antenna is a good addition.  Other reviews do mention a transformer hum, which is audible when the radio is on, but I'm very sensitive to this sort of thing and the hum is very low on mine, and is not bothersome at all.  The sound quality is very good.  It's still a clock radio speaker so don't get too excited, but it's probably the best sounding one I've heard.  The volume knob is large and easy to find.  It moves incrementally and the volume is represented digitally so you can remember specific volume settings for listening or for your alarms.\n\nThe display is a pleasant amber and the backlight brightness is fully adjustable by an analog knob on the bottom of the unit allowing exact control.  This is a great feature for anyone sensitive to the ridiculous amount of light that's put out by most LED clock displays; even the ones with a \"dim\" setting are insanely bright.  With this one you can go as dim as you like.  The only issue here is that the contrast becomes lower as the display gets dimmer, so the digits don't pop when the display is very dim.  They aren't nice and black against the backlight, they're more like a dimmed grey.  So if you have poor eyesight and you like things dim, you may not be able to easily make out the time in the middle of the night without getting close to the display.  But this is far better than being blinded by LED floodlights.  I also like the information layout.  I like having the seconds tick along next to the hh:mm, but the seconds digits are smaller and look like they're just tagging along.  A nice touch.\n\nAll the other listed features round out the device.  Station presets, alarm schedules, slowly-increasing volume for the alarms, and aux\/headphone jacks.\n\nThe power adapter is somewhat fat, but should fit fine in most standard duplex outlets top or bottom.  The cable is about 5 feet long, which is a little short for my taste but it seems to be the clock radio standard."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This clock radio is the least intuitive of any radio alarm clock that I have ever owned.\nIt is difficult to set and to have the alarm go off for just one date.\n\nI really dislike this product"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Got free shipping.  Received it two days after it shipped.  Of Course it did not ship for 5 days after I purchased it, or something like that.  I didn't care, shipping was still free.  Radio is OK.  I don't look for any product to be really good any more.  The little hotel type alarm clock that this Sangean replaced was better.  I think it was analog though.  I only paid 10.00 dollars for it at WM, several years ago.  I live in the middle of two 50,000 watt radio stations. One hundred miles either way.  One I get OK the other one that I like to listen to, not so good.  Little antenna not worth much, Would not buy supplement copper wire to run outside and add to the cost. Actually, now that I think about it, the only stations besides those two that I do receive,  are the Mexican stations there are plenty of them,  and they are all loud and clear,but I think they could be coming out of Mexico.  They walk all over all my other prospects for listening. Can't say I'm totally disappointed because I just use it when I wake up and can't sleep."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Does everything we need it to do. Nothing more. Nothing less.\nHas AM and FM. Has an earbud jack. Tuning capability is adequate with its little wire antenna. Volume level is good."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Works well except hard to hit alarm button off until you get used to how tiny it is and its location on the top of the alarm."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Clock radio has good features, alarm, snooze, nap, etc. Good reception.\n My problem is that the  directions for the setting of the alarm seem more difficult\nthan they really are. Very hard to see days of week, weekend, etc. options for setting alarm. Very tiny; I have to go get my glasses and\nput them on to see the days. Never quite sure if I have the right day for the alarm. Some electronic symbols appear on dial, but again\nare very small to read. Glad I could get it in black color for bedroom."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I initially rated this only 3 stars because after 13 months, the volume control stopped working, but 12 hours later it was mysteriously working fine.  I can't explain it,  Reading other reviews, the volume knob failing doesn't seem to be a common problem.  A certain proportion of reviewers had other types of failures, but that seems to be the case for all clock radios as I discovered while shopping for a replacement.  So I would not necessarily recommend avoiding this one if it appeals to you otherwise.\n\nAs far as the pros and cons, the other reviews cover them thoroughly, although with conflicting opinions.  My take on the areas that seem controversial:\n* FM reception: This is why I picked this one to begin with and it worked fine for me once I got the antenna wire in the right position.  My old clock radio had an internal antenna, as most do, and was not adequate in my current location.  The Sangean's external antenna mad the difference I needed.\n* AM reception:  I don't listen to AM, so I don't know, but based on other reviews, I would not buy this if I wanted AM.\n* Controls ans settings: Yes, they're a little complicated and not intuitive, but I was able to figure them out by reading the manual and the ones I use regularly became second-nature.\n* No battery backup: Almost all clock radios have this feature, even cheap ones.  I can't understand why this one doesn't.  On days I absolutely did not want to oversleep, I set my cellphone alarm as backup."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It does not set the time automatically.  And the alarm is not as easily adjustable as on other clock radios.  The feature I like is that it accommodates headphones."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I wasn't familiar with this brand. And it seemed like a relatively hefty price for a simple AM\/FM clock radio. But I decided to take a shot because of the digital tuner.\nSo far I haven't had any problems with the station fading out. There's been no waking up to static or having to feel around & try to tune in a station on an analog tuner that you can't see & even if you could, was often not properly calibrated.\nThe sound is pretty decent for what it is, especially when compared to some of the others I've had.\nThe negatives are: The display is hard to read under some conditions & especially at a distance. However this hasn't been a problem for me since it's right next to my bed where I can see it.\nAlso the controls are a little hard to see. And the alarm & on\/off buttons are easily mistaken for the station preset buttons in the dark with your eyes half shut.\nI can't remember off the top of my head whether or not this is supposed to automatically adjust for daylight savings time. But I did have to manually set it back an hour when  they changed over last month.\nIt is pretty easy to set though.\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this radio& would recommend it to anyone who needs a quality digital tuner to keep their favorite stations locked in and sound quality that's better than most similar radios."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love he fact that I can use head phones to listn to the radio. I haven't figured out how to set the alam for a one time use et but over all I love it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Great reception without interference in a location that has had a history of poor reception. So far the only complaint is too many functions on nearly identical buttons. They are all same size, closely located together without function separation wide enough to feel or even see in dim lighting. Very small print as well identifying function. As a result several false starts of an unintended function, break out the lights and step through canceling things like \"nap\" that are a bit difficult to just turn off."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I really like this radio.  It has good sound quality and the settings are fairly easy to understand.  I had one glitch where I had cancelled a tone alarm but the alarm went off anyway.  But I think the radio just got confused.  The digital tuning is very good.  The back light can be adjusted for brightness.  Very happy with my purchase."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I really wanted to like this clock radio . . . .\nbut I hate it and just threw it out.  I had it for two years.\nPros:  can set the light so it is fairly dim, so it doesn't bother you at night.  Can program five radio stations.  Two alarms.\nCons:  my unit had a terrible hum when the radio was on.  Reception was sub-par.  Perhaps most annoying is that when you turn the alarm on or off, it emits a shrill beep, which can wake your sleeping partner.  Changing the time for the alarm to go off also requires many steps which have a beep after each step--again, not good when you come to bed later than your partner and you need to change your wake up time.  Likewise, if you wake up before your alarm and want to shut the alarm off, again you must press a button that will beep loudly.  I usually ended up just turning the volume all the way down.  That's when you really notice the odd hum when the radio was on.  I just got a cube Sony clock with projector and so far it's great, much better radio reception and buttons that don't beep when turning the alarm on and off."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is exactly what I was looking for.  I purchased it after reading the reviews on Amazon.  Set up was easy.  The color, white, was an important feature for me.  It also has a headphone outlet, which was a must.  I am super pleased with my purchase!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I shop for months looking for just the right alarm clock. I am always disappointed within months when some aspect of it stops working, especially when I pay a good amount of money for it.  I have had this for only a few weeks but I am very happy, so far.  I don't use it for a time-piece to view. I have it located on a shelf on the wall. It is just for the alarms only. I also have it resting on its side so that the speaker is sounding in the direction that has the greatest impact.  I like that I can set dual times and for each time I can set for the weekdays or the weekends or both, separate volumes, and different stations if I wanted. Once the alarm goes off, it will automatically turn itself off in one hour. Since I set this alarm clock up, I haven't touched it once. I really really really like that feature. I have always used the one hour timer auto-shut-off timer on alarms as a way to get me out the door in a timely manner. Works perfectly.  For the money I paid, I should be able to get a couple years out of this alarm if it is made well. I sure hope so cuz I am tired of shopping for alarm clocks every six months."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Great radio, and has a lot of features for the price.  One thing I really liked is that the alarm still sounded even though the head phones were plugged in.  This means I can fall asleep to the radio and still have an alarm in the morning.!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This radio does everything I wanted it to.  It has a \"nap\" setting where you can have it turn off after a certain amount of time - just right for going to sleep to.  Also has a jack for headphones to I don't disturb my husband."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I find the numbers on this clock hard to see at night.  It does take some reading of the manual to set things up.  The alarm works well."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: I really dislike this clock. The numbers are almost impossible to see in the middle of the night--there's no contrast, just a bright orange bar. No matter how I adjust it, the numbers are next to unreadable, especially at night. So aggravating. The sound quality on the radio is excellent, and I do like how the radio alarm comes on softly and then increases in volume. But really...a clock radio where the clock is almost unusable?"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Cool orange display. The digital tuner is awsome seems to be well built I like it alot better than my SONY. A bit pricey but worth it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great product. Very good quality. Good reception, and good sound. Pretty easy to use. Has good features, but not too many features like some other complicated alarm radios. Love it."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: This item met my requirements for a an attractive bedside clock radio with a decent sound system.  Having bought Sangean products in the past I predicted I would get a quality product.  Unfortunately, setting the alarm has baffled me inspite of following the directions. Part of the problem is that the prompts are too small and, at least in my case, a second hand is needed to set the alarm. It seems to me that a person with several degrees can figure this out but it hasn't happened yet. So far the alarm worked once but I consider that a fluke."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The radio is fine but for two design elements that bug me. First, the dial to control the display brightness is underneath the unit, do you need to use two hands to adjust it. Second, being able to set alarms for weekdays or weekends is fine, hug it also then means that it's more complicated to set a basic alarm."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am happy to say that after much searching I found an AM\/FM clock radio that has both a sleep function that turns the radio off after a set number of minutes and a headphone\/earbud jack that allows me to listen to the radio without disturbing my wife.  The device has more functions that I have yet to either use or explore, such as a nap button as well as two alarm settings.  The user can preset five AM and five FM stations.  It is exactly what I wanted in a clock radio and so much more."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a great little radio.  Use it on some shelves in my bathroom.  Not great fidelity, but little radios aren't meant for that.  Love the adjustable display light - works great as a nightlight for the bathroom."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It works fine. I just wish it had a remote( I'm almost 70 and don't fly out of bed :-) - but it's fine for now.\n  Thanks - Bob"}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: I just bought it. Now it won't work. No face, no time, nothing. When it worked it was a 5 star. Sending it back :("}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The sound quality of this radio is very good; it's actually much better than my old Sony Dream Machine.  The display is bright and easy to read, and overall this is a good clock radio\/alarm clock.  Two must-haves for me are missing, hence the 2-star deduction.  1.  An adjustable screen brightness feature (this has one level of brightness: super bright, light the room bright).  2.  A gradual audio fade-out on the sleep timer (this shut-off was so abrupt that it woke me up, thereby defeating the purpose of a sleep timer).  If you don't care about brightness and fade-out, this is fine.  If you do care, it is a non-starter."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Just got it 10 hours ago. Unless you have a magnifing glass do not try to read diagram in the manual..  Very confusing to set up, icons on the display  are so small you havecto guess if what you set is right.  Guess i will know in morning if i set it for radio or Alarm.  I live within 10 miles of the transmitter for WTIC-AM a 50,000 watt radio station.  I can listen to that station 100 miles away in Vermont but not here in visual distance of the Antennas.\nIn fact i cannot get any AM stations at all.  I have reached out to Sangean and can't wait to have them tell me its not the radios fault but mine.  Old radio got same station innsame location and it was a piece of junk. FM is good but wire antenna is crap.  Backlight can be adjusted but before you ge it dimmed you realize you can no longer read the time.\n\nHey Amazon, do you sell time machines ?  Need to go back in time to when things were made to work and last..to when the companies cared about quality.  Now no one cares about anything.  Quality is no longer important.  Sangean obviously does not care."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: this clock radio is the best. So many more features, than other bedside clock radios. Not just sleep timer, but nap timer too! Easy to program, backlit so it's easy to see in the dark. Love it!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Love the clock. Great sound. Alarm set is a little funky, but not too bad. If you use the same time every day,it's great. You just shut off in the morning and your all set for the next day."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this clock radio (RCR-5) for \"her\" side of the bed and the big brother RCR-22 for \"my\" side of the bed. Really, it's almost the same clock. The RCR-22 has one or four more bells and whistles (for example, two automatic time setting modes) but the RCR-5 is really a solid performer. Fit and finish are excellent it doesn't feel like a \"cheap hotel\" clock either. Excellent radio reception. The sound is well above average for a mono speaker (I'm going out on a limb and going to say it actually sounds BETTER than the RCR-22 in a side by side comparison). Dual alarms. Digital tuner. Internal battery backup. Dimmable display trim knob. AUX in and headphone out. Nap function is handy for me but uses the beeper to wake in nap mode instead of the radio is my only complaint (like people who nap have much to complain about). Easy to set, just \"long press\" on the buttons when you need to change something and use the +\/- on the snooze button to adjust, then \"select\". I would buy this again. It's one of the best alarm clocks available today (and I looked high and low) and is also affordable. I may end up switching the two clock radios (if she lets me)!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love it!  This is my second Sanjean radio. The first is a portable that I bought a few years ago and still use. When I needed a new radio for my bedroom, I immediately looked at Sanjean.  Both are excellent in every way."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I kind of had a notion that this would be a quality product... I thought correctly. What I didn't plan on was HOW much I love this Clock radio. It doesn't just meet my expectations it exceeds them by a factor of a Million. I was on a quest to get a quality Alarm clock radio since my Panasonic was damaged in a move years ago and I have found, in this, something that makes me stop my quest. I would say I was on a quest on par with the hunt for the perfect pillow. This kind of reminds me of a miniature Bose wave radio in its build quality."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: My dad is older, and really picky about his radios.  After trying 2-3 other radios and complaining about size, sound, features, etc, he finally had me buy this one for him.  He LOVES it!  He praises the controls, the clarity, the sound quality, and everything about the radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I had it for a few week now and still learning about this radio. I follow the insert but sometimes, I lose the station. This is nice looking radio which does not take up much of space. It came with 10 preset stations. The nap feature is cool- set the nap time, beeps and turn it off."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I like this radio.  Reception is good, better than the one I had.  I didn't think setting the clock was as difficult as some of the reviews I read had said it was."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Great quality radio with good reception of weak stations and good sound.\n\nBought a second one but in this one the front panel lighting is not uniform.  The side edges are bright where the light bulbs are located but the center is dimmer.  Minor flaw but can make the viewing time not as as easy."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Sangean quality. However the contrls are not very easy to use. We always have to get out the owners manual. Also if power out more than a few min we have had issues"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The sound quality is good but it was difficult to set up the radio because it has so many settings.  Spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to disable the alarms."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: A very well made clock radio. The only thing I would change is the display. Hard to see a sharp image without correction. Even after repeated adjusting of the backlight level. This was not the case with my previous RED LED clock. Volume control is top notch. Tuner is great. Layout of product is well done and logical. A very good buy."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great features, and great radio reception, which is important to me. Good size, too. Setting the alarm is a bit complicated, but worth it. You can choose what radio station to wake to, even if you listen to a different station the night before. I've been looking for just the right clock\nclock radio for years and this is finally it."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Ordered 2 of these.  Thesee feel solid and good quality except that one of then is fast by 6 minutes per hour and loses the alarm setting."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I've had this radio for 3 years and had difficulty turning in most AM stations.  Luckily, the two AM\/FM stations I wanted to listen to came in late at night, so the radio served its purpose.  Recently I accidently knocked it off the night stand (it only fell 2 feet to a carpeted surface), but lost all AM reception.  Still get the FM stations, but to me it's useless unless I can get both.  I live in Tulsa, OK and never understood why I could only get one AM station. Everything else seemed to work fine. No sure I can send it back for repairs."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Very disappointed in this clock radio.  In order to change the alarm you have to go through 5 steps. You can't change the radio volume for the alarm by adjusting the volume manually.  You have to use the procedure to change the alarm. This is very time consuming In addition to that the volume is a number so that you have to keep experimenting to get the correct volume.. Wouldn't buy this clock radio again."}

{"review":"This is a positive review: Yes, I am satisfied from the product. It took some time until it arrived because you can't ship  it directly to my address, and I needed to use my friend's address and waited until he comes to Israel. Unfortunately, the power unit supplied was not suitable to Israel voltage and I should purchase another one at cost of $10.00.\nShimon Feuchtwanger"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The locations of the buttons could be done better - the \"nap\" button is right next to the one that turns the radio on and to turn off the nap feature, you have to go through all the cycles.  Same with many of the other buttons.  It would be nice if they used a raised marking on the alarm buttons to distinguish them from the ones that are used to program the radio stations.  However, I really like the unit."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Complicated; takes a while to figure out to use its features.  Wish it had a USB plug and a battery back-up that would eliminate the need to reset after an extended period of power loss.  Otherwise an excellent clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I looked long and hard to find a quality dual alarm clock radio that I could listen to without white noise on it, that would lock into the stations and this radio sure fits my needs.  First, it really has great sound quality.  I have been able to set up all the things like date\/the time, program the stations so don't need to search, the alarm, nap timer, all.  No problem.  Easy to follow instructions.  It has a very attractive appearance, a good size, not too large, doesn't take up much room on bed side table, looks quality, not cheaply made, very nice.  I like the amber color and the light is diimmable, you can brighten or dim the light using a small white knob located on the under side of the radio.  The amber color is very soothing (to me)..  Radio came packaged well.  I like that it has a 10-minute battery back-up which will come in handy if disconnected for a short time.  But what was really important to me was a radio with a good quality of sound.  And it has that.  I listen to radio a lot and can't have anything else.  Very glad I took the time to check out the reviews, I felt I had a 'heads up' before I purchased this radio and am definitely not disappointed in the least.  Attractive, easy to use, great sound, it seems to have it all.  I didn't expect to find a clock radio with an alarm of this quality in this price range.  But I did."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Reception in our office building isn't great but it is better than two other radios I purchased at W-world and returned for a refund. There is a cord for an attempt at an antenna and the dimmer is completely adjustable now. It is located on the bottom of the unit as a little knob. Spend the money for this and it will be a better quality and longer lasting than even Sony.\n\nI also recommend this brand if you want one for the shower. Best shower radio ever!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great little radio purchased for the office to replace something thats been sitting in the break room for god only knows how many years.  Digital tuner  is great, easy to learn and set up.  Sound is clear and loud enough."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It's not that easy to set an alarm and I can't tell just by looking at it if it is set.  I do use it.  Thank you..."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Pretty much as described and reviewed, but the radio sound quality is really all you can expect from the small speaker and there is no \"bass boost\" or other enhancement technology that I can detect (some reviewers raved about the sound quality...I don't know why?  Other than that it is a very good little clock radio that is small, but easy to see day and night (the adjustable backlight should please most users).  If all you need is an alarm clock and aren't particular about the radio, then this is a little pricey."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I just received this yesterday and I already love it.  It's pretty small and good-looking.  After reading some of the reviews about the difficulty in setting it up, I was a little put off, but it turned out to be quite simple.  It's replacing a radio in my bathroom that had a big fat cord so it's great to have the thin AC adaptor cord which can be tidily wrapped up (since I need only about a foot of length to reach the outlet).  I also like the white color and white cord which is much less noticeable on my white counter."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Everything about this is worthy of 5 stars except that the back lit time is hard to read... Which is pretty key to having a clock! I have experimented with turning the backlight up (which makes for too much light if you like to sleep in the dark) and down, which makes the time impossible to read. Everything else is truly great."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Good reception, but the buttons are small and hard to figure out. Reception is good, but if you wear glasses and need to push the right button in the morning after the alarm goes off, you could get a bit confused. Otherwise, it seems to fit our needs."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I had to return the clock because the date wouldn't ser correctly.  Otherwise I was a nice clock.  If the date setting would have worked I'd have given it 4 stars."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I really like this digital clock radio.  I like it that you can have one alarm for the weekdays and one for the weekend.  Reception seems to be very good on AM and FM stations.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great, small profile, digital clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Not thrilled about the orange light... it is orange like in the picture.  Usually you can set the alarms, radio without reading the manual. This one you have to read how to do what you want to do."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Update on this radio. I loved all the features and it was dependable however it stopped working just under its second year of use. I was hoping it would last longer. Im going to repurchase and hope for more life from the next one."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: It's too easy to inadvertently hit the alarm and nap buttons when changing stations. This is not a good ergonomic design. The station buttons should not be in line with the clock functions. I find it impossible to set the year, date and day. No matter what I do it reverts to year 2043. Definitely some kind of defect. I don't use the alarm function at all. Nor do I care about years, months, days and dates, only the time. The volume knob looks analog but is really digital with discrete detents. Radio reception is good in my area."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Tried to contact store per their e-mail and they refused to assist me as they stated in their e-mail.  I would never purchase from Store123 - Amazon Market place again.  The directions are unclear on how to set the alarm to awake to my favorite radio station at 4:00 am.  The radio also had poor sound quality."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This radio has two alarm functions. A nice feature is that tuning is done in digital increments making finding a station extremely easy. There are five presets for AM and five for FM. It has delayed turn-off for when resting prior to going to sleep. Also a napping-timer that will wake one up after up to 2 hours. Volume is controlled by a analog dial. Reception is good. The manual is needed to set the alarm features or you may struggle."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Radio seems to operate just fine. The digital FM tuning was the key function I was looking for and it appears to work well here in Hawaii. The radio has the usual mix of alarm clock functions. I lowered the rating by one star reflecting the poor instructions that accompany the radio. Other reviewers have noted this, too. It is not obvious how to set up the various functions, the alarm icons are not described (a simple picture would have helped a lot), and the written instructions finally make sense after you figure out how to set things. We have the radio across the room from our bed and it is impossible to read the time display, but it would be fine if the radio was on a nightstand close to the bed."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: buttons a little hard to get used to but I bought it to  turn into a specific radio channel that I couldn't get with the tuner on my old radio."}

{"review":"This is a very positive review: Awesome clock radio. Set up an alarm for weekdays, never need to mess with it again. Just go to bed without fiddling with an alarm on my phone and wake up to the local radio station. Great sound quality. Convenient snooze button. Adjustable volume for alarms. Adjustable display brightness is brilliant. 3.5mm input if you want to play your own music.\n\nAlso, setting up an alarm on this is not hard. Just spend 10 minutes walking through the manual and then you'll never have to do it again.\n\nGreat clock. I don't really know how a clock can get much better than this one, unless it also brewed your coffee."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Nice alarm clock.  It just has a nice look and feel.  it has dual alarms, 5 presets and dim-able back-light.  The back-light color is more pleasing at 3:00am than other LED colors I've had in the past."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The radio is hopeless at picking up AM reception in my area - which is what I wanted it for as it had a headphone jack. I have put it back in the box and put it in a cupboard. It will never be used. Not worth the postage cost of sending it back from Australia to the US"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I had high hopes for this clock radio because it was one of the only radios that has a 3.5mm audio out port.  Unfortunately, this product was a disappointment from the start.  From the moment I plugged in the clock radio, the built in speaker made terrible hissing crackling noise."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I just got this sangean. Already the radio has stopped functioning. Lasted @1week. I'm not pleased with product & plan on returning it as quickly as I can. Not sure if I'd get another one."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Its ok but after a month or so unless you go back in and go thru the set up for an alarm you have set up for the clock radio it stops working."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was looking for a clock radio that actually had some sound(instead of a speaker in a tuna can like most clock radios) and held radio stations well, and this did not disappoint....no, its not a bose wave radio but neither is the price. don't care for the display though, it puts a yellow hue in the room(it is adjustable) and the icons are too small.....but this is on a nightstand- maybe it would be better in a bookcase headboard. I had no trouble programming right out of the box, don't know why other reviewers had trouble, I love the station preset feature, the humane wake system and nap feature..........if you are looking for a good sounding, reasonably priced clock radio loaded with features this is the one"}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This Sangean Clock Radio works correctly but is difficult to program.  Instead of having the buttons simply marked, on\/off, snooze, etc., there are just random symbols which aren't very easy to ascertain what they mean.  I bought two for my 18 and 11 year old daughters.  We all have to look at the instruction manual or spend three times as long as it should take to figure out the simple things like setting the time.  Once its et up, It's easy to remember the snooze and alarm set but other options are a struggle.  My middle daughter has a different alarm clock that has all the same options but is labeled properly and is simple to program."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I replaced a clock radio that could not receive the radio station that I wanted... We are in an area far away from the station so I went looking for a radio with better reception.  This radio worked and received the station clearly, exactly what I needed it to do.  One nice thing is that you have control over the brightness of the display although at the lower level there is not a lot of contrast between the numbers and the background.  All in all It is a good choice and the price is right.."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This device looks nice but I am returning it.  The instruction manual comes in 5 languages, English, French, Spanish, Dutch and German.  Whoever wrote the manual obviously does not have English as a first language. But what frustrated me the most is that it said, replace the batteries if you will not be using the unit for a long time.  What batteries?  There is no battery compartment, there are no batteries for the unit.  Further instructions say that the \"battery\" (singular this time) will retain the settings for about 10 minutes.  Ten minutes!?!  So, if your electricity is out for eleven or more minutes, the built-in battery backup is worthless.  Also, this device comes with an adapter, not a regular cord, so it will use up space on your wall outlet, preventing you from plugging in anything else.  Done so it could be used in different countries, no doubt; but inconvenient.  Oh how I wish there were just ONE American manufacturer who made quality clock radios in the USA, designed for use in the USA.  At any rate, this device goes back right away."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Most of the clock radios I have tried have one major shortcoming -- the display is too bright.  My nightstand is right by my bed, so the display is not much more than 16\" from my face.  I don't need the xenon projector bulbs that most clock radios seem to use.  If they have an adjustment, it is usually just a high\/low switch between atomic and nuclear settings.  This radio has an adjustable display brightness that is \"infinitely\" variable from off to full bright.\n\nThe second major plus to this radio is the reception, which is what Sangeans are know for.  We live in a condo, and the bed end of our bedroom is nested into a bunch of interior walls.  So, reception can be a bit of a problem.  My last radio (a Sony) just couldn't cut it, no matter which way I stretched out or coiled the antenna wire .  This radio is getting rock-solid reception, without even unwrapping the antenna wire.\n\nIf I have one nit to pick with the design of this unit, it is that the power button is also the alarm-off button.  That button is the same size and shape as every other button, and it can be hard to find it quickly when I am still mostly asleep.  But, all in all, this is a nice solid radio that works well."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: good quality clock radio with preset buttons.  controllable lighting on display.  a glowing on\/off button helps you find the control in the dark.  altogether a good value."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this a year and a half ago and after unplugging it to wipe it off (a lot of dirt get trapped in the top) I plugged it back in a little while after and the radio stopped working! Clock and light still work fine so I'm not sure what happened. Because it's not under a year since I bought it, the warranty has expired and when I called the company to have it repaired they told me it would cost $28 to repair + $8 to ship it, AND take 4  6 weeks. That's only a dollar less than the price Amazon is selling the new ones for, but I may end up having it repaired since, well, waste sucks.\n\nI am very disappointed because up until this point this has been a GREAT kitchen radio. I really only used it for listening to talk radio so I can't speak to it's sound performance playing music. I also enjoyed using the radio alarm clock function, worked like a charm. Ugh, so sad.\n\nWord to the wise, leave this thing unplugged for hours after you clean it to be safe!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I had previously purchased the portable Sangean radio which has an excellent sound but this is also brilliant.\nConsidering we live in the countryside, I can clearly get many stations.  Good products."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: AM reception is weak.  FM is loud and clear.  The volume control is digital.  The lowest setting (1) is too loud for strong stations.  The only way to decrease the volume level below 1 is to use plug in earphones with an in-line volume control.  The radio is FM stereo, but the stereo can only be heard with stereo earphones because the radio has only one speaker.  Overall, a pretty good radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio was a gift for my husband, whose requirements included: simple, small, AM\/FM signals, good sound quality. I did a lot of research and bought this radio. It has delivered on all accounts, especially the sound, which is impressively good, whether you're listening to NPR, rock or smooth jazz. We use it in the kitchen, where it doesn't take up a lot of counter space, and we can hear it just fine in the dining and living rooms without blaring it."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: It took a while to figure out how to set everything, and dim the light, but now it's doing exactly what we bought it for."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Compact, good sound, love the dual alarm. Has nice features. And you can really dim the light on it -- I used to put an old hat on my other clock radio b\/c it was like a stadium next to my head."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I live near Orlando and the best jazz radio station on the planet. It's just out of reach of my radios and getting it online just seems like a waste so I took a chance on this one to see if Sangean had the right stuff--and it does. This little box brings it 5X5. Some reviewers are disappointed with the sound but I like it. Frequency response is limited but within the limits it has that nice tight \"sony\" sound. Need more bass? Plug in powered speakers to the headfone jack. And it's cute and tells time. Nice."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This radio has very good sound for such a small radio.......... That said the rest is pretty bad !!  All the buttons which are lined up in a row are NOT very useful when waking or fumbling during the night because they are indistinguishable, one from the other.  The other BIG item is the display which is not readable except at full brightness.  When on full bright, it lights up the room, when dimmed it becomes unreadable......  I love Sangean radios, but this one is NOT for bedside alarm clock >>> it's gone back with me disappointed."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a great product.  I've had it long enough now to judge it and I'm so glad that I bought it.  I live in an area with poor reception,  It's picking up stations that I could only get on my car radio before.  Although it isn't stereo, the sound is much better than any clock radio that I've heard.  I thought the gradual sound increase on the alarm was silly when I read about it, but, it's actually kind of nice.  I wish the alarm shut off was a little more handy.  It's a little hard to find when your sleepy headed."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Overall, very pleased.  I like the small footprint and I love now having the pre-set buttons.  And the ONLY reason I upgraded to this clock radio from my current one was because it's one of the few that has the ear phone output (input?) AND the pre-sets for AM-FM.  Sound is good (wish it were stereo, however) and brings in distant stations without a problem.  Sets up very easily and I DO like the ease with which to set the sleep timer - I use this every night with a pair of lightweight earphones (wish there were a few more choices other than: 60, 45, 30 or 15 min.).  All the buttons are on the top and well placed - don't have to fumble and reach around to the side or back to initiate functions.  Front illumination on face is easily dimmed to your preferences and well-lit - easy to see at night and day."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This clock radio is exactly what I wanted.  Very easy to set alarms and the stations lock in and can be programmed like a car radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Bought this for my 10-yr old son. He needed an alarm clock and radio- he likes to listen to baseball games in bed at night. He didn't need bluetooth, cell phone or ipad docking station or anything like that. This has been perfect so far - it's well made, has good controls, and gets excellent radio reception."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Wish I hadn't bought this.\nPositives:  this clock radio has excellent radio reception and I like the ability to preset stations.  But the negatives: the display is too bright.  Why didn't they illuminate the numbers instead of the background? Illuminating the background produces way too much light.  If you dim the display the contrast goes way down and I can't read the time.  If the display is bright enough to read the numbers, it is way too bright for sleeping.  And setting the alarm is unnecessarily complicated.  And you can't just hit a button to turn the alarm set on or off, you have to go through the whole process again.  My old clunker is so much easier to use."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: It's difficult to find a decent AM\/FM clock radio nowadays. This one seems to work well. The volume for AM seems a bit lower than that of FM, but I rarely listen to AM anymore. The display dims down nicely and unlike other reviewers, I don't find it difficult to read the clock."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Good reception on both AM & FM bands. Sets up easily and alarms work well. Only minor complaint is volume isn't real strong but then again I'm hard of hearing."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love this radio.  I have it at my work, and I get a clear signal in my cube.  Very good quality for the price."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Reception is better than most but still substandard on rainy days-- I just can't get clear signal on AM high watt station. And I dislike the alarm set up, very confusing. I could have bought something cheaper, feh"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: perfect clock radio for guest room. I love that I can pre-program stations and the tuner does not drift! Rock solid. I also love the ability to dim the display and the amber color helps preserve night vision if a guest needs to get up during the night. I only with the volume control let me set the audio lower. The \"1\" setting is fine but I'd like a \"whisper\" setting for leaving the radio on all night. The white color is a nice change and does not look dusty as quickly."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This was to replace an alarm clock\/radio.  The radio is functional, but not a good as the one we have had previously. The old one was analog radio, and the reception become noisy, scratchy.  This radio has a little better reception, but seems the technology has not improved. The choice of alarm\/radio's is very limited.  It seems this needed device is disappearing from the market place."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: As this was a grift for a 8 year old, it is fine. But it is not a radio that an adult would want.  The time display is bad and the quality of the radio is poor."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was looking for a good work radio with fm\/am radio and a clock. This one came nicely packaged and the set up was very easy. The sound is great. I am very happy with it."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Sound is not what I would expect of Sangean, even at this price.  The worst thing, though, is that disabling the alarm, cancelling the setting, is so complicated and the directions so poorly written that neither my wife nor I could get it cancelled.  We finally removed it from the bedroom.\n\nNot user-friendly.  Bad choice."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: After about one month, the power pack on the electrical cord started to buzz and hum. Since it was still under warranty, I sent the bad power pack and $8 to Sangean for replacement. It took a couple of months to receive the replacement. The new power pack was DOA; probably from being damaged in the mail due to Sangean mailing it in a flimsy paper envelope. So, I contacted Sangean and they wanted another $8 for another cord replacement. In my mind, I thought it would be better to return the whole unit to Amazon, get a full refund and then re order the unit again from Amazon. The reason for wanting to reorder the same unit was because despite some major engineering flaws in this radio, this little radio has the best radio reception I have ever come across! I could pull in far away stations really well, and the sound was great! My plan didn't work very well on the return to Amazon. The first roadblock was that it was past the time that Amazon would accept a return on the item. But, when I told Amazon the story of the 3 month warranty return etc, Amazon let me return the unit for credit. Next problem here was that Amazon charged an $8 restocking fee!!!!! I am really not happy with this. Also, if this unit was restocked, the future buyer of this is in for a surprise, because the power unit is dead! If you are planning on buying this little clock radio here are some more negatives to think on. There are a lot of buttons on the top of the radio, but only the power on button is lit. This makes it hard to figure out what button to push at night. Also, the backlit display has  a dimmer and brightener knob, but it is on the underside of the unit and is hard to adjust. Plus, holding the unit up to dim or brighten the display invariably you will hit one of the top buttons. Here are the positive things about this unit: 1. Great radio reception. 2. Easy to understand set up. 3. good instruction manual. 3. Has all the sleep, and timer functions you would want on a radio....Had high hopes for this unit, but manufacturer really messed up on the warranty repair!!! Also really unhappy with Amazon's restocking fee."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Bought this to keep in the work office. Bright display and the keeping point is that it has a headphone jack for listening so not to distract other people. Also has audio in for plugging in your iPod, etc."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Pleased with this purchase. The sound is excellent for a small radio. Has some nice features, two separate alarms, both are adjustable for volume volume, both have tone or radio options. The lighted display has a full range of brightness choices and the time numerals are large and easy to read. There is additional info on the display showing which alarms are set and for which days of the week. Radio has a digital tuner and locks on the selected stations. There are buttons for your favorite stations. Only drawback is the buttons are small and the use of them is not intuitive. You will most likely need to refer to the manual. I did. This would not be a good choice for an person tends to by confused my technology. But I am very pleased with it and the price is extremely reasonable."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: Several radios I own are going to the church rummage sale.  I needed a radio with good tuning on the non-commercial portion of the radio dial, since most of what is on the commercial end is garbage.  The Sangean RCR-5 tunes to these close spaced station without any problem.  Setting the radio up was rather simple, even without reading the instructions.  I did read the instructions for further detail, but the setup was simple.  You can buy a cheaper radio, but if it doesn't pick up what you want to listen to, you're throwing your money away.  At least the church will make a few dollars on the ones I discarded."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Well pleased with sound quality, very clear voice and music reception -- No station drift ... However, do have a few specific negatives -- The LED window could be sized larger -- Being an octogenarian with diminished eyesight, I have problem viewing LED ... The sound volume control is not consistent on volume increase or volume decrease -- I have to firmly push volume control knob inward, then rotate before any noticeable volume change is effected ...  Furthermore, not being a 'young one' with formidable technical skills and lacking in technological adaptability, I found it quite confusing and difficult to set the time, the alarms, nap and other programs  ... Gave 4 star rating because I am impressed with concepts you were able to incorporate in a small package -- But -- This is not a clock radio for older people of my ilk.\n\nR. F. Bailey"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is the absolute BEST alarm clock I have ever owned.  First and foremost, the quality of the cabinet is phenomenal - it is heavier than other models I looked at during my research.  The buttons are all very clearly labeled and while some people may find the instructions on the dual alarms convoluted, if you take the time to read them, it is very easy to set this clock accurately.  I love having the dual alarm that can be set for the work week on the first and the second for whenever needed.  It would also work great for those couples who need to wake up at different times, as you can have both alarms set at once for different times (my husband and I tried this, as we awaken 4 hours apart, and it worked great - but this is MY clock! He can get his own!).  I get GREAT reception on the radio - both FM AND AM.  The amber-glow face was the biggest thing that drew me to this clock, as it has that \"retro\" feel to me that I love - and is dimmable, which is a plus, and gives me just enough light next to the bedside that if I have to get up, I am not tripping over anything, while being non-intrusive to sleep.  I am always more than willing to spend money for a durable, well-made product and this is one purchase I DO NOT regret making!  This clock is well worth it!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very nice radio with several unique features. It sounds better than any other clock radio that I have heard. It is small and attractive."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I received my Sangean RCR-58K Digital Am\/FM Clock radio, and within three months the digital tuner was not functioning correctly.  I had bought it because of the digital tuner, easy moving between AM for news and FM for talk radio while shaving.  In addition to the tuner issue, I had trouble with the clock:  The year would change to 1993, and I had to unplug the unit and wait a day or two before I could reset it. The last time the clock reset, I was no longer able to tune radio stations, and unfortunately, t"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Fantastic as a radio -- great reception.  Poor alarm functionality  --- cannot tell when looking at clock\/radio whether it's armed or not.  Display is dim.  Also all buttons and button location is too close and similar.  Just as easy to select \"nap\", \"sleep\" or station #6 by hitting adjacent button on top."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Pleasantly surprised, even though it took more than a month to be delivered.  Sangean makes a quality product at a reasonable price and this small clock\/radio was definitely worth the wait!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Finding a small AM\/FM radio that is NOT battery powered was a good trick.  This is it and I love it.  Perfect on my kitchen counter.  The only thing that would make it better would be digital tuning."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: the clock went bad shortly after i bought it ,when i called them directly they were not nice about it,so if u plan on buying this company think again"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I have quit using this clock radio after a month.  After spending a lot of time on Amazon finding a clock radio I went to Wal-Mart and bought one of the two that they had for sale where I could see and touch it.\n\nPro:  The radio worked ok; not all of them do.  It has good features if you can figure them out.  Mine did not adjust for daylight savings time although it knows the date\n\nCon:\nI found I really dislike the backlit display compared to illuminated LED's.  It puts out a lot of light in the bedroom.  The numbers are smaller than most clock radios.  This caused me to give up on it.\n\nThe radio was hard to setup even with the instructions.  The first step is to put the date in.  I had a very hard time getting the radio to store the date.  Then I moved on to the alarms which are a learning curve.  The first push is for Monday-Friday.  Nice, but I work four days a week.  I only want alarm, not radio.  I did not have a positive experience with the radio.  I keep thinking this may be a product of German engineering with an emphasis on engineering and not so much on a friendly customer interface.\n\nNow I have to do a sale on eBay.  This costs too much for an experiment to be discarded.  I should have paid closer attention to the reviews.  I also remember that this was one of the better review clock radios."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: i was looking for a clock radio with a good sound and a display that would be easy to read in my very sunny bathroom. So five stars for that. My only problem with this radio so far is that the buttons to set the alarm and change the time are not very intuitive. I never would have used the alarm button, but when DST happened, I had to change the time. Next thing you know the radio was going off at crazy times. Finally figured out how to turn the alarm settings off. So probably four stars for that. Otherwise an excellent purchase."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Difficult to set up, directions need review for clarity and missing items. Really need directions for changing settings. I do enjoy digital radio, audio clearer. The alarm has great sound. This is a new purchase of a clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I do not recommend as a bed side radio.  The buttons are not lit up and too small, only the power will have a light but will go out when turned on.  I have trashed out many times looking for the power or the presets.  Only to push the nap button, then 10 min later the nap alarm goes off.\nIt is now in the garage!"}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: The display light is so bright that I have to face it away from my bed and cover it up so it won't disrupt my sleep.\n\nSetting the alarm is over complicated.  I've had the clock for years and still have to look at the instructions when I change my alarm time. It's not very user friendly.\n\nExtra star because the radio has a good reception."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: A great looking and sounding radio for a very reasonable price.  Good performance at pulling in distant stations, particularly when connected to a good FM antenna, although the simple wire antenna that comes with it does a good job too.  Not the easiest to set up the first time or to set the alarm, but patience and practice yields results."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love how dim the display can be, it doesn't wake me up and it doesn't light up my room at night, which was my main reason for purchase.  It does not have the blue or red glow which is bad to have in your room at night assuming your goal is sleeping.  This has been working perfect.  I love the short height and small size, fits great on my night stand next to my night light.  Get this."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a great radio.  It is easy to operate with a great sound.  I am able to get stations I could not get before in the location (bathroom) I have it in.  Very few white ones are available with white cord.  It is nice to be able to program 10 stations.  It is perfect for my needs and so glad I discovered this to replace my old huge brown\/black clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great clock radio.  Small footprint and awesome alarm.  It starts out quietly and gets louder in steps until you turn it off.  Recommend it for antone."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It would be fine if I only wanted to listen to the radio but we needed an alarm.  I never could get the alarm set.  I'm sending it back."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Construction is pretty solid, but how the controls are supposed to work is not obvious.  You shouldn't have to go digging through a rather dense user's manual to figure out how to set an alarm clock!  This thing is more complicated than my new HDTV.  Also, the buttons are small and poorly arranged - frustrating when you're half asleep to find the Snooze button.  Would NOT recommend."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Excellent radio - but ergonomics poor. It's too easy to turn on the Nap feature - and there's no way you'll figure out how to turn it off without getting out the instructions.  Have two."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: It's great . . . I think. When I finish my electronics engineering degree I'll be able to set it up . . . maybe!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Decent radio reception, nice clock display, easy to set up and use.  The wall plug is quite chunky, almost didn't fit behind our cabinet.  Case is a bit cheap looking.  Otherwise fine."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I purchased this as a replacement for my ole Sangean clock radio which had started to pick up alot of static interferrence.  I love the new design.  It's size is st greatly reduced from my old one as to be unrecognizeable.  It is a very comfortable size for a bedside stand.  I also like the amber glow as opposed to the old green display.  Much easier on the eyes.  Most of the rest is very similar to the older Sangean.  I would give it 4 1\/2 stars if possible.  Not worthy of 5 stars because (1) there is NO battery backup in case of a power failure and (2) I find it much more user unfriendly to set the times for the dual alarms (althought the \"weekday only\" feature is a very nice addition).  All in all, I would not hesitate to recommend this clock radio to anyone."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I love everything about the alarm clock except the location of the button to turn the alarm off.  The snooze button is very wide and at the front so it's easy to hit.  If I want to finally turn the alarm off instead of hitting snooze again.. I have to fish around for the small button to the right, the second one back from the front while half asleep.  One nice feature is when I program the alarm for radio, it goes off very low volume and slowly ramps up to the level you preset.  The max volume level it ramps up to and the radio channel used for alarm are independent from the volume and channel used the last time I listened to the radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: UPDATE: I've had this radio for a while and it really is annoying how difficult it is to operate. Of course I read the manual and \"learned\" how to set the alarm, BUT there is nothing easy or intuitive about that whole process. And turning off the alarm is also NOT a simple thing to do. One of the big problems is that the entire row of operating buttons across the top - and there are NINE OF THEM - are identical in size and shape. Well, when you wake up still half-asleep in the morning and want to change something on the radio you can easily hit the wrong button, or not hold a button long enough to get the change you want.\n\nFor a long time I had a Sharper Image clock radio\/CD with many different features, and at first that too was a little complicated for me to figure out how to operate, but once I understood it, it became easy because there was a kind of logic to each step. When it \"died\" I would have been happy to replace it with a new one, but it was discontinued.\n\nFor this Sangean, on the other hand, there are no simple distinctions between various functions you have to set. I know Sangean products are dependable, and have excellent sound quality for radio reception, and after having looked at reviews of other clock radios on Amazon I really didn't see a decent alternative. So I'm sticking with the Sangean, but hoping they hire some engineers who can produce a much more user-friendly and intelligently designed clock radio!\n\n(Here is my original review, after having the radio a very short time: Very good radio, compact, but not the most-user friendly. It takes some time to figure out all the settings. I'm a fan of Sangean radios. Excellent sound quality."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Nice radio overall quality is good. The tuner is very good! receives stations  that with my old radio i had to play with the tuner to get just right and gets some stations that i couldn't get in my bed room with the old radio. The sound quality is very good with the FM and just good with the AM  cant figure that out since it only has the one speaker. It was simple to set up i did read the instructions . I really like having the station presets, for such a small radio i am happy."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Sound quality is poor even for a radio of this price.  Go to WalMart or Target where you can turn on the radio and listen to it first.  If I had I would have purchased something else."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This small clock radio has great sound.  I can get my favorite PBS station and also an AM station that plays golden oldies.  The radio that I replaced was larger but did not have the great reception that this one has.  It was easy to set up and is easy for me to turn on and off even in the dark.  I am very happy with it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I like the radio. For the price, it sounds good.  The reason I bought it was it had gotten good reviews and the price was ok."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: very nice clock, but i too had a hard time figuring out how the alarm worked, and setting the noise level of the alarm. i would do a practice test- because the first time i set it, it was too low and i slept through it. i found 21 to be just right. i wish the alarm was easier to set- it almost has too many options (weekly, just the weekend, once). but now that i've figured it out i am happy with it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent FM reception.  Handy features include a sleep button, a nap button where you can use the clock like a timer to awaken you at 15 minute intervals, dimmable display, a headphone jack so you can listen without disturbing your partner at night, an easy to adjust volume dial, and 10 station presets (5 for FM and 5 for AM)."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Works good.  The preset buttons let you program the stations you like to listen to.  From that point on you can simply press the program button.  When the alarm turns on the radio, it starts out soft and slowly go loud.  I really like that.\n\nIt has so many features, I haven't mastered all of them yet.  It has two alarms and each of them can be set for time and day of the week.  It can be every day or just week days."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Purchased a Third one (3 different locations) as there was a need for another one.  All work very well and pick up weak station just fine.  Love it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Radio is clear and has good selectivity for which we are pleased.  The wall wart power supply is noisy and for a bedroom radio is louder then we would like."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I  didn't like the features on this radio.  The tuning was completely foreign to me.  I was looking for a simple to operate clock radio with alarm.  Apparently, they are hard to find so I took a chance on this one.  It might be ideal for others but wasn't for me."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Very good sound for this radio. I like the fact you can set alarm for weekday and weekend. Plus when it awakes you by radio, it starts at low volume and then increases."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: There are some nice features of this radio that I like.  The backlighting is nice and the fact that it can be adjusted is a real nice feature.  The sound is good.  It does sound a little muffled, but it might be because it is sitting on a towel on the night stand which may cause the muffled sound.  The alarm is not very loud, but I have not played with it enough to see if it can be adjusted.  Overall, it is a nice clock radio and does wake me up with the radio feature.  It is a nice size and fits nicely on the night table."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: You can not see the clock when it is dark.  We followed the instructions to change the background lighting and the numbers still were not visiable.  We ended up returning this and buying a different brand which is working much better."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Love this little radio.  I do not hear the static on my favorite (NPR) FM station that had been such a problem with other radios.  This is perfect for my bedside because it is small, the display light dims to a low level that does not disturb sleep, and it is orange display light rather than blue so it is very unobtrusive.  Easy to set up.  Buttons are nice because you do not have to look for them in the dark like some now that are totally flat.  If I need another radio I would not hesitate to buy another one of these."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am pleased with my purchase. It does everything well and the sound is better than I expected from a small speaker. The back light can be adjusted so as not to be a problem for even the lite sleeper.  I would recommend it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I am pleased with clock and find the radio reception much better than my old Sony. However I found the clock numbers hard to read because of the background light. They need to be darker and separate from background dimmer. If not for this my rating would be higher."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Works well with good sound and reception.  I enjoy being able to preselect stations rather than spinning a dial to find them. I also like the gentle wake up feature for the alarm sound, pretty neat.  One minor complaint: setting the alarm seems needlessly complicated, just too many steps, although being able to set a standard Mon - Fri alarm and another for weekends is a neat feature.  I'd buy one again, just not crazy about the alarm setting process.  If you are absolutely helpless when it comes to tech things, this is probably not the clock radio for you, otherwise, thumbs up."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I wanted a clock radio with presets and both AM and FM bands. That turned out to be harder to find than one would think, and the Sangean fits the bill. But I wish the user interface was simpler. Too many of the buttons have context dependent meaning, and the fancy fade-in alarm is nice, but should not be the only option. I just want it to turn on the radio at a specific time and leave it on until I tell it to turn off."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Much better reception and overall sound quality than any Sony product. A little more expensive but well worth it. AM Radio reception is noticeably better than a large C Crane unit we bought that was billed as having superior reception... BUT.. This cost less  than half what the C Crane cost."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: best alarm clock I ever had and I'm nearing the big 60. Well worth the price and the gradually increasing alarm feature is great"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Was very surprised that such a little box could produce decent sound. Granted it is not stereo FM but for a bathroom radio I didn't need a complete 7 channel system. We use the countdown timer more than any function. Was also amazed that we could pull in any of the station we wanted with just the little wire running along the back of the counter."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The Sangean RCR-5 Digital AM\/FM Clock Radio was exactly what I was looking for at a price that is very affordable.  The radio takes up little space, the clock has a lighted face which is easy to read and the reception is excellent.  In just three words, I love it!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I've been looking for a basic AM FM clock radio for a while now.  The first one I ordered (a Sony cube) was defective so I had to return it.  The second one I tried was a  HMDX Jam Zzz and it was ONLY FM!!! (which I didn't realize). Who makes an only FM radio??? So I tried this one.  It seemed from the review that it would be good, but I was very disappointed.  First, the sound quality was pretty bad and second, the volume control only worked some of the time.  Also, the display is a backlit display, not an LCD, so it wasn't all that readable when I put it to the dimmer setting (so it wouldn't be so bright at night).  So, I had to return this one, too.  I ended up with a Timex, which is working fine.  My only complaint with it is that the display, even on the dim setting, is very bright.  Why is it so hard for them to get this right???  By the way, if you only want FM, the Jam Zzz has amazing sound quality."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I bought this hoping that since it was digital I could pick up more channnels at the office. Although I expected the building to block some stations the reception was not what I was looking for."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this about a  month ago. I was looking for a bedside radio that could pull in stations in an apartment building. My previous radio only received one station clearly.\nThis little radio is a good deal. I can adjust the wire antenna in my room and pull in a number of stations. The quality of the sound is good for such a small item, and the adjustable light for the clock works well. I like the alarm options--2 alarms, can set for days of the week  and\/or weekends only. Overall, I am very pleased with this little radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This review will not describe the alarm features  I merely wanted a radio for my bathroom with quality sound that didn't drift; and it had to be compact and relatively inexpensive.  After going through the ordeal of looking for the impossible I chose the Sangean RCR-5 Digital AM\/FM Clock Radio, but I kept my expectations at a minimum.  As I removed the clock radio from the well packed box, my first impression was quite positive simply by its heft.  As soon as I set it up, which was simple, and began using the controls, I knew this was a finely-crafted piece of workmanship.\n\nIt's compact size was perfect for the limited space I had reserved, and the flavescent display is clearer and easier to read in light than I had anticipated.  But the sound is amazing for such an inexpensive radio.  Believe it or not, compared to a $500 Bose, I'll take the Sangean!  In comparison, the Bose is muffled, whereas the sound quality of the Sangean is so pure I can hear the lyrics of nearly every song played  even the insipid lyrics *G*.  The fact that the Sangean RCR-5 Digital AM\/FM Clock Radio gets any reception in my house is remarkable because our other radios don't come in clearly, and we barely get cell service (two different things, but we live in some reception black hole).\n\nWhat I thought might likely be a return has pleasantly surprised me to the extent that I am going to purchase another for my husband.  He may be able to hook it up to his electronic drum set and use it for practice.  And if he can't, I'll have a great radio in my den to replace the nasty one that's in there now."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: good radio reception. the orange is so ugly and awful to look at. returning it. i am surprised more people don't comment on the ugly orange glow."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This clock radio was easy to set up and is able to tune in stations that I've found difficult to pin down on other radios. Great features, and amazing sound for such a tiny unit. My only complaint (and the reason that I didn't give it five stars) is that the buttons up top are all sort of the same--it's hard to distinguish one from the other in a way that makes it easy to work them by \"feel\", which is something that is really helpful on a radio one is likely to be fumbling with in the dark. Moving some of the \"setting\" buttons over onto the side or back of the unit, and giving the nap, snooze, and sleep timer buttons a distinctive shape\/and feel would make this pretty much the world's most perfect clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I just needed an inexpensive, little, basic radio for my desk with at least three presets for my favorite stations.  The sound is very good.  For my needs, it is perfect."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: its very tricky setting up but once you get it working its great. Hold onto the manual if you have daylight savings, etc.\nAlso the radio quality is very good"}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Nice build quality.  Good radio tuner.  But the backlight lights up the room at night, which is real problem if its on your nightstand.  Also, numbers were hard to read compared with standard red or green displays.  I think Sangean uses the backlight to differentiate itself, but in this case the backlight is functionally much worse than standard methods."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The clock radio is great, everything is well thought out and the sound is excellent except for one thing. When you try to see the time at night it is hard to read, apparently the display needs some light to make the display show up properly"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Now that my favorite conservative radio talk shows have been banished from FM to AM, I really thought this radio would be worthless.  But to my surprise, it works on AM just perfectly in the basement, with tons of computer equipment around.  I love it!!!!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I purchased this to replace my Sony clock radio as at night it was not pulling in and holding my favorite FM stations  Wow, the Sangean is terrific. I am receiving the FM loud and clear and, for a small radio, the speaker is quite good, both in volume and fidelity.  However, be clear, it is not a Bose.  One hint, I was even able to improve the reception by attaching the radios small wire antenna  to an old small FM antenna I had left over from something or other and placed it on my window sill above my night stand with the radio.  A hanger would probably do as well, if needed.  So, overall I am delighted with this really fine product."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: This is the most complicated alarm system I have ever delt with.  The alarm goes off in the middle of the night for no apparent reason.  Does not go off for the times I had it set for.  Total loss of confidence in the product."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: A very nice little package, and with the rare headphone jack option it suits our usage .  The display characters\/background  colour  does not work as well for our aging eyes as other devices we've had but all other functions especially tuning precision are very good.\nWe hope the little On\/ Off press button switch proves to be durable over time as it is the most worked control for us!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Rather user unfriendly in the setting mode.\nAlso Saturday and Sunday alarm settings are not separate so you have to wake up at the same time both days.\nThe time is hard to read both in the dark and daylight.\nStill good enough to keep and not return."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Just got this radio yesterday & wanted to add something I did not see in the reviews. While you can dim the display (knob underneath the radio), the time annoyingly shows the seconds counting up, so the display is constantly catching your eye with the changing numbers. The illustration doesn't show seconds, and I can't find any way to shut them off. The sound is also fairly cheap, as is the case...but it does have good reception and flexible alarms. Not the same quality as the clock radio I had which finally died, but it is the typical cheap Chinese quality of everything these days..."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: i purchased this clock radio to replace a lower quality one in terms of sound.  the reviews that said it has good clear sound are misleading.  i had the same amount of static as the cheaper radio.  insult to injury i had to spend $10.00 to return the unit.  not a happy camper at all."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: We mainly use ours for a radio and it has outstanding sound quality and reception (in our area), I never knew AM could sound this good. I think the time is super easy yo set. I didn't crack the manual for anything. The display is easily dimmed with a knob on the bottom. I'm not sure what others are complaining about."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent radio, I wanted this one because it has an in-jack for ear head phones-not too many radios have that feature now.very good sound, with no drifting once the stations are set, bright lite, small and compact..."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: This clock radio functions very well.  The sound quality is very good.  The alarm setting works well.  However,  we are unable to set the date and time.  After following the steps to set the date\/time, the changed settings are not saved.  The initial setting of year was 2013.  We tried to change the year to 2014 but that value is never saved.  There are no instructions for contacting the manufacturer about this problem."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Sangean has won my heart in the small radio department. I already have a small radio for the kitchen and one for the bathroom. This one, like the others, produces a clear sound and its controls are easy to use. It sits next to my bed, and where my previous two clock radios barely tuned in the classical music station here in Houston, this one has no problem bringing in a clear signal. Because it's small, don't expect big sound, but I think  you'll be pleased with the range of the sound it produces. I love it and recommend it without qualification."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I own both this model and the Sangean K-200 (and this review is cross-posted). The K-200 has superior sound quality and a smaller footprint on a bedside table, but this model is better in nearly every other way that's important to me; it's so much better that the K-200 got demoted to our office\/sewing room and I now use this one as my daily alarm clock and go-to radio. Here's my take on why the RCR-5 is much easier to use...\n(1) Physical raised buttons for on & off and preset-changes. The RCR-5's buttons are easy to feel in the dark and work great. The K-200 has those flush under-the-skin membrane buttons and they do NOT work well; to the point that I have to press the on & off button several times to get it to work. So frustrating, especially when trying to turn off an alarm quickly -- I just gave up on snoozing it entirely.\n(2) Amber backlit display. This is SO critical for a good night's sleep if this alarm clock is going in your bedroom. Blue light triggers the \"awake time\" chemicals in our brains and amber light triggers the \"sleepytime\" ones; I found the K-200's blue glow to be difficult to fall asleep next to. I have a much easier time falling asleep with the RCR-5's amber light by my bed instead.\n(3) Weekday alarm. Both Sangean models offer this awesome feature (set an alarm to ring at the same time only on weekdays), but the RCR-5 is much easier to set. The K-200 makes you use the tuning dial to set the alarms (turn, then push to set), and it's hard to advance to the next thing without throwing your current setting off with an accidental twist of the dial as you push.\n(4) Fade-in alarm. Love this feature, both for the easy wake-up for myself and because it makes it easier for me to snooze or turn off the alarm before waking my husband earlier than necessary. RCR-5 has it, K-200 does not.\n(5) Volume set for alarms. One of the things you can set per alarm on the RCR-5 is the volume it will turn on to -- this is FABULOUS!! With the K-200, you have to physically turn the volume knob to the level you want the radio to turn on to in the morning; this is a pain if you also listen to the radio at a louder volume during the day. Or if you have a toddler...see below...\n(6) Volume control is a wheel on the side of the RCR-5, not a big glowy dial on the front (as it is on the K-200). This is particularly important if you have a toddler in the house! With the K-200, my daughter would wander by and randomly crank the volume all the way up while the unit was off, just to play with the big fun dial...so the next time I turned it on, BLASTING SOUND! Ouch. I finally learned to turn down the volume before turning the K-200 on, but it was a hard-won lesson. The much more subtlety-placed wheel on the RCR-5 doesn't look like a shiny toy, so she hasn't messed with it yet. Hooray.\nAll in all, the RCR-5 has the best functions & features of any clock radio I've ever had. I wish it had the nicer sound of the K-200, but the RCR-5 just works better for me in every other way."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Alarm features work well.  However, I had to cement a felt dot in front of the \"nap\" button so that my wife would not accidently mistake it in the dark for a station preset button.  It would have been nice if the AM loop-stick antenna could be rotated w\/o rotating the radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent sound. Straight forward to set up. Small, similarly shaped buttons are hard to differentiate by touch. Small footprint is great, adjustable brightness is useful."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Compact; okay sound; easy settings.  I wouldn't rave about any features on this, but it's a good solid product that does what it sets out to do, with minimal fuss and at a reasonable price.  I use it in the laundry room so I can't judge it as an alarm clock, but it does dim itself very nicely so I imagine it's easy to live with from that standpoint."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This is a good product. The alarm feature is excellent. The overall build quality of the case is cheap. The audio quality is just OK. I am comparing this to the Boston acoustics clock radio that I have which is superior in every way. Unfortunately, Boston Acoustics no longer makes clock radios."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This was a surprise gift for my wife - she loves it.\nThe display is very readable and all her stations have great reception.\nI programmed the stations for her and she has easily master how to operate the radio including the sleep timer.\nWe have not used the alarms function yet. When you are retired you rarely needed an alarm."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Happy to find this radio. It's difficult to find a radio with a headphone jack nowadays. I use it with a pillow speaker. The only problem is the digital light is very bright. Wish it had a dimmer. I covered the front with a piece of dark window tinting film. That did the trick."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I just got this and set it up. The controls are really intuitive, and the sound from this thing is much better than I expected!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Sounds wonderful for such a small radio. Replaces my old workhorse that finally gave up after 20+ years.  I don't like that you have to go through hoops in setting...it sequences as opposed to being able to flip a switch and do just one setting.  Other than that, thus far it works.  I like the low volume alarm getting louder as it doesn't jar you awake.  If they could make setting simpler (and the on-off button a bit larger to differentiate it from the other) it would be 5 stars."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Good radio and, the instructions aren't as difficult as some make out. The digital tuner does well in our neck of the woods.  Our previous dial-modulated clock radio was challenging to say the least.  Only drawback to this unit that we've encountered is that we'd like to be able to increase the snooze time to something beyond 5 minutes.  I guess we need to get away from that snooze game that a lot of us like to play. ;)  All in all a good choice."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: Clock had to be returned because it was so complicated to set I almost my mind trying to set the time`-date -month and year!!\nDon't purchase unless you are gifted in electronics!!!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I needed a radio with an ear jack for my bedroom ( a feature which is becoming increasingly hard to find).  I needed a radio with a sleep timer.  This radio filled both needs, with the added ability of dimming the light at night. I'm very pleased with it, even thought about buying another for that time down the road when I'll need another radio for my bedroom. . ."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great product.  Looks and feels like a quality clock radio.  Despite what some other reviews say, it's easy to setup and change features.  Took 15 minutes to browse the manual, unpack and plug in, then set the date\/time and 5 FM presets and both alarms.  I use alarm 1 for the weekdays and alarm 2 for the weekend.  The manual isn't always the best (English is not the writer's first language) but just a little common sense makes setting up or adjusting this product no problem at all.  And the sound is the best I've ever had from a clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very easy to operate and the sound from the radio are rich and full. A bit more expensive that the typical clock radio but I purchased it for the reception and sound of the radio and I wasn't disappointed."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent clock and excellent features.  However the amber background makes it impossible to read the time from a distance, but sitting on the nightstand next to the bed, it can be read quite easily.  Reception is great especially with the light off."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great looking radio - works great with my soundbar....very clear FM!\n\nTake note voltage of the adaptor is 110V.  Odd that it isn't an adaptor with auto-switching voltage."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I'm very happy with the clock radio. Good sound, lots of options.\nSetting the alarm could be made a bit easier, it just takes a while to learn the steps."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Okay radio.  Poor sound quality.  Clock light is very bright but when turned down to a lower level of brightness you can not read the time..  Finish is glossy which leaves finger prints on radio when pressing buttons.  Like the fixed radio stations but disappointed in overall quality of radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This was a really nice clock radio, I liked so many of the features and the quality of the manufacturing was noticeable.  But ultimately, I had to return it for a couple of reasons:\n1.  The display was just too bright for me, although you can adjust it, because it's backlit you have to turn it up so high in order to see the numbers that it was like a night-light in the room at night.\n2.  The sound quality of the radio was badly muffled.\n3.  The Snooze was only 5 minutes, and really doesn't allow you to get a satisfying extra bit of time, my last clock was 9 minutes.  4.  When the radio goes off in the morning, it only stays on for about 30 minutes, I may have missed that setting, but it just isn't long enough for me to get ready while listening to the radio.\n5.  Operation was not intuitive, I eventually figured things out, but using for two weeks, I still didn't feel like I understood how to use it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a very nice alarm radio for the price, Its easy to set, has multiple day options and sounds fine for a small radio.  The display is easily customized.  But a 10 minute battery backup doesn't make any practical sense. I'm keeping it for use in a place that doesn't require alarms being backed up.  A complaint is a gift."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This radio\/alarm clock believes the year is  2013 and will not let me change it to 2014, no matter how many times I try. As a result, the days are always off and I cannot set the alarm using the \"Monday through Friday\" option because it will go off on Tuesday through Saturday. That is, if it goes off at all, which it sometimes doesn't. Then I have to rely on my dog to wake me up. She is very reliable about doing so, but her times are a little erratic. As a result this alternative  does not ensure that I get to school on time to teach my classes. I really don't like this alarm clock."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I returned it. The clock light is so bright that it was like having a lamp on next to the bed. The sound is very poor and the setting of the time and alarms very difficult!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: As the title states, this is the PERFECT alarm clock!\n\nThis alarm clock takes care of the simple thing that all other manufacturers seem to ignore. My major grip, but I could overlook it with the soft alarm function, is that the minimum volume level is 3, why?! I can fix that easily blocking the speaker (shouldn't have to) and the other features outweigh this loss heavily. The only other feedback I would have is it would be nice to have \"nature\" sounds - only because I got used to that on my last one and it beats radio commercials first thing in the morning.\n\nWhat makes this perfect? I have been plagued with trying to add tint to displays that have been too bright (ultimately turning them off so I could actually sleep, having to use my cell phone to check the time at night). I also find myself trying to make the sound softer, I don't know why people want to make alarm clocks that put on a concert. I am a light sleeper, I don't need that. I could go on...\n\nDimming - I was so close to wanting to \"design\" my own alarm clock, modifying something existing (thinking I could market it since this target is always missed). The dimming feature on this is absolutely amazing for something so simple. Want full brightness? Turn the dial (potentiometer) all the way up? Want it dim? Limitless adjustability to zero backlight. PERFECTION!\n\nAlarm feature - set weekday, weekend, one time, etc. Perfect options, something I have missed on other alarm clock feature lists in the past leading to a return.\n\nAlarm sound - soft wake feature is great, but you also set the alarm volume with the alarm. I was afraid with the volume control on the side (digital control so it is not another potentiometer) could get bumped, but it is actually fixed to the alarm setting. Another great feature.\n\nTurning the alarm off - how many alarm clock require you to turn the light on to find the off button? Too many. There is a lit power button on the top right that disables the alarm when you want to turn it off. At first I thought this was another great feature, however, when the alarm is on this is not lit. I don't understand why. Worst case you could snooze then hit this.\n\nSetup is a breeze, never cracked the manual other than to see how to disable the alarm.\n\nFor such a simple product, many manufacturers screw this up miserably. This is, hands down, the BEST alarm clock I have ever had. The details were well thought out. You will not be disappointed with this alarm clock! I read many reviews where people are just as weird as I about alarm clocks, I wish I could forward them to them all.\n\nNow to try out the other (less important to me) features..."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Easy to follow instructions display dimmer is on the bottom only I wish was snooze was 9 or 10 minutes instead of 5. Very good reception and really like the human waking system"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent radio; I only use it for the FM Radio, not for alarms, etc.  I live away from any large city and have had difficulty with reception.  However this little radio is great, works as advertised, good reception, easy to pre-set the digital radio stations, etc.  I would recommend it."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: it's about as good as such things get in this price range.  the big advantage is the digital tuner, which is more stable than the continuous knob tuners more common in competitive radios.  the sound is adequate, not great but ok compared to similar radios.\nthe downside is the usual over-complexity & non-intuitive nature of the settings.  you need to keep the manual handy for the simplest task.  and the date setting doesn't work on my radio (but i do not need to use a radio as a calendar). unfortunately this is a widespread disease."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The clock\/radio deserves 5 stars for performance, time visiblility and compact appearance.  So, why haven't I rated it 5 stars?  Tomorrow I have to reset the time for standard time.  There are several - I'm not counting - steps to take for changing the clock.  I shouldn't complain about a task that is completed only twice a year or if there is an extended power outage.\n\nThe instruction manual is info deficient.  There is no key for some of the display symbols (choice of alarms). I'm still somewhat confused with some of the functions and am learning its useage on an ongoing basis. An example:  \"After the time is under setting, the setting won't be cancelled even you don't press any button for more than 10 seconds.\"\n\nOverall, I'm pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a clock\/radio with a soothing alarm."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Best radio for waking because of the \"humane\" system (brightness and volume increase slowly from a \"whisper\" level to loud). Very reliable. However, the yellow LCD display is very difficult to see from a distance (not enough contrast). A red LED display would be much better  (blue or green would be easy to read as well but these shorter wavelengths interfere with melatonin production). Love the simple shape and style (hate radios that have trendy, goofy shapes). Should have a battery backup built in but this can be added externally."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Read the other reviews, purchased this based on the high ratings and I agree.  Programmed alarm without reading manual.  My highest praise for ease of use.  Tone quality is decent.  ONE big complaint.  Anyone buying a plain old clock radio without Bluetooth and\/or iPod dock (pretty much all the local stores have) is probably like me, older than dirt.  Would it have been so hard to print bigger labels?  Even with my reading glasses I had to struggle to read\/interpret symbols.  Fortunately, once it's programmed, you really don't have to read the labels again."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Just what I was looking for. I like the dual alarm feature that you can set for different days. Easy to set up. I especially like that you can completely dim the light so it doesn't keep you up at night."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Impressive.  Reception was excellent for stations that are typically hard to get.  Instructions were clear.  Setting alarm could be initially confusing given the functionality of the clock; many choices and options result in a complicated set up, but easily learned.  Better separation and physical distinction among buttons would keep from accidentally hitting the wrong button\/function.  Overall, extremely pleased, so far."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I absolutely love this digital radio.  The Christian station I listen to here where I live will only pick up a digital signal.  The signal is clear and the clock is wonderful!  I would recommend this digtial radio to everyone!  I have been looking for this radio for a few years now and am so glad I finally found it!!!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Nice radio with very good reception, even AM. On\/off ...just press button. Easy. Have not used alarm...bought as a bathroom radio.  Only complaint is you can't adjust tone.  Could use a little treble on  FM band."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The music does not get loud enough to wake me up in the morning. I have left it on for close to half hour and it is still very low."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Reasonable price for a radio of this type, however the Sangean has a few serious shortcomings. For starters the display is hard to read except when it is set up to almost maximum brightness, however then it is like a nightlite in a dark bedroom, so a dimmer setting is a must, and then it is hard to read. The alarms are complex to set up. It took me half an hour to get there. Finally the sound is kind of at the base end of the spectrum. I was OK with this as my high frequency hearing is not great, however I found it sounding distorted at low volume making talk difficult to understand, especially  deeper male voices. I hoped to upgrade it for one with larger speakers, but the seller told me I had to return it unopened and within 10 days. Unfortunately they told me this one after I tried it. So both from the point of view of quality and service (BidDeal is the seller) I cannot recommend either. Sorry."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio met my expectations and needs with one exception.  One cannot change the volume level when the radio is off.  So if I want to lower the volume before turning it on late at night, turning the volume wheel will not change the level from where it was set the last time the radio was playing.  It is only possible to adjust the volume after the radio is powered on.\nOtherwise it is fine for my needs: compact size, powerful enough speaker on top is easy to hear (as long as you don't put anything on top of it), reception is fine, several presets available, sleep mode, alarm - all satisfactory."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was looking for a clock radio, didn't really care about the alarm features (though this one has two).  This clock radio turned out to be exactly what I wanted.  I wanted preset buttons (this has 5).  I wanted AM and FM bands (this clock radio has them).  The presets are programmable as you would expect (push and hold and the preset remembers the station).  The presets access the stations as you would expect (push the button, you're there).  Good reception, both AM and FM.  The unit has a heavy, solid feel to it.  Extremely easy to set up.  It would be nice if it had battery backup, but considering all the other nice features it offers, I'd just as soon hook up a DieHard to maintain the memory!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Nice clock. I primarily purchased for the rare feature of an earphone jack. A little less intuitive for alarm setting than expected. I was a little worried since it was a less known brand, but works well so far. Dimmer on background light is nice."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: after trying and returning several other clock radios, we decided that this one came closest to the features we were looking for in a clock radio. i really like the feature of being able to sent up an alarm to only go off during the week so that it is set it and basically forget it. it is by far the easiest one to program of the several that we had tried. it has the feature of the alarm starting soft and then building up, and unlike several others that we tried with that feature, you could set the limit of the volume that would be eventually reached by the alarm. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is that the sound quality of the radio portion is not very good in my opinion. my old clock radio that i had for over 25 years had a better sound quality than this one but i guess you can't have everything."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: This is a nice little radio. Very good sound quality for the price.  However, it is ridiculously difficult to change from FM to AM.  Decided to pre-select only FM stations and disregard capability to listen to AM on this unit."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I wanted a digital tuner, I listen to some weak-signaled stations in my area and my old clock radio with an analog tuner could not pick them up.  I also like the \"humane\" alarm, starts low enough for you to hear but not so loud you practically soil yourself in the morning."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Some quick notes on things that may not be obvious:\n\n1.  Unit is much smaller than it appears in the pictures.  Display is large and bright and easy to read, though.\n2.  The alarms have lots of control.  You can set it for only certain days (weekdays, weekends, every day), you also set the radio station and volume level as part of the alarm, so it can be something different than what you were last listening to.\n3.  On the negative side, setting alarms is rather complicated, and it's not obvious how to temporarily disable an alarm for one day (say, if you wake up early and don't want it to go off and wake up your spouse\/partner).\n4.  Radio reception for me was fine.  The NPR pledge drive came in loud and clear.  Voices sound much better than on my 10 year old Sony clock radio.  But it is a clock radio, not a component stereo system."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Difficult to set and reset.  Have to keep instruction book handy.  Backup for power outages is not very long and backlight is bright, not good for those who like it dark for sleeping.  The only redeeming features are that the time is very easy to read and the alarm comes on quietly and can be turned off before it gets loud."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: This radio was ok for the first few years but most of the alarm and radio station buttons started malfunctioning after 5ish years.  Pretty unfortunate for an expensive clock."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Looed for a long time to find this digital baby but worth all the time it took to find it.  Use it only as a kitchen radio. Glad I looked until I found this one!!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Perfect clock for my bedroom only the backlighting of it is not perfect for me. The light is very bright but as you dim it (thank goodness you are able to do this) the numbers become a bit harder to read. I love it and will learn to live with it. I only use it as a clock so can't speak to its other functions."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Radio is much to complicated, I have not been able to get the time to work, the alarm wants to go off every day, the sound quality is not good.  You could get better performance out of a lot cheaper clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am very pleased with the sound quality of this unit. They actually put a good quality speaker in there, and that's exactly what I was looking for. Decent sound without taking up too much space on the night stand. I'm not thrilled with the display, but it works fine. There is a knob on the bottom of the unit that allows you to adjust the brightness of the LCD backlight to make it as dim or as bright as you would like. I prefer the old-fashioned LED displays, personally, but it's hard to find those these days, especially combined with good sound. So, I have no regrets about buying this unit."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I really looked for along time to replace my clock radio. This is perfect. I love the feature where I can plug in earphone and have my music turn off automatically after I have drifted off to sleep. If you want to use it for an alarm clock you have to unplug the earphones. Quality and size are exactly right. Dimmer makes sure light is not disturbing."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This has many hard to find features, audio out and sleep timer for radio, and a nap feature that is really easy to use. This is the best clock radio I've ever had."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: What a great little radio. It gets wonderful reception and that fact that we can preset the stations is a plus. I would highly recommend it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I purchased this radio primarily as an alarm clock and a digital tuner.  On both these counts the radio performs very well.  The alarm is set for radio and the music gently increases in amplitude until it reaches its set volume (nice).  The tuner is excellent and does not drift like analog tuners (which I had before). (Most alarm radio tuners are analog unless they state digital tuner.) There is no static with this digital tuner.  The sound is very crisp and clear.\n\nSome downsides.  (1) The lighted dial is bright.  Since my bed is below the clock, this does not bother me.  On the other hand, if you are not level to the clock, you cannot read the time. (2) It takes some time to get used to the navigation features including turning the alarm setting on or off.  Instructions are not great, -adequate.\n\nIf this clock had an adjustable lighted screen, it would get another 1-2 stars."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Sound quality is great, much better than any other radio or stereo system I've had.  It's a small unit (about 6 inches wide), fits on a nightstand.  Numbers are small and backlit- Can't see the time from across the room.  Snooze is only 5 minutes, and the controls to reset the alarm are difficult to figure out in the dark."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: one thing no one mentions is it has very good fm reception with only that little built in fm antenna, was able to place it in prime real estate in my bedroom where only the strong survive. was very amaze it could pull in very hard to get classical station where so many others failed, def. a great buy, pretty good sound also"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Nice radio lots of features. My problem with it is the selection of radio or beeper. I wanted the radio sound for wake up but I get the beeper sound. I think I got it right maybe 4 times out of 60 tries with careful following of the sequence. I tried using the < and > on the bar key and select and also without <\/> and select so its been mostly a miss :( Still a mystery to this day. And that beeper sound, my brain has recorded and I hear it over and over in my head all day long, can't get it out."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a very good little clock radio.  The feature set is excellent and the radio pulls in distant signals well.  The only drawbacks are that the display is hard to read in total darkness, and the sound is a little thin due to the fact that it has just a single 3\" speaker (or thereabouts).  All that said, this is an excellent value; this unit is clearly superior to all others in this price range."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I was looking for a clock radio that was able to get good radio reception. This Sangean does that very well. I also liked the small size so it doesn't take up much room on my nightstand. It seems to be well made, also.\n\nBut there were two things I did not like about it so I returned it.\n\nI did not like the display with dark numbers on a bright gold background. The background is adjustable but when I made it dim enough to not bother me at night, it was very difficult to read the time. I much prefer bright numbers on a black background.\n\nAlso, it took me several tries to figure out how to set it to wake me to radio instead of alarm. The display icons are very tiny and a bit confusing since the instruction book did not describe that the \"bell\" was for alarm and the \"megaphone-looking-thingy\" was for radio.\nI tried it out for several days before deciding this is just not right for me."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It's great! It is well made, like the Sangean shower radio that I also have. You can turn the display illumination all the way off, a feature that I like since I'm sensitive to light at night. For a small clock radio the sound is quite acceptable, better than other small radios that I've had. The buttons and switches are better than the usual junk quality you find in small radios.  It allows you to set each of the two alarms to apply to all 7 days, or just the weekends, or just M-F. This means that I can set the alarm and forget it. No longer will I be awakened Saturday morning because I forgot to turn off the alarm Friday night. The radio alarm volume control is programmed separately from the normal listening volume (on a per alarm basis), another user friendly feature.  It really seems to be a nicely engineered product.\n\n6\/6\/2017: And it still is working perfectly!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I've been looking for a clock radio like this for a while - surprised that it took so long, but it seems that there are a lot of ones out there but none were what I was looking for. I wanted a basic black radio with a screen that could be readable but not too bright. The screen brightness is adjustable. I have it set to wake me up to NPR each morning - which doesn't always work because I sometimes stay in bed to listen to the news story:). A cool feature is that the volume starts out low and gradually gets louder so you don' t have to worry about being startled out of sleep."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: My 81-year-old father-in-law began complaining that his 25 year old analog AM\/FM clock radio was no longer picking up his favorite local country music station that he needs to listen to all night while sleeping.  He asked me to help him find something newer.  I read the reviews about this radio on Amazon and decided to give it a try.\n\nThe radio easily picks up his FM radio station now, along with many others he could not receive on his previous clock radio.  Plus this one is simple to use for changing stations and setting up pre-sets.  (It has lots of other nice features, but my father-in-law won't try to use any of them; as long as he can hear his country music all night while sleep, he's happy.)\n\nI like the appearance of the display, too.  (The only negative is that the display brightness control is on the bottom of the radio; how stupid is that?)  I also like that it has an external FM antenna that is not incorporated into the power cord.\n\nOverall, I believe this is a good quality clock radio at an affordable price."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love these radios, this is my third one.  First off, this is a small unit best for personal listening near your chair or on a nightstand.  Don't expect room filling sound.  But at reasonable volume levels the sound is exactly the way I like it, articulate and clear.  Best of all, this radio is not grossly bass heavy like the Tivoli Audio and the Bose.  Once you become familiar with the controls and settings they are easy to set.  The first one I bought  has been running continuously out in the garage for about ten years now so they seem to be reliable.\n\nI may just be lucky, but I get all of my favorite AM and FM stations very well.  Experiment with the location of the FM antenna wire.  And with the AM reception it helps if there are no other wall warts or AC\/DC transformers on the same 110 volt circuit.  I have my main music system and other bedroom devices on a surge protector with an on\/off switch.  So on those occasions when I listen to AM, like sporting events,  I just click off the surge protector and this cleans up the AM reception on the little radio.\n\nThis is my first one in black and it is certainly very stylish.  But the white one doesn't show the dust and cat hair as much.  Just something to consider.\n\nUPDATE:  I just received another one of these radios for use by the pool.  The AM stations were mostly static and I could only get two FM stations at all.  I plugged it into an outlet in the house and it worked perfectly.  The problem, warts......wall warts.  If you are having reception problems it could be because you have other AC\/DC transformers (wall warts) on the same circuit as the radio.  Try the radio on a different circuit and see what happens."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Bought this alarm clock through Amazon a year ago and still love it! I needed a good alarm clock because my cell phone just wasn't cutting it but was not enthused by any of the alarms at Walmart, Target, etc. They either looked ok but had no features (like dual alarms, AUX input, etc) or, if they did have those features, they were ugly as hell -giant ridiculous looking things with way too many buttons and a cluttered display. So I started checking them out on here.. I was becoming discouraged as it seemed that most of the alarms with features that also looked nice were waaay expensive ..until I found this one. I loved that it was sleek, simple (aesthetically), and had everything I needed.\nIt's been a year now and I still love this alarm clock! When I tidy up the bedroom and make the bed, I still look over at it and think, \"damn, that's a nice looking alarm clock.\" :)\n\nPros:\n-Looks great\n-All of the necessary features (for me anyway!)\n-The amber color display (its so pleasant)\n\nCons:\n-I had to change the time for one of the alarms a few months ago and couldn't, for the life of me, remember\/figure out how to change it.. I had to pull the manual back out. So I guess it may not be the most intuitive programming. Or, most likely, I'm just getting old.\nI honestly can't think of any other negatives for this thing!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Love this radio. Signal is strong and has a crisp sound. Alarm goes off softly at first and then gradually gets louder. I'm very happy with this purchase. Well worth the money."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The unit has the outstanding sound That I was expecting. I am having difficulty changing the settings on the alarm system.  I will not give up."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Took some learning to sort out the control buttons\/features, but keeps the stations tuned very well (one distant station always seemed to fade out half the time on my old\/analog clock radio).  Worth the price!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Sound is okay.  Operation is not user friendly.  Tried using in the bedroom but buttons are not all logical.  Has been relegated to the garage."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I was looking for a radio with and earphone jack and this  was the one!\nNow I feel like a jerk should have read more.\nI leave in the northeast, during the winter months we loose our power frequently for periods of one to four hours.\nThere is NO Battery Backup!!!!!\nWhy the hell would a company make a clock radio with an alarm and NO BATTERY BACKUP.\nThis purchase was a Huge Mistake for me."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: PRO:\nGood volume on the radio\nStations come in nice.\nLove the buzzer to wake you up.  Starts out nice and quiet, gets louder and louder.  Eases you awake instead of jolting\n  you.  Very effective (believe it or not) and also a nice (r) way to wake up\nTwo alarm times\nCan be set to standard or military format\nCan show the year, month, and day\n\nCon:\nNo seek\/scan button.  Have to go through everything individually\nOnly 5 memory buttons\nCOMPLICATED!!! Will raise your blood pressure just trying to set this thing.  Even once you get the hang of it.\nTook me 3 days just to program the time, and another person to tell me how to set the alarm.  Not good for some one who doesn't know their way around electronics or isn't patient.  Once you get it working, it's great."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Love everything about this clock radio except it doesn't have a battery back up. Living in the northeast, with regular power outages, I have to reset it by hand each time. Also, have to have a back up alarm in inclement weather."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a GREAT-NEWS-O-GRAM!!\n\nI ordered an RCR-5 after doing an amazing amount of research (other competing products, etc.), still\nnot completely sure that I'd get the NO FRILLS, sleep-timer, head-phone jack, good reception, presets\nproduct I was after.................\n\nI received it, and have used it for a couple weeks........she's a WONDERFUL value......EXACTLY what\nI wanted.......and Sangean the ONLY team that brings such an animal to market.  I have no idea yet about\nthe durability over time.......some consumer comments about buttons that stop working....who knows what\nthe future will bring?........but it SEEMS solid enough, and at this price, even if  by low-percentage chance\nI got a lemon.......I'd probably go right back out and buy ANOTHER ONE!\n\nHere's what I LIKE:  the no-frills basic functions mentioned above\n  the shiny-smooth plastic finish (I got white)\n  the small size and clean lines, easy to handle\n  the simple controls\n  the sound quality, both AM and FM come in clearly and not tinny, in a\n  major metro area\n  and AMAZON, as usual under-promised and OVER-DELIVERED, processing and delivery were flawless and EARLY!\n\nHere's what IRRITATES:\n  the numerals and face (black against back-lit orange)\n\nSangean was flirting with PERFECTION, but just had to crap it up with this rinky-dink system!!\nColor me disappointed..........IF the numerals were LCD or LED in blue with a darker background,\nthe unit would be easier to read, without any complaint of too much light at night, and it would look\nalot sexier......I would have bought another unit immediately for the other side of the bed\nif this were the design, but as it is, I may wait for a \"new and improved\" thing.\n\nOverall, THIS IS A WINNER......Sangean ought to be PROUD of their product......I'm sure they've brought happiness\n  and enjoyment to multitudes!......reminds me of the way Samsung dominates TV."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Good reception. Quick set up.  Reasonable tone quality. MOST IMPORTANT: It's easy to switch stations; now I no longer have to endure listening to endless\/obnoxious\/fact-defying commercials!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is the second of these that I've bought. Very good, clear sound; I really like being able to use the preset buttons instead of hunting for stations with a dial tuner or having to scan.\nThese were very easy to set up and they are easy to use. This is a great product at a good price."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love this clock radio.  Digital tuner works great.  We live pretty far out from major cities with radio stations.  Clock radios that we've had in the past haven't picked up the station we want (NPR).  But this one has no problems.  It has 2 different alarms to set.  You can even set each alarm for different stations.  It's easy to set and re-set.  The only drawback is the display.  With the lit background and black numbers it can be hard to see at night, half asleep, with glasses off."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Looks nice but you can't see the numbers at night.  The light on the clock washed the numbers out and you just can't see it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Battery backup is only 10 minutes. So if you have an important appointment in the morning, you should likely set your phone or alarm that has a real battery that can last for a longer time , should you have a power outage. This is the main drawback of this unit, the battery is built in so you can't do a thing about the short backup time.\n\nOtherwise I like that everything is digital with radio presets."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent sound. Everything works as expected. Only (minor) conmplaint: like other reviewers, I would have liked a brighter display of time, station #, etc. to offset that yellow background light."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews but this clock radio has exceeded expectations. Was easy to set up, brightness is completely controllable and the color of the back light much better than the clock I was replacing. Radio reception is great and even stations that won't come in on my stereo tune in on this. The gradual volume increase on the alarm makes the wake up process much more pleasant!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: After 4 tries to obtain an AM\/FM radio that had the sensitivity to pick up the stations we wanted to listen to in the kitchen, this radio finally satisfied our requirements - right sized (small), came with antenna.  We didn't need stereo or really hi-fi like sound, Just needed to hear our favorite station and this works well. Yes, other reviews said the reception was marginal, but for us this radio does the job since it has a digital tuner it can separated out the weaker stations from the high power ones.  The radio doesn't do HD, just the basic AM\/FM."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Reception is very good in our fringe area. However, display is hard to read...  numbers are light black not red as shown in web picture. Changing brightness of back-lighing only helps a little. Disapontd"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is an excellent radio.  My radio is in my home office tucked underneath a monitor and I still get excellent reception.  The volume is more than adequate and packs some punch.  I can turn it up pretty loud and still hear it clearly even when I walk out of the room. I really like having five preset AM and five preset FM stations... which is one of the main reasons I bought this.  I like to listen to the radio while I'm working and it's nice to be able to simply press a button to listen to my favorite stations instead of having to fine tune back and forth between stations. The display is bright and easy to read.  The display feature gives the option to view the station you're listening to or go back to the time.  The size is perfect and I like the black and gray colors that allows it to blend in with everything on the desk.\n\nI'll admit that  I don't utilize the alarm at all, so I can't comment on the nap or snooze or any of those things, but I'm sure if you scroll up or down, you'll read other reviews of those features."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I love Sangean products.  This one, however, is a bit confusing.  The buttons are so close together - easy to confuse if it's dark.  I've have several times hit the \"Nap\" button unknowingly, only to be awoken 1\/2 hour later, not sure what's going on.  Poorly designed."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Perfect little radio for my bathroom. Gets great reception. With the screen on max it makes a great night light. Good sound. AUX in for my iPhone. Easy to set. Lots of options. Large screen that is easy to read."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: My husband got this desktop radio for me to use a work. It is east to set up and I like the antenna so my reception is great. I am also happy with the ability to preset stations."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Radio turned out to be a disappointment.  My wife and I enjoy waking up to the NPR station(FM).  Despite numerous attempts at positioning the FM antenna we were never able to get clean and clear reception of the station.  Ironically we use the Sangean PR-D5 radio in the bathroom right on the other side of the wall with no such reception problem for the NPR Radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Have not been put to the real test yet but the reception of radio stations seems to be the best out of any other clock radio that my wife has used."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Can't give it 5 stars, only 4 - it has virtually no battery backup. The manual states it lasts only 10 min or so from a  power failure before it loses all settings. Wish it lasted longer. But a good clock all in all. Once you get the hang of setting the alarm - it becomes a breeze. It is absolutely superb that you can fully adjust the display brightness from a turn knob on the underside of the clock. I mostly bought it for this reason. And the display is not harsh at all, I had no trouble getting to sleep"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Nice radio but had a little trouble on the reception of a few am stations.  Had to move it around for them to come in better....could be where we are...who knows?"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: For the most part, the clock works pretty well. However, when we try to update the year to 2014, it won't stay programmed that way. It's kind of odd. It's also hard to turn the ringers off; you have to press a completely different button than the ones you do to set the alarm. Setting the alarm can also bit a bit laborious."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love this clock radio. Perfect size. Looks great in black. Wonderful sound. Love that it has two programmable alarms that can be Mon-Fri, Sat\/Sun or one time. Love the sleep and nap modes. I need a male to male 3.5mm cable so add $8 but o\/w i can't express how satisfied i am. It replaced an ailing sony cd dream machine. Good riddance to that now that I have this!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: After much searching I decided on this radio.  Had trouble setting the alarm.  Finally gave up.  Whatever I did, at 6:00 am the alarm would come on.  I would turn it off and it would come on again.  Then I would unplug it.  Finally I took it to the kitchen table where I could see the face of the clock clearly and with book in hand finally figured it out.  There were more choices than I had ever seen.  So far, so good.  It is a nice clock, just read directions carefully."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is an excellent bedside radio.  I knew it was as soon as I plugged it in and started to set up, which for me can sometimes be very confusing.  Not so with this radio.  The manual is extremely clear, and it was ready to go in a jiffy.  The reception is excellent,  not usually so where I live.  It's very easy to turn on with my eyes closed when I wake up in the night, another plus.  I like it a lot."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It's a really well made device, something that's getting rare in today's disposable electronics culture.  From front angles it looks somewhat pretty, from side angles the shiny grey, plastic sides and back look utilitarian.  Not a strong choice if you are looking for decorator design.\n\nThe radio is impressive for the size and price of the unit.  Setting the radio alarm is a bit confusing, but you get used to it pretty quickly.  The volume rise feature on the alarm\/radio is nice and you can set the volume you want in the morning as a part of the alarm setting so you could have low volume music to go to sleep and have louder music to awaken.\n\nI did return the item for two reasons:\n\n1. The LCD display is hard to read in low to medium light unless you turn up the amber-colored backlight.  But if you turn it up, it will be too bright in a dark room for sleeping.  It doesn't auto switch between day and night lighting.\n\n2. It has a built in battery but it only lasts for a short time if the power goes out.  Good for momentary brownouts, but if the power drops for an hour while you sleep, you won't be getting woken up."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: VERY PLEASED WITH BOTH THE APPEARANCE AND THE CLOCK. LARGE NUMBERS AND DUAL ALARM ARE ESPECIALLY WELCOME. THE ONLY NEGATIVE IS THE POOR QUALITY OF THE RADIO. COULD BE CLEARER."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I live in the country so my previous alarm clocks just wouldn't clearly tune into a radio station. It would always be a little fuzzy. This clock is awesome & I haven't a problem. The light is a little brighter than I prefer but live the rest of the features!!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This unit was one of many I tried for a neighbor who has finger curl and issues the senior world suffers from. After trying many radios having varying features my neighbor greeted me with a big hug and a smile. She stated \" why didn't we try this one first? I love it. So, what more can I say than this is the radio for seniors or any one suffering from finger curl and wishes to easily step from one preset station to another."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Ability to save five stations is huge improvement over the antique model it replaced.\n\nDecent sound.  Alarm not too jarring.  Bought this model a few months ago for a vacation house.  Liked it so much I just bought a second one to upgrade my NYC nest."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I work in an old building that does not let FM in at all.  After 4 other desk radios I found this one!  It is the best no static! Good sound and small form factor."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This radio is compact and has a lot of nice features.  The reception is good, even the stations, on which I previously got poor reception.  I highly recommend it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: We weren't looking for anything too complicated or with more features than necessary,\njust an alarm and radio mode, does the trick for us, and this is just fine.\nGood price, fairly easy to see the display, it just works, and that's all we wanted."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I had an analog tuner before, this digital tuner is way easier. Can't see the display as good as I would like at night. And, the user manual takes a little imagination to read correctly, (translation from writer language to correct reader language)."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was looking for a smallish radio that had a headphone jack, digital tuning, some preset stations, and an audio aux input.  That particular combination turns out to be less common than I expected.  This radio only allows for 5 preset FM stations (I wish it was 2 or 3 times as many,) but It feels well constructed, has good reception and suits my purposes fine for the price.  I don't need the alarm so i don't know how well that works."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: For some reason, the white model was a bit cheaper, so I got a white one. White is also easier to see in the dark,\nso that's another consideration, even though black is \"hipper\", or something.\n\nIt has 10 (ten) total presets--5 AM, and 5 FM, which is reasonably ample.\n\nHas a very decent sound, for a small radio speaker.\n\nReception seems fairly strong.\n\nEasy to operate and understand, IMO.\nCompact size, nice lit on\/off button (lights when off) .\nVolume wheel on side, out-of-the-way, but convenient.\n\nWhat's not to like?"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: This item was returned.\n\nDifficult to set time, alarm, etc features..  LED's too bright., kept us awake.  It had good reception but the negative features out weighed keeping it."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The volume control didn't work. I purchased this product because it had an earphone jack that would enable me to use a pillow speaker with the alarm"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The back ground on the display is lit up bright and the time is very dull.  It is so hard to see what time it is.  Sending back!!!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I was looking for a decent quality clock radio with intuitive controls and, most importantly, the capacity for dimming the display.  This display has the widest range of brightnesses I've ever seen.  It can be dimmed very low, to the point where it doesn't illuminate the room (or keep me awake), yet is easily legible in the dark."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: When I needed to replace my bedroom clock radio, I first tried a more expensive radio that also would play and charge my iPhone.  Unfortunately, its FM reception was poor and so I sent it back.  I did more research and found that several reviewers said this Sangean radio had excellent reception, so I decided to give it a try.  In fact the reception was better than any other radio that I have owned during the twenty years I have lived in this house.  The sound quality also is very good for the price. The alarm works very well and once I got used to its operation, I found it easy to set.  The radio is nice looking and small enough to fit on my night table.  A minor complaint is that the brightness control for the clock is located underneath the radio.  Since I do need to dim it at night and brighten it in the morning, I have to pick it up twice a day.  I would prefer a control that is easier to access.  Overall, however, I am very pleased and recommend this to anyone who needs a basic clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Arrived on time and works as advertised.  SNOOZE length is fixed at 5 minutes but NAP length can vary from 5 minutes up to 2 hours, in 5 minute steps. I hope the next version allows for an external 9v battery backup because the internal battery backup is good for just 10 minutes during a power failure."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a nice clock radio. It's an attractive design. It sounds pretty good, considering its size. The owner's manual is easy to follow. It has a headphone jack which accepts 1\/8\" stereo headphones, but plays (in both ears) mono. It would be a bonus if the radio played through the headphone jack in stereo, so you could enjoy stereo through headphones or powered speakers. The aux input accepts stereo plugs. Seems like that design feature would not cost the company much, if anything, and would make this clock radio a much better deal."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I purchased a larger Sangean digital and was so impressed I bought the alarm clock RCR-5 for my nightable. It is good with 2 exceptions:  1. the instructions for setting the alarm are very confusing and made setting it a problem....2. the instruction book english needs to be edited to be clear. On the bright side...their customer service rep was really very good at walking me through setting the alarm...So far it is good and a pleasure to have a digital radio...the reception is a bit better as well than my old Sony."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I wanted to replace a clock radio with a pillow speaker connection which requires a sensitive touch to keep active.  This one looked too cheap to believe and it was.  The controls for both volume and tuning were inoperable as was the arlm system.  Thanks for taking it back."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The only thing good about this radio are station preset buttons.  The placement positioning of all the other control buttons is extremely poor.  The orange light is overwhelming--much too bright with no method of adjustment provided.  The overall appearance of is one of average looks and poor quality (materials used).  Performance is, at best, average.  And you get all this for an incredibly high price.  This is a CLEAR case of NOT getting what you pay for.  This product is not worth even half the price, which makes me feel like a fool for having made this purchase and being so gullible.  DO NOT repeat my mistake."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: at night when my partner is sleeping, I plug in my earphones so I don't wake her up but when I turn on the sleep timer, it makes a beep which wakes her up so I can't use the radio when I would normally always use it. I do have another one of these which doesn't do that. I like the radio and will return it for exchange and hope it doesn't beep."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It is hard to set this by touch, and the alarm went off last night.\n\nThat said, this is head and shoulders above the Jensen JCR-310 Top Loading AM\/FM PLL Stereo CD Dual Alarm Clock, that I originally bought and returned.  Good sound."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Beautiful display, nice design and easy setup...and AWESOME AM reception! I got this to listen to talk radio at night as I fall asleep, and it's perfect. I haven't used the alarm function yet because I use my phone for that. But I'm very happy with this and highly recommend it, especially if you are looking for something with great AM reception."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Pros: reception is excellent; good sound quality\n\nCon: setting the time and alarms is not easy; even after several months I keep the owner's manual handy."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I'll admit that I don't use all the features of this Clock Radio. I bought it because I wanted an AM radio next to my bed with a headphone jack. My \"bed partner\" is a very light sleeper and can't handle any noise. And I am the opposite: I sleep best with some mindless chatter from a talk radio station echoing in my head. So I wanted a) good AM reception and b) a headphone jack. This offered both.\n\nThe reception is good. I live in the middle of a large, dense city, and reception is sometimes a problem. At first, I thought the reception was mediocre on this radio, but then I stretched the power cord out to maximum, to see if it would function as an antenna. It did. Now the reception is great on all the stations I like.\n\nThe headphone jack works as it should. No complaints there.\n\nThe clock is also very easy to program. I don't use the alarm, but setting of the time was extremely intuitive, and a quick glance at the instructions made the alarm programming function look pretty much the same.\n\nThe display is nice and bright, and adjustable, which is nice.\n\nThat's about all I have to say about it. Five stars for my needs."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It gets great radio reception, and I like that you can program two different alarms (say, one for M-F and a different one for the weekend). But the snooze is every 5 minutes and can't be changed, and the buttons are crappy. You have to really mash on them a few times before anything happensnot what you want when you're trying to hit snooze."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I was tired of the poor quality radio\/alarm i've had over the years and decided to pay a little extra for this one and it was worth it. You notice the quality right out of the box. Good sound quality. All the options you would want. Quality feel. My only complaint was the way they lined all the buttons up in a row and you have to always look or memorize which buttons do what. If you are looking for quality this is the one."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I mistakenly bought this clock because I thought it would stay in contact with a satellite and automatically reset itself. (The instruction manual is so sketchy that I STILL might be mistaken!) It's attractive, and the black-on-orange time is easy to read. The sound is good on the radio settings, noticeably muffled when I listen to an MP3 player on AUX. I like that a ten-minute backup battery comes with the clock. I would buy a Sangean again -- but next time I'd shop more carefully."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I recently reviewed this clock-radio from Sangean and approved its functions.  However, since that time, I have noticed that a wrong day\/date of week was being displayed.  I and my husband tried several times to correct day\/date but without success!  Day\/Date kept changing back to its previous settings!  And...without being able to set time\/day\/date, I am unable to set the 'alarm clock'!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Setting the dual alarms seems unnecessarily complicated.  Otherwise I've experienced no other problems. Unit is compact requiring only a small amount of space on the bedside stand, a desirable feature."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love the sound quality of this radio. I listen to mostly talk shows and the spoken word comes across as very clear, crisp and warm.  The backlight is orange and I wish I could change it.  It really stands out against the white case (you can dim the backlight, but only so much).  Button placement could have been better designed.  For example, the on\/off button is awkwardly placed behind the band button.  But on the whole I am very pleased with this purchase."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is the one to have if one wants a very good bedside radio.  Good audio for its size, very easy to program.  The only minor problem I have is that the battery in not replaceable and only holds memory for 5 minutes if unplugged."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This little clock radio is the perfect addition to the kitchen.  The styling is sleek, the sound quality is quite good, and operating instructions are simple."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: I didn't give this a 5 star because it has its problems in programing.  The radio, clock and most features work as designed.  There has been a problem getting it to stay on the correct date.  It programs the correct date until you return to the run mode and it goes to yet another year and day of the week.  The radio is great and the sleep mode for what I purchased it for rates a 5 but can't give it for the other reasons."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio is just what i was looking for. It looks nice and my mother needded an easy to use digital radio and she is really happy"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Many reviewers complained about the bright light on the face, but it caused us no problems.  I especially like the buttons for different stations.  The alarm system takes a like while to learn, but works fine."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I got this clock because I wanted presets.  My old Sony worked fine but tuning was so difficult I usually kept in one one station.  This has 5 AM and 4 FM presets and digital tuning.  Unfortunately the FM tuner is so bad that I can hardly get any FM stations and I live in an urban area with many FM stations.  My Sony did much better.  Every button is rounf and has the same tactile feel.  There is a row of 9 identical buttons.  Since I often use the radio at night, it's very hard to use in the dark.  Also, the buttons are very stiff and over half the time I get a soft click but the button-push does not register.  I have to press it again harder.  Each button seems to be covered in soft plastic.  I don't know for sure, but I suspect that these buttons.will not last long."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I had an 'inexpensive' clock radio that was just ok...but frustrating when trying to hone onto a station.  This Sangean radio has absolutely everything I needed, from ease of set-up to push button station accessibility.  And the volume dial is just an extra plus with its click-like control.!  It, too, was inexpensive but definitely NOT cheap in design.  Although it cost about the same as my previous clock radio it is SO much more going for it.  I would recommend it to anyone that wants an easy clock radio with a small footprint but a large sound."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The digital tuning and the digital volume are exactly what I wanted.  For a small radio, the sound is even better than I expected.  This was an excellent buy."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This Sangean is by far, the best clock radio I've ever owned. It is well worth the money. I use it in my bathroom and\nit sits on the vanity. I love to listen to radio while dressing and the reception on this radio is far superior to that of\na cheaper clock radio that I used prior to this one. The clock keeps perfect time and that too is good. The radio is\nattractive, neat and you can rely on it. I highly recommend this clock radio and I am happy that I traded in my old\none."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I needed a bedside radio for an alarm.  I've now gotten addicted to listening to the radio for the news just before I rise in the morning and before I go to sleep at night.  It is a perfect companion."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio is the best I have ever had!  Because of it's digital tuning, I am finally able to get radio stations at my desk in my office without difficulty finding a station or the aggravation of the signal fading away.  I highly recommend this to anyone for use anywhere in the home or office!!!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The quality of this radio has surprised me thus far, especially at this price point. Hopefully it remains reliable in the long term as well."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Good sound, nice looks.  Digital clock gains time, requires frequent adjusting.  Would be nice to set it a favorite wake up station and forget it even if you change it during the day. Would also be nice to automatically go to correct time as\nthe last Timex I had."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The clock radio is simple but efficient---and gets a good FM signal.  Sound is perfectly OK for a small unit.  The directions are in Chinese English, so they can sometimes be a slight bit confusing and amusing, but the clock radio is very much as advertised.  I wouldn't mind a more calibrated \"sleep\" function (it is in 15 minute intervals), but otherwise, I'm fully satisfied."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The only thing this clock is missing is a readout of the song and artist. Love the gradual alarm wake-ups and how you can choose how loud the alarm is. And the programmable buttons.  This is a great value for the money,  Love it!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I really want a clock radio with digital presets.  the Sony Dream Machine has a preferred set of buttons, but doesn't have the presets.  This radio is attractive, has all the features I need--sleep set, nap and presets so I'm pretty happy with it, but ...You do have to set the time and pay attention to the display as you are setting the sleep time.  Minor issues, but worth a star."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This clock radio gets good marks on many of its features EXCEPT -- and this is a biggie for me -- I have trouble reading the display at night without my glasses on. As a matter of fact, I can't read the time at all. I've tried changing the display brightness up & down without success. My old clock radio with red Digits on black background was easy to read. This display with thin black numbers on a bright gold-ish background is blurry.\n\nI'm going to see if I can find a magnifier to mount on the front."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Besides the usual problems, bright display, hard to set alarms, etc., the transformer started humming so loud you can't sleep anywhere near it.  Had this radio been engineered to simplify the controls and allow the display (not just the digital numbers) to be dimmed and had the transformer been manufactured with a little quality built in,  this could have been a great radio.  Sangean's online support says that the \"warranty period for a particular product is listed below\".  BUT, there is nothing there.  I clicked on \"register\" and it says the site is under construction.  It is 14 months old, so I guess I am screwed.  I will continue checking and update this review if they ever post any information."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It takes care of all things a clock radio should. I especially like the \"nap\" feature that lets you set the alarm for a 10 -120 minute nap. I don't like the phased wake up where the radio is very soft at the alarm and then gets louder. I would like it to be loud right away, but someone else might feel differently about that. That is the only problem. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was so tired of cheap clock radios. . .  The RCR-5 is solid, highly accurate in both clock and tuning, and gets excellent reception.  Very happy with it!  There are two challenges to know, however, before buying.  First, the viewing angle is limited.  Sitting on the night stand - about six inches above the level of my bed - I must lift up in bed to read the time.  It would be nice just to open my eyes and glance.  (I'm playing with a little wooden prop to angle it down - we'll see).  Second, setting the alarm is a multi-step process and, initially, not intuitive.  You may be tearing your hair until you figure it out.  However, once you take the time to read the manual (really pretty short and concise)and do it a couple of times, it is fine and only takes about 10 seconds.  The up side of the process is it's a no-question set-up for the morning (I always use the \"once\" setting because I get in trouble trying to use M-F or Sat\/Sun type settings).\n\nBottom line:  It works and, overall, is the best alarm I have ever owned.  Take a few minutes to read the literature and then play with it for a little bit to become familiar with how it works. You will be surprised how fast you internalize the process.  Although it could potentially be improved somewhat with better design, it may be one of those situations in which, to be most effective, you want a device that is made as simple as it can be, but no simpler.  (was it Einstein who said that?)\n\nCheers and thanks for a great product!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love my digital radio.  It is very difficult to find these and this one is durable, accurate, easy to set.  I would recommend it and am going to order another one."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I really like this radio.....Simple to use, good reception,nice sound.  I was hoping to replace my current bedside clock\/radio with this one, but the size was simply too small.  did not fit the footprint.  So i am using it in the kitchen, and it is perfect.  Brings in all the FM stations, no problems, and fits neatly in the corner.  I have another Sangean radio I bought 16 years ago that still works like a charm.........so I knew the brand was reliable. This is a super radio for a good price."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: After going through two Sony units where the LED display gradually faded so much you could not see it at all unless it was completely dark in the room, I decided to look for a backlit LCD unit and found this. Visibility on this unit is excellent. No problem either at night or in full sun. Backlight is continuously adjustable with a knob, and goes to full whenever you hit a button. Sound is the best of any clock radio I have owned, and I love the fact that you can program a \"wake-up\" station so you don't necessarily wake up to the last thing you were listening to. Tuner is also completely digital, so you are never listening to static because you \"bumped\" the analog tuning knob fumbling around on the night table in the dark. The only reason this does not have five stars from me is that I think the alarm programming is unnecessarily complex and difficult. Once you have the two alarms set where you want though, you can just turn them on and off with a single button press, so since we don't change our wake-up times often, I can live with it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I bought this to replace my old analog radio with a scratchy volume control. It is a big improvement. FM reception is very good and I live out in the boonies, far from most stations. AM reception is so-so but about the same as other radios I have.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that setting the alarm shouldn't need to be so complicated. There are a lot of steps, especially if you are going to wake to music. So make sure you put the manual in a safe place, you are going to need it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Got the radio for my wife's office she loves it and it works GREAT ! Like the Long antenna ! Very easy too setup !!!!!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I expected a larger radio with better sound, but it works for the AM radio that I listen to in the shower room.  Preset feature is good."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I like Sangean products and needed a new clock radio so this was an easy decision.  I love the radio, the sound is full and everything you could want from one speaker, but setting and using the alarm is a bit tricky for me.  The quality is there but the actual use of the alarm is difficult, especially in the dark."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Puts me to sleep and wakes me up, it's easy to use and has good sound for such a little box.  The part I like best is the ease in the ability to set 15,30,45 and 60 minute times for play before shutting down.  All the controls are solid; it feels well built."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I couldn't be happier with this radio, which I bought to replace a junky analog model by another manufacturer. It looks great...great reception...ample presets...easy to operate. Did I leave anything out? Oh, yes... I love the nap option!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I had been looking for a small clock radio that had both AM and FM with pre-set buttons for both bands.  This is incrediblly hard to find but, thankfully, I came upon the Sangean and it was just what I wanted and needed.  Also, the directions on how to set the alarm were not written so no one would be able to figure them out (which happened to me with the radios that I had purchased and then returned prior to coming across the Sangean).  I love that I can adjust the brightness of the dial.  Also, I can go back and forth from station to station so easily.  I am very happy and pleased with the quality of the sound also.  I would recommend the Sangean for anyone looking for a radio.  I am a very satisfied customer!!"}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: I have been without reception and NPR in my new apartment.  Finally I have found a radio that works.  There is also an antenna cord on the outside."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I have 3 criteria for a clock radio:\n  1. Good FM reception\n  2. Good AM reception\n  3. Easy of use\n\nThe radio tuner is this clock radio is acceptable, whereas most others that I tried are optimistically called Clock RADIO.  It's not great, just better than most others.  The buttons are well laid out.  I set the alarm and presets.  Went to bed and woke up being able to operate it in the dark.  It surprised me how well I remembered the button layout, basically out of the box.  The amber light is bright but doesn't fill the room with light (genius!).\n\nProblems:\n- Second alarm cannot have radio, instead you're left with \"Human\".\n- Alarm will default to \"Human\" if it is turned off with one band and the alarm is set for the other.  That alarm starts soft and ends too soon.  It repeats, but if your used to loud-mouthed, arrogant DJs to awaken you, you could oversleep.\n\nConclusion:\nIf grading on a scale, this radio would get 6 stars.  It outclasses most others, especially reception.  But, your gonna have to battle it out with your spouse over who gets the very \"Human\" alarm."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great radio at a reasonable price.  Fabulous AM and FM reception and good sound for a compact unit.  This is the second Sangean radio I have purchased and they are both great units."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Sangean has clearly put some thought into this radio. Small details make this a pleasure. The on\/off button is lit when it is off and dark when the radio is on, in the dark it makes sense. The volume control is a knob (although unfortunately with steps), much better than a button. The reception is very good. The alarms do not go through the headphone (or pillow speaker), very thoughtful. The backlighting is adjustable. It suits my needs almost perfectly."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: It is small sized, but has a lot of features.  It has two alarms with M-F, WE, or 7D functions.  It has volume ramp up when the alarm goes off.  Volume slowly increases, so you don't get jarred awake by the radio.  A single speaker with adequate sound.  Digital tuner reduces drift on AM stations.  Excellent reception on weak FM stations.  Five AM and five FM presets.  The adjustable backlit clock is highly visible, both day and night. I wish it had an audio output and stereo, but you can't beat the price."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: better than i expected, adjustable dimmer iworks great. reception is much better than sony it replaced. digital tuning is very easy to use along with the preset buttons."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This radio has woken me up at 3:51 a.m. when it's set for 7:00 a.m!  Not to mention it DIDN'T go off one morning at 7:00--only to find it somehow reset itself to go off at 7:00 p.m., which it did!  The owner's manual is pretty lamely written, and THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE INFO, nor anything said about what to do if you have problems with the product!  Both my husband and I had trouble figuring this clock out (and he has a Master's Degree in Technology!!!)"}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I have 3 other Sangean radios, PR-D7, and love those. This one was awful. It shouldn't be so hard to set up a radio. The battery back-up is a joke. I read the reviews and saw that others had the same problem with the battery part but I thought how hard could that be? I should have listened to them. I may have gotten the compartment open if I didn't care if the cover cracked but I was already frustrated with the rest of it. I sent it back which is something I seldom do."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This radio is appallingly bad.  I live 9 miles from Boston.  There are numerous mainline Boston stations I cannot receive on this radio that I can on $9 transistor.  What a piece of junk!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: A solid basic clock radio with several useful features, especially the variable brightness setting and the alarm that starts sotly and then gradually increases in volume. I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife and she loves it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I have had the Sangean Clock Radio for just over a month now and it is exactly what I was looking for.\nSetting and using the alarms is easy after one or two reads of the manual. It has two alarms which is nice. If you have a regular \"get up time\" you can set one alarm and leave it. Then you can use the second alarm for varying times. It also allows you to set the alarm for one time, for daily, week days only, or weekends.\nIt is nice that it has station presets...five for AM and five for FM.\nYou can adjust the light level on the display to suit your needs. Also, when you tap any button the light level increases which is nice in the dark. The light level then goes back to your preset after you are done with adjustments.\nThere is a timer that can be set for 60, 45, 30 or 15 minutes so you can listen to the radio when you go to sleep and it will turn itself off in your preset time.\nAn external single wire antenna makes for good reception which can be a challenge in my area. Reception and quality of sound is good.\nThis was a good value at a fair price. I am very happy with this purchase!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The screen showing the time was just too dim to read at night. After I have been asleep, my eyes don't focus well and I could not read the time.\nWill be returning it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I really like the way this radio sounds and looks. I have not yet been able to set the year, month, date and time even though I have read the directions carefully. Hope it's not because I got a used one that doesn't work. Probably not since I got two, since I liked the first one so much, and can't set either one. Have the station set easily and find the radio very good and easy to make louder and softer"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Bought the RCR-5 for my wife.  She wanted a radio in the bathroom to get traffic updates and weather before leaving in the morning.  We use it as a table radio, not an alarm clock, so I can't comment on it's alarm features.\n\nWe really like it as a radio.  The tone and volume from this small package are surprisingly good.  We have no trouble getting the AM stations that we want to hear, even some low power stations that are not close. The digital tuner does a good job of filtering out the nearby station that ruins AM reception for several stations on cheap analog tuner radios.  Wouldn't waste my money on another analog tuner model after owning this digital model.  The yellow face light is a little unusual, but not objectionable.  The radio comes with an attached small diameter wire antenna that is about 30 inches long.  You will need to find a place to run this wire for good reception."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: There are several things I love about this alarm clock.  It is the only alarm clock I have found that has every single feature I wanted (and some I didn't even know existed) at a very reasonable price.  For years I have covered up the face of my previous alarm clock (that finally broke) with an old baby bib because the bright numbers would wake me up every night and practically illuminate the whole room.  This clock allows you to dim the face from very bright to completely dark, without compromising my ability to see it clearly during daylight hours.  It has a nap button that I can set to any amount of time to accommodate my 20-minute power naps to a blissfully long two-hour snooze--no need to set the alarm and the forget to reset it before bedtime and accidentally oversleep.  I can wake to any one of six pre-set radio stations or to an alarm.  Both have something called the \"Humane Waking System\", which starts out quiet and then increases in volume to a maximum volume that I can set.  It also gives me the option of plugging my iPhone into it to wake to my own music.  It has two separate alarms for couples.  Finally, I can set alarms for one-time, weekdays and weekends!  I've never seen that before and I love it because I do like to sleep in an extra hour on the weekends and hate having to remember to switch my alarm back on Sunday nights.  Best alarm clock ever!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: the item was shipped promptly and packaged with care. It is a very compact radio and I have no complaints regarding its range.  I live about 35 miles from the tower and this not a problem."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This clock radio has all the features I was looking for and more. I'm not sure why it's so hard to find a clock radio with a headphone jack but there it is. This one has it. It's very user friendly, has nice sound quality and excellent reception. The buttons have almost silent operation which is great if you forget to set the alarm after your partner has gone to bed. Our last clock radio had a very annoying clunking sound similar to that board game, Trouble. And I love the back light. It can be dimmed to off and even when it's on the lighting is soft and unobtrusive. I gave it only 4 stars because it's kind of puny in size and it has only a 10 minute battery backup which kind of stinks in the case of a power outage."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This is not an HD radio, only digital tuning on an analog radio.  Nice radio for the kitchen.  I would not use it for your nightstand though.  There is no battery backup on the clock so if the power goes for more than 10 minutes the clock will not wake you up when the power returns."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: HAS TONS OF FEATURES AND RADIO HAS GREAT RECEPTION AND SOUNDS NICE FOR SUCH A SMALL RADIO.  DO NOT LIKE THE LONG STRING ANTENA BUT I WAS ABLE TO BALL IT UP WITH A TWIST TIE AND IT STILL WORKD JUST FINE."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: i switch from station to station. each one is 1push away. Only negative is there is no battery backup. next improvement for Sangean to consider."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I know most radio's today are FM only. It appears to be what the user audience wants to hear.\nFor me however, I like AM sports and talk stations. The Sangean is a super product. It includes digital stations and has five pre sets for each. The quality is very good. I believe this is a very well built radio. The speakers are good quality, and the visual display is very good. The size is also ideal. I'm very happy with my purchase."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The Sangean RCR-5 is just the type of digital clock radio I was looking for.(1) great sound quality, (2) readable digital figures, (3) each to use features, (4) has all the features that anyone would want in a digital clock radio, (5) especially like the auto turn off of the radio when desired, (6) great compact size-you would never think that this little radio has so many features."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I found this radio met all my expectations - easy to program, nice sound and very compact.  I had trouble with adjusting the alarm at first, but through an Amazon customer was able to figure it out.  I would absolutely recommend this radio."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: This is a good radio, however, very hard to figure out how to use the alarm clock. The audio in works excellent, however, I use my other alarm clock because I am never sure that I have entered the alarm correct as is so confusing to set."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Very happy with this radio.  Picks up a station in a college town that we were having trouble getting.  Like having presents so we don't lose stations."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I needed a bedside clock-radio to replace the 20-year-old machine that was big, bulky, and struggled to find the exact radio frequencies. This low-profile model meets my needs well. The time and alarms are relatively easy to set--a good thing since the instruction manual was obviously translated (poorly) into English and often gave me only a vague notion of the proper procedures. A few features I appreciate include the dual alarms which can be set for every day, weekdays only, or weekends only. You can also specify the radio station you want to play when the alarm goes off. This is a nice feature if you like to go to sleep to NPR but awaken to Classic Rock. The alarm begins with only a gentle nudge, then progresses in volume to a maximum you can pre-set. Also, unlike my old machine, there is no \"pop!\" or \"snap!\" just before the alarm radio station begins to play.\n\nThe clock does have a couple of minor but annoying quirks. Both the display illumination and radio volume levels are ordinal, not continuous. As such, the lowest increment (level 01) may still be too bright or too loud, respectively, for some persons. Also, I haven't figured out how to turn the alarm function back on without having to step through the entire setting sequence. Again, annoying, but forgiveable. Finally, there is a battery back-up for power outages; the power was recently out in our neighborhood for a few hours while the utility company conducted some maintenace, but the clock retained all my pre-set preferences. The instruction manual advises that the batteries be removed if the clock is going to be unpowered\/unplugged for an extended period. Damned if I can figure out where the batteries are and how to extract them. It seems one would have to disassemble the entire unit.\n\nThese minor bugs aside, I'm quite pleased with the unit."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Yeah its from china my dad already posted what he thought of this. Lets just say i sent his gift back and ordered a much nicer one for less."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I have two of these clock\/radios now.  Enjoy them.  Use them mainly to listen to the radio.  Have not used the alarm functions.\nRadio has good reception.  Got it mainly for the digital tuner.\n\nUpdate:  I now have purchased my 3rd radio.  It has good  reception - love the digital tuner feature."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I bought this for my desk at work as the analog radios keep fading in and out as I have an office in  a large hospital. this gets the radio stations I want with pinpoint accuracy, i also like the input for my IPad and the headphone jack for when other are around."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: My college-age son refused to buy an alarm clock because he wanted to use his phone.  I bought this for him anyway.  After the phone-alarm plan failed (as his parents predicted) he switched to this clock for naps and night time and praised us for knowing what is best."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: A little smaller than anticipated, but still good looking in appearance. The clock was quite visible and adjustable in brightness.  The button settings were relatively easy.  Unfortunately it did not receive all stations that I receive on my other clock radios, so I returned it.  A favorite station of mine literally did not come in, regardless of how I placed the antenna."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a well-designed radio with a great sound for music or talk. I have it on my kitchen counter and it is unobtrusive and blends in perfectly with our colors. It is easy to program stations and I like the push button ease of changing them. It even has aux plugs and ear phone jacks. I am really impressed with this radio - at 20 some dollars, it is a steal! If you are looking for a little clock radio, this is the one for you."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is the second Sangean I've purchased.  I bought one for myself four years ago, and it is still satisfying, if not exceeding, expectations.  The additional aerial wire makes my favorite FM stations clear and steady; and I live in an area with considerable reception problems.\n\nI bought the second one as a flat-warming present for my daughter, and she is just as satisfied.  Gets great reception in urban NYC.  I would definitely recommend this product without reservation."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Just what I wanted.  Has jack for earphones, digital readout, good sound, tells me if the radio is on or off and keeps good time."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I'm downgrading my review now that I've had the unit for 6 months. The on\/off button stopped working! After only 6 months! This renders the radio next to useless. I say \"next to\" because I am now leaving it on constantly so that I can still use it. When I don't want it on, I turn the volume all the way down.\n\nI have not abused the buttons in any way. The problem comes with the design. Since the \"sleep\" function requires the same button, that button gets used more often than it should. I would turn the unit on once every evening, then I would set the sleep function. They should never have designed the sleep function with the on\/off button. And there's no excuse for such a vital button not working after only 6 months.\n\nMy original review...\n\nI am so happy with this little radio. It's small, so it fits on my little bedside table. The backlight on the readout can be adjusted so it isn't so bright at night. The sound is awesome! I can turn the device to face any direction and the sound doesn't fuzz out like the analog radio I used to have. It was easy to program, even for a 56 year old lady like me. I'm thinking about getting another one or two to keep in different areas of the house."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: have used radio for several nights and it works fine. above average reception of am and fm, and i am 50 miles from st. louis. can get big out of town stations at night. easy to use. compact and sturdy. clear display with adjustable light level. 10 preset stations. volume control has detent dial, easy to adjust in dark. easy to set time, alarm, stations. alarm has tone feature that sounds over the radio to awake.\n\ndrawbacks:\n\n1. unit uses adapter rather than regular corded wall pug.\n\n2. i like to listen to talk radio at night and sound has more low range. better for music than spoken word.\n\n3. \"nap\" button in next to last station preset, so easy to activate by mistake in dark. but not easy to deactivate.\n\nthere are no other alarm units with digital station presets to my knowledge at this price point. would prefer a radio with more treble and less bass. otherwise, nice product so far."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great clock radio - brings in many stations.  Only problem is, (for me) I wish the clock display was easier to read - especially in the middle of the night with no glasses on!  Otherwise, very pleased and satisfied."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The radio was perfect but I live in Australia and did not realise that it won't work on our 240volt power.  Such a shame as it has all the features I was looking for."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: A nice clock radio. I bought a Sangean short wave radio in the early 1990s when I moved to Europe for a year. It was a brand I had not heard of but the sound was great and the radio worked very well.\nThis clock radio has a digital tuner (many do not) so the stations lock in well. Non of my analog tuners on clock radios work in my house because I live too close to a bunch of radio towers and have aluminum siding. This one works great being a digital tuner.\nThe two alarms are nice in that you can pick days they go off. I chose M-F for both but one 30 minutes later (back up).\nIt is a bit annoying in that you can't seem to just turn on and turn off an alarm easily. You have to click through the various settings in activating an alarm to activate one or turn it off. A total hassle. Maybe you can but, I don't see it anywhere or it is not intuitive.\nThis means that, if you want to sleep in on a holiday weekday you normally use an alarm to go to work, it is kind of a pain. You can't just turn down the volume wheel as, and this is ironically, a good thing, each alarm can be set to a *custom* volume level! Not only does it go from very very low ascending up in volume when it goes off but it will stop at a custom level for each alarm. Nice.\nThere is a headphone jack and mini input jack on the side. So you can play a smart phone and listen to any internet radio on the planet. I wonder if the headphone audio is stereo? Which leads me to make this comment: The speaker audio quality is so so. Muffled and lacking in treble. It is one speaker. They should have made it stereo for the price! But, wait, headphones? Are they mono? I need to check. Weird...\nThe picture shows a white radio but it is more yellowish white. The sides are a light gray, not black or dark grey as the image seems to show. My unit was made just a couple months before I got it so, I know it is not a yellowing of the plastic but, it is just not as pure a white as the image shows.\nOne other issue I found frustrating is that the display is not tilted up slightly. I am adding some rubber dot or square stick on feet (found at discount stores) to the front of it to raise it up a little so I can see it from in bed or standing by the bed. I have never had to do this with standard tilted display clock radios (I have owned since a kid - they last 5-10+ years typically) by Sony (analog radio with CD, still going), Oregon Scientific (digital, with phone, dead in 4 years), RCA (LED screen got wonky then useless in 7 years), etc.\nIf they did the fixes I mentioned, it would be worth it. If they added HD radio and did adjustments to make it easier to use and stereo, Sangean could charge another 20 and it would be a great radio. Right now, it is B+ (which is better than much out there) but not the best price.\nHowever, in my case, the dual alarm with digital tuner makes it the only clock radio (that looks nice, is small, etc.) that will work in my house! I'm keeping it - with small rubber feet under the front."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I've never purchased a higher end clock radio than the cheapest models from the discount store, but I splurged on this one.  I'm so glad I did!  The overall look of it is really unique on my nightstand and the amber display is so much nicer than the typical neon green glow.  It's got a nice dimmer on the display too, since it can get pretty bright.  The controls aren't the most intuitive but the manual is clear and helpful.  The radio works well and the sound is good.  I'm very pleased with this purchase!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: My wife and I like to use pillow speakers at night to listen to news, music, sports, etc.  It's surprisingly difficult to find a clock radio that has an earphone jack into which to plug the speakers!  So, we have \"twin Sangeans\" and they work reasonably well.  The button arrangement for presets can be tricky to negotiate by feel alone (all the buttons are the same size, and there are a lot of them for not only the presets, but off-on, alarms, and band).  But, there are five presets, which is helpful, and an easy digital tuning mechanism.  AM and FM reception are adequate, but not great.  Some FM stations suffer from adjacent channel interference, which I think should not happen with local stations.  In general, this is a good product at a reasonable price, and if you want that earphone jack, you'll find it here."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Update: The battery backup only lasts for several minutes. If you have a longer power outage it loses all settings. This makes it unreliable as an alarm clock.\n\nSo far it works great. A better design for the buttons would make it easy to change channels in the dark. Also it is NOT stereo. Only alarm clock I could find at a reasonable price that had digital tuner and ear bud output."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is an excellent, attractive clock-radio that I have had for over a month. The radio tuner locks quite well to the stations, the sound is clear, and I've been able to easily locate a number of FM and AM stations throughout my area. The controls for setting the date\/time and both alarms, while somewhat different from other clock-radios, are easily learned and reliable. Just follow the directions. I wish the volume level was adjustable for each alarm independent of the radio volume. The only other wish I have is that the dimmer control was more conveniently located on either the side or back of the radio; it is somewhat difficult to turn the control with it located on the bottom of the case while having such a short shaft to compensate for its location."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: what a great radio!!! We use it every morning and it is dependable, efficient, good looking, has some\ngreat features, has a perfect sound system, is lightweight, and the lighted screen is easy to read. This is\na reliable purchase and is just the right size!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I have had several lower cost clock radios, all of which proved unsatisfactory.  An important factor has been the difficulty of station tuning.  This model has the excellent digital tuning that I learned to appreciate on Sangean's pocket radios.  It is not as good as my Bose Wave, but so far seems an excellent  value."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: Just what I was looking for in a clock radio. Reasonably priced and simple to operate. It tells me the time and wakes me up. What else do you need?"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Living in Australia, we have 240 volt. The literature didn't mention anything about not working on 240 volt. My parcel arrived and I excitedly unpack my new Sangean RCR-5 Digital AM\/FM Clock Radio only to see the smoke and subsequent Fuse Box (house) click off.\nThat was the end of that ... It doesn't work in Australia ... Perhaps there should be more information on the product description about the power source and the fact that it doesn't work on 240 volt\nI had to throw it in the rubbish bin ...\nSadly Cam ..."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It's a good, basic alarm clock radio with a digital tuner.\n\nPros:\n- Does everything it is supposed to\n- Beep alarm starts softly and increases in volume\n- Digital tuner\n- Radio is good as long as antenna cord is dangled or raised from radio, station is strong or moderate strength, and the desired volume is moderate for same room use.\n\nCons:\n- Alarm volume could be louder towards the end of the loudness increasing cycle.\n- Interface is non-obvious enough that you'll have to read the short manual (10 small pages with big type and some pictures).  It is simple enough that you'll probably only need to read the manual once.\n- Radio reception is poor is the antenna cord isn't either dangled down or raised up.  Radio reception experiences bleed over from neighboring stations on weakest stations.  Radio max volume is fine for same room use, but don't expect to blare the radio.\n- Battery backup only lasts 10 minutes\n\nNow some lesser published info:\n- The brightness on the display is adjustable from extremely dim to pretty bright.  At the dimmest setting it puts out enough light to just see your thumb in a dark room at 6 inches from the display.  In other words, you'll definitely see it if looking at it in a dark room but it will be very dim.  At the brightest setting, the display is very bright if you look at it, but not so bright that it lights up the room that much.  Basically, it will cast a pale light in the vicinity of the clock (within ~ 3'), but I couldn't even see the effect on the far wall of the room (~ 12' away).  The power light in the upper right of the top is also lit red, but it is dim at all times.  The brightness of the display goes to max after hitting a button for about 3 seconds and then returns to the set brightness.  The brightness setting knob is analog and on the bottom of the unit.\n- The radio reception works ok for me.  It is very sensitive to the antenna position.  For the faintest stations it seems to only work well if I am touching the antenna.  The strong and moderate stations work fine with the antenna cord either hanging down from the unit or raised up from the unit.\n- The snooze is fixed at 5 minutes and not adjustable.  If the alarm goes off and you hit the snooze twice, it still goes off in 5 minutes.  (Just what I wanted)\n- The human wake system feature starts with a quiet beep and goes to more frequent and louder beeps.  It starts off inaudible and goes up to about the loudness of a typical alarm clock over the course of 1 minute.  If that fails to wake you, it will be silent for 1 minute, then repeat the 1 minute on, 1 minute off cycle for 1 hour before giving up.  The second cycle also starts quiet and builds over the minute.  The increasing volume only applies to the buzzer; the radio volume is controlled only by the analog wheel on the side of the unit.\n- There is a nap feature on the unit that lets you set an alarm for 10-120 minutes from now in 10 minute increments.\n- There is a sleep timer feature that will shut off the radio after 15, 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes.\n- When you set the alarm, you can chose between triggering every day, every weekday, every weekend day, or only once.  The unit keeps track of the year, date, and time.  It knows about the days of the week.  You cannot set the alarm for any other collection of days, those are the only options, so if you want an alarm for M-W-F then you'll need to look elsewhere.\n- The display usually displays AM\/PM HH:MM:ss, day of week, and which alarms are set.  There is an icon for snooze active.  The display shows band, frequency, and preset memory slot when radio is on for about 5 seconds then switches to time display as \"HH:MM on\".  You hit a button to see year and hit again to see MM-DD.\n- The sound quality on the radio is good but not powerful.  The audio starts clipping at around 1\/2 volume on the knob which is a moderate volume (good in same room only, won't be able to blast your ears at all).\n- There is an AUX in socket on the radio.  It is for playing only, not for alarm.\n- There is a headphone jack.  When headphones are plugged in, the speaker is muted.\n- The battery backup is only good for keeping the time and settings for 10 minutes.\n- The display can be switched between 12 hour display and 24 hour display.\n- There are 5 preset stations per band.  The are 2 bands: FM and AM.\n- The FM tuning step can be switched between 0.2MHz and 0.1MHz for the US version.\n- The AM tuning step is 9KHz for the US version from 520-1710KHz.\n- The power adapter is 120V\/60Hz only for US version which converts to 6V\/0.5A with a standard coax plug into the back of the unit."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: These are great, small (or rather not too big), easy to read clock\/station. Presets, earphone plugs, nice. Bought two of em, so we each have one. Finally a product from Sangean that even a layman can operate."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Forget all those naysayers!  For a compact am\/fm clock radio this one is excellent.  Great sensitivity to weak signals, great neighboring station selectivity, and great capture-ratio (ability to reject weaker signals on the same frequency).  Of  c o u r s e  it's  s m a l l !!  If you want high fidelity get a bigger receiver!  If the buttons and displays do not do what you want them to, follow the instructions on page 13 and do a \"factory reset\" (just read the excellent English instructions!).  And c'mon, guys, you don't get much fm reception without stringing an external antenna, plus accept the fact that the am antenna is internal and make the set face transverse to the direction of the signal if it is weak.  The display brightness is continuously variable and readable from any reasonable angle!  And, yes, it can be used as a dim night light.  All-in-all this little set is head and shoulders over those dinky clock radios, and with phase locked loop digital tuning to boot!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great radio.  Excellent reception.  It can even receive AM stations in office with fluorescent lighting when other radios that I  have tried have no reception."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: It wouldn't pick up AM stations at all.  Setting the alarm is difficult.  Once I figured it out, there was no way to turn off Alarm #1.  The instructions are poorly written with no trouble-shooting help and no phone number for questions.  So, unfortunately, it went back."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I regret tossing my cheap old clock radio. The old one didn't have great reception, but the Sangean RCR-5 is worse! I thought digital tuning would help, but it doesn't.  The other features may be fine, but who cares, if you have to keep moving the radio and fiddling with the antenna in order to hear programs.  I live in Boston, and even very local radio stations play with lots of background interference."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a great little radio.  Seems to be well made and is compact.  It brings in a really difficult station and the sound is clear.  I wanted it for the presets and it's so easy to set them.  I have one AM station I like to listen to also and what I love about the radio is that the \"Band\" button is right there on the top with all the other buttons, so I need only hit the band button and my AM station is there.  This radio has every feature one would look for in a radio--even an automatic adjustable-timer shutoff so you can go to sleep with the radio on and have it shut off automatically.  The only drawback I found was that it only has a battery backup for 10 minutes should the electric go out.  There isn't a 9v or other battery that can be installed for longer memory time.  I'm not using it as an alarm clock, so that wasn't an important feature for me.  I don't know when I've been happier with a purchase."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I use a small radio in the bathroom just so I can hear the news, traffic, or whatever as I shower and get dressed. I purchased this to replace my 10 year old Sony Dream Machine which still technically works, but has an analog tuner and a weak antenna which left me assuming strange positions to avoid hearing static. For reference, I am in a mid-rise condo in the heart of Chicago and have been using this daily for about a month. This is my first experience with the Sangean brand.\n\nI can't comment on the alarm features as I don't use those, but reception is far superior to the old Sony and it picks up stations the Sony could not. The speaker is not great, but it's better than the Sony and easily loud enough to be heard in the shower so it's certainly adequate for my needs. The presets work as intended and I can connect my iPod via an audio cord. The display is large and easy to read and you can adjust the display brightness via a knob on the bottom of the radio; it's also nice that the on\/off button glows a bit for instant recognition.\n\nI didn't give it 5 stars because it's nice, but a little expensive for a basic radio IMHO."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: 18 Oct. 2013:\nWhen the backlight is adjusted so as not to be objectionably bright late at night, it's too dim during the day. There's no happy medium. One thumb down on the display!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Neat little radio, very good sound and I'm thrilled about the five presets...not easy to find a radio that does that, for some reason.  I looked in Target and Walmart, to no avail.\nMy only suggestions are: 1) change the button size for the alarms...so you can feel in the dark for station changes, but you won't hit the alarm by mistake.  2) the numbers telling the time should be much a bolder black.  However, overall, a good deal for the money..."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: The sound is excellent. The reception is excellent.\n\nProblem: the wire connecting to the plug is very weak. Shortly after purchase, the radio began turning off. The problem is the wire. If I jiggle it, the radio will turn back on again, but only for seconds, before turning off again.\n\nThe radio is a bit difficult to set, and all settings are lost when the wire disconnects, so every time the radio shut down I had to reset it.\n\nTired of pampering this shoddily made product. Buying a new clock radio.\n\nIt's a shame because, as mentioned, the sound and reception are the best I've ever had in a clock radio. It's a shame that Sangean sabotaged their own product by installing such a shoddy wire."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: The radio looks good, but it is smaller than the photo. This means a smaller speaker, with lower sound quality.\nSetting the alarm took a while to learn, but now it is useful as a radio alarm, & I expect to\nuse it for quite a while"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It's OK, but I might expect more features and options for a digital clock-type radio, like some more alarms (it has two), or some kind of electronic equalizer for the radio to make it sound a little better.  I've seen much better audio features in a $12 mp3 player.  The buttons are positioned symmetrically, which is OK, but I might have liked them positioned a little differently.  Still, it's OK for the price."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This product exceeded my expectations. I find very useful the option to set the alarm clock according to each day of the week. AM radio stations can be selected in steps of 10 kHz (and optionally 9 kHz) according to the characteristics of each country. The audio quality (mono) is more than acceptable for a clock radio. Very interesting the auxiliary output for speaker or headphones. In short, excellent quality \/ price and functionality."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: When I first received this product it worked relatively well. Now all I am getting is static and it will not pick up any station. This is the worst radio for the money that I have ever had to do business with. I would not recommend anyone purchasing this item. I also did not realize that it did not have a backup battery compartment when ever it's unplugged it loses all of the preset radio stations."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Very good rf performance, easy to use, Has convienient ear phone jack.\n\nno battery back-up but does retain settings for a limited power outage\nI wish the display could be dimmed"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is the second of these alarm clocks we have bought and both users love the gentle awake feature.  The clock also has a dial to set the brightness\/dimness so you can get that perfect.  There are dual alarms, waking to either the buzzer or radio (digital tune with dial for volume control).  Alarms can have daily or just weekday.\n\nUpdated July 2016 - we now own 3 of these clocks, still super happy with the feature set.  2 of the clocks unfortunately have lost the backup battery power, so when the power cuts the clocks reset.  There is no way to replace the battery...I opened one of the clocks up and there is a TINY coin-cell battery glued\/affixed to the circuit board.  Without a ton of motivation to pry it out, identify it, and then get it stuck back to the board you are without backup (which I am).  Have to change the review to 4 stars because of that as I think for a bedside alarm clock, a battery backup is very important."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: The radio is smaller than I expected.  Which is fine for my use.  But better to take measurements and see if this pillbox of a radio will \"fit in.\"  Also, the radio is not stereo.  Which is also fine for my use (and after seeing how small it is, stereo is out of the question!).  In this day and age one assumes any FM radio will be stereo.  Neither of these things was a downer for me, but can imagine this might disappoint\/surprise some.  In the end, $46 is high for this tiny, tinny (one 2 1\/2 inch speaker...) monaural clock radio.  And as others have mentioned, there is no REPLACEABLE battery to store settings--only a built-in 10 minute memory.  $30 would have been a fairer price in my book.  If it lasts 10 years I'll have no complaints.\n\nAddendum:  I will agree with another reviewer that to turn your alarm OFF you must depress a button until it BEEPS.  Loudly.  So say you need to get up at 3 AM and have set your alarm accordingly.  You wake up at 2:45 so have no need for the alarm.  To turn it off that loud BEEP  at 3AM will wake the dead.  (And your wife...)\n\nI see this radio is now $40 a week or two after I bought one...  Still, overpriced.  After 2 weeks of use I'd rather it had a large button to push to turn the alarm off.  AND...if your eyes are going bad, good luck deciphering the details like setting it to go off just on the weekends.  Or every day.  While it nicely SHOWS you which days you want it to alarm, only 20\/20 vision can see the days highlighted.  And with no glasses at night?  Hoo Haa.  This could all be forgiven at a $30 price point.  Maybe in another two weeks...\n\nDecember 10th:  The alarm no longer functions==cannot turn it on and off."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio has good sound - I usually listen to talk but OK for music.  Easy to operate, time easy to read, alarm good.  Size good - does not take up a lot of table space."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This digital radio alarm clock is just what I wanted. I found it very easy to follow the directions to set the clock and the alarm functions. Important for me was a clock that did not automatically follow daylight saving time since I live in Arizona. I also really appreciate being able to scroll forward as well as backward when setting the time. I love that you can have 2 different alarms programmed and they can be set either daily, week days, weekends or one time. You can awake to a preset radio station or beeping alarm. The radio is easily tuned with a digital tuner and there are 5 presets for storing favorite stations. The light is a warm amber back light that can be significantly dimmed for nighttime comfort. In the past with other alarm clocks I have always resorted to gluing a strip of vinyl sunshade window cling over the clock face to be able to tolerate the usually glaring light (even at its lowest setting) but not so here. Radio sound quality is above average for such a small clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this after getting sick and tired of buying a new cheapie clock radio every year or so. So far it has been very reliable. One of the default weekly alarm schedules makes it so you don't need to turn off the alarm every weekend. It's a nice feature, but obviously only useful if you work M-F.\n\nWhoever runs this company is obviously a music lover. The radio reception is quite good, and the sound quality surprised me. As a long time audiophile, this is important to me. I wasn't expecting much, and after all this is just a little clock radio with a tiny speaker, but it sounds as good or better than much more expensive 'high end' table radios I've heard. It does have a slightly laid back vintage type sound. I love this, but it might not be to everyone's taste.\n\nThe user interface is somewhat non-intuitive, and I actually needed to refer to the manual to set the alarm, etc. It's not horribly complex or anything, but worth noting. In my view things like this should be simple enough to operate without a manual. While this area could use improvement, overall it is so much better than other clock radios in this general price range, I consider it a minor inconvenience."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I have been through several terribly crappy alarm clocks and am so pleased to finally find the Sangean! The radio is super clear, the clock's time and alarm set controls are intuitive and easy. The display light dims to your liking and the sleep\/snooze features are great, too. If it would just make coffee, I'd love it more than my dog!"}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I regret not getting the atomic clock. Setting the dual alarms, resetting times, or wanting to shut off alarm ahead of time are much too complex.  Trying to decipher the direction manual is frustrating. Dimming of face light is a nice feature."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is by far the best sounding clock radio I have ever had. The PLL quartz tuning locks in FM stations and eliminates station \"drift.\" Over and above that, though, is the good quality speaker that has surprsing range for its size, And Sangean has employed a powerful enough amplifier that provides clean sound across that range. OK, it's not going to sound like your McIntosh tube amp, but I soon learned to appreciate waking up to broadcasts that didn't sound like your 3rd grade teacher dragging her claws across the blackboard. Took a second to figure out how to set the time and alarms, but after one go around it is  easily remembered. The only caveat I have with this product is that the time display is not very easy to see unless you are fairly close and looking nearly directly at it. Something about the orange backlighting washes out the LCD 7 segment displays no matter how you want to tweak the brightness setting. Which I alkso think would have been better served as a digital setting using the top buttons rather than a potentiometer underneath the radio. Still, trifles at their worst. Want to be awoken to sweet sounding music in the morning? This radio fits the bill well."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a very tidy and attractive device. The sound is excellent. One sleepless night I plugged in my i-phone headset and listened to opera on NPR. Very smart little radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Thanks to the other reviewers, I was aware of the particular quirks of this radio before I bought it. (The reviewer who noted how to dim the display with the button on the bottom of the radio was spot-on.) I was looking for a radio with good sound quality and reception, and an any-color-but-blue display. Bingo. This was it.\n\nWe live in an area with lots of interference. Clock radios were always a challenge for us, but the antenna cord is long enough for it to be put in the right place for a strong signal. I also don't like a lot of ambient light in the room, and dimmed all the way down, this clock radio is just perfect for me.\n\nA feature that I also like is the nap timer-- brilliant thinking, Sangean! No need to mess with your daily\/weekly settings if you just want to take a short nap.\n\nI don't need to have a fancy clock radio, and I don't have a lot of bed-side space. If you are looking for a solid clock radio and don't need the docking capability of other radios, this is for you (though you can still connect your MP3 if via a cable if you want to). Call me old school, but I just want to listen to music before I go to sleep and wake up to my favorite morning newscast. Simple is sweet!\n\nI went through three clock radios this year trying to find the right one. Now I am considering buying another one of these to have on hand when\/if the one I just bought gives up the ghost. Good price, great value."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The radio is nicely made and operates well except that the tuner lacks sufficient sensitivity to pull in our favorite classical music station unless the antenna wire is positioned just so, and just so is a decor problem.  WCRB has a weak signal but other table radios we have had in the past have been able to lock onto it, including a Sangean non-digital table radio on an upper floor."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This radio is well built.  The alarm works well.  The reception is adequate for this level of radio.  The nap alarm is good.  It is easily set."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I wanted a radio that had alarm clock features instead of an alarm clock with some radio features. This is a nice radio, pulls in stations and has good quality sound. It could use a longer time for power off backup. Shipping was fast."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I thought Sangean was a good brand, and the radio sure looks nice. But the light, which you can't dim, kept my wife awake. The alarm took 10 steps to set--so how could I trust it? And the radio reception (we live right near a big city) was crummy. I'm returning this piece of junk."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This item is fine.  I especially like the dual alarms and the nap feature (a count-down alarm).  Sound quality is fine.  It is nice to be able to plug in my M3P player and headphones.  I do agree with some of the other reviewers that programming the alarm is a little confusing and the multitude of buttons (all in a row) makes it a little difficult to press the right one when, for instance, you are just waking up and reaching over to turn off the alarm."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a real good radio alarm.  The receiver is strong for both AM & FM stations and the speaker sounds sharp and clear.  Controls are easy to use and function as stated.  I would recommend this product."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio lives up to its reputation in every way. It was recommended to me by a friend at Curves who uses it in her kitchen. My Sangean RCR-5 digital clock radio is located upstairs in the bathroom\/dressing room and it performs beautifully there. I chose to move it downstairs where I could listen to it for a longer time and was pleased to find that I was able to do this without losing the clock and channel settings."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was surprised with this radio. Very easy to set up and use. I will admit that is has some features that I will probably never use, but I am sure that other people will need the features. The radio has good sound for a mono system and will pull in even weak stations. A very good buy and the price can't be beat."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: I can't use the radio, the sound is so bad.  It took me a half hour to set the alarm\nand I  don't change it because I am unwilling to go through the torture a second time.\nI do like the gentle bird sound for the alarm, gradually increasing in volume and the\nfact that the alarm goes off every morning without my having to reset it.\nFor those two factors, I did not send it back, but the radio and clock could be\ngreatly improved."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I ordered this radio because of all the good reviews I read. They were right. It's construction is very good quality, the sound is good and I like the pre-setting of stations by pressing a button. The one issue I have is the display lighting.\nIt should be even less when turned all the way down, and the fact that the light turns on full when you press any button is really annoying at night. It would be nice if they had an on\/off switch under the radio (where the dimmer knob is located) that would turn this function on and off.\nI'd still recommend this product, however, because too often I buy something on line and find out that its built like a piece of you-know-what. This is an exception."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Surprisingly good sound for such a small unit and I would highly recommend it.  Some of the instructions in the manual would be easier to understand if the English was better (a pet peeve of mine).  And I would love a few more radio preset buttons but all-in-all it's a great little radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I usually purchase the cheap radios at the local box store. Several years ago, I treated myself to a Sangean portable so I could listen to mp3's ( using an SD card ). I was so impressed, when my last clock rang its last, I got the RCR-5. The AM reception, which had been barely tolerable on the old clock, was fantastic. The unit is easy to set up, works great, sounds great. It has a solid feel and is heavy enough so it doesn't slide around when I touch it. One note: the instructions are not really clear about dimming the illuminated numbers - turn the unit over and there is a small knob to adjust the light."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: For years we have struggled with an analog clock radio that had terrible reception. Finally, when it couldn't receive a signal with moving it around, we decided to upgrade.  I love the way we can dim the backlighting on the LCD screen.  I also love the digital tuner and the ability to zero in on a signal.  The antenna allows up to pull a strong signal from our favorite all news radio station, so we can get up or listen to traffic and weather before we go out any time of day.  Highly recommended."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio fits the bill. I needed something basic (AM\/FM) for my bedside. It has a small footprint, and most importantly it has a jack for a headphone speaker.\n\nThe dimmer feature for the display is nice - this is done manually (and does not adjust automatically to the lighting environment like on a Bose). However, if you put the radio on, the display momentarily brightens. This could bother a roommate if you fiddle with the radio during the night.\n\nThough I haven't used it, this also has a separate button for a \"nap\" alarm feature. So if you feel like stretching out for a while (with or without the radio on), you simple press the nap button for a set amount of minutes which will beep when time is up. I suppose this could also be useful as a \"reminder\" feature -- ex: if you are watching TV or reading in your room, and you want to remember to throw laundry from washer to dryer.\n\nThe time display includes seconds - which was different than other bedside clocks I've owned.\n\nI would add one more star if my reception were better -- but I don't think this can be attributed to the radio. It's a function of where I live."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I purchased this cuz I wanted a digital radio and a clock together....It is so hard to get my christian radio station in when I have to use a dial radio...this way i just scan for my station # and perfect reception !!!  Worth every penny.\n\nI have had this over 8 months now."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The Sangean RCR-5 was purchased primarily as a wake-up device to replace a much simplier, analog Sony clockradio that failed after 30 years of reliable service. There is no question the RCR-5 has all of the capabilites we want in a digital clock radio...AM\/FM capabilities, two alarms, and so forth. The availability of a short external antenna is a real plus, giving us the opportunity to 'pull in' a weak college FM station that plays jazz and classical music throughout the day and night (no commercials, of course).\n\nBut...setting up the RCR-5 can be a bit tricky, requiring a careful read of the manual and absolute adherence to the step-by-step instructions. And it's with respect to the latter that the wheels occasionally come off the wagon. I haven't seen a manual such as the RCR-5's since reading the ones provide with home entertainment equipment from the Far East in the 1970s. One would think that today, Sangean would have spent the money to have an editor clean up the English version (which is what I used) so that it didn't contain nonsense such as the examples below:\n\n\"Alarm setting can be done while the power is during ON or OFF position.\"\n\n\"c. The setting will automatically complete the setting after 30 seconds without any button pressed. But when the ALARM RADIO is under setting, it will not complete automatically until the TIME SET of POWER button is pressed.\"\n\nSuffice it to say you may have to read portions of the manual several times before you understand exactly what is being said and what you are required to do.\n\nTwo negatives:\n\n1. The radio has an internal battery back-up unit that only stores the clock and radio presets for 10 minutes. How much better would it have been to include provisions for two AA batteries! When the power goes out in our neighborhood, it's usually out for hours at a time.\n2. The ON-OFF button on the top, right side of the radio is no larger nor higher than the other buttons in the same row (though it is lighted internally). It would have been better to make it slightly taller so that it's easier to locate by touch in the dark for shutoff upon waking.\n\nAll in all, though, having set up and used the radio for more than a week, we are very pleased with its performance."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: After a lot of reviews on clock radio's I went with this one because of the digital radio tuner and dual alarm with day set. Works great and would recommend it for other's. Only thing I don't like is that you can't pick the days of the week separately, You can only pick Monday-Friday, Saturday an Sunday, or everyday. I work Sunday-Thursday so I have to set it for everyday and turn it of on Friday and Saturday. Radio work great and it has a wire antenna for reception."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a handy little clock radio.  Thanks to the antenna wire it picks up stations better than my old radio and I really like the preset station pushbuttons."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Wonderful overall size to sit on a nightstand or dresser edge next to your bed.\n\nQuality overall is better than I expected.  Fit and Finish is perfect.  Buttons depress with a fairly solid click-feel.  Little rubber feet underneath keep it nicely planted on any hard surface (wood, glass, stone, countertop,...).  Display is crystal clear.  Display brightness is easily adjusted with a dial peg underneath the unit (I don't know how the lowest setting could be too bright for anyone.....the highest brightness setting still doesn't pass for a night lite in my opinion).  The Display can be read perfectly clearly viewing at wide angles from left and right, or when looking down at it from above.  The Display fades from sight pretty quickly when viewing up from a head position below the unit.\n\nThe manual is more than adequate.  As others have noted, some words are poorly chosen.  That said, it is not that bad to get through.  When I saw the owners manual for the 1st time before opening it I kind of cringed a little since it was fairly thick, and I thought I was going to have a lot of reading for what seemed like should be a fairly simple alarm clock\/radio.  But after opening it I realized it was actually minimal reading and straight forward.  13 of the 70 pages make up the English language portion.  Plus it's all in Giant easy to read print and well spaced.  Of those 13 pages, most will only care about 9 pages, unless you really need to be told not to take a bath with it or other stuff relating to other countries.\n\nThe alarm is not super loud.  That said, for any light-normal sleeper it will be more than adequate.  Even for most heavier sleepers I think it's probably adequate since if it jives with you you can set one alarm for the buzzer and the other to go off on radio set to MAX volume.  If you only prefer to use the buzzer for an alarm setting, then even for regular heavier sleepers you'll probably want to pass on this unit.  For pretty much all SUPER heavy sleepers out there, you will more than likely need a louder alarm.  General FYI;  The buzzer setting for the alarm(s) does not really \"buzz\" at all, but rather \"beeps\".  Many will appreciate the HWS (Human Wake System) for the buzzer alarm setting (does not work for the radio alarm setting).  With HWS, the alarm buzzer starts out almost inaudible and progressively gets louder during the course of a minute, as which point it begins again and continues for another minute, and repeats the process for an hour (I didn't test it for an hour, so I am relying on their word, though if you are still sleeping after an hour from the time you set the alarm to go off I'm guessing you're day is pretty much ruined anyway).\n\nWhen using the radio as your alarm setting, whatever volume you have the volume control for the radio set at is the volume it's going to wake you up with.  Here's the potential problem with that for some;  If you choose to use the radio as an alarm, BUT you want to use the radio Sleep Timer to fall asleep, whatever volume you set the radio Sleep Timer at is the volume your radio alarm will sound off at.  In other words, if you set the radio sleep timer volume really low, that's the same volume the radio alarm will sound off at which may not be loud enough for you to reliably wake up when you need to.  Hope that made sense.  The snooze function (nonadjustable 5 minute interval for buzzer alarm) does NOT work for an alarm set to radio.  For an alarm set to sound with the radio station you have it set to, you must use the radio power button to turn it off.  Ultimately what's going on is the alarm set to go off using the radio simply automatically turns on your radio without you pushing the radio power button to turn it on yourself.  Therefore to turn off the alarm that sounded via the radio, you're simply pushing the radio power button to turn it off, just as you would turn it off when generally listening to the radio.\n\nThe manual is WRONG on how to shut off either or both of the alarms set on buzzer.  The manual says to press the appropriate alarm button (Alarm 1 or Alarm 2 buttons) and hold it down for 2 seconds at which time you'll hear a beep and the alarm should be deactivated.  At least on my unit this is NOT true.  On my unit when an alarm buzzer goes off, neither the alarm 1 or 2 buttons will beep or deactivate the alarm.  The only button on my unit that will turn off any alarm on any setting (buzzer or radio) is the general radio Power On\/Off button.  I have no issue with this in general.\n\nRadio Usage;  sound is good virtually all the way up to MAX volume.  I'm not saying it sounds like a Bose system but that's not what it is, and only a fraction of the cost.  Overall it has more than adequate sound quality.  I'll give radio reception a 4 out of 5, not because I really find issue with it as it pulled in all 3 stations (2 local, 1 not local) perfectly that I cared about, but that I've never owned a radio that I didn't want to have better reception for outlying areas (can't get the out of town AM station I was hoping for, but even my car will only pick it up sometimes).  MAX volume is enough for general radio listening throughout an attached kitchen\/living room area.  In a garage where you may also be doing some banging around and whatnot, you may want something with higher volume than this unit is capable.  For the vast majority that aren't interested in cranking up the music extra loud, volume levels will be more than acceptable in the home or out on the patio.\n\nLittle Things:  Love that it always shows the day of the week.  Wish it also always showed the date, but rather you have to push the display button twice, once for the year and a second time for the month\/day of the month.  General FYI, the radio power button is nicely backlit when the radio is OFF, no other button is, but when the radio is ON (generally or as an alarm) it is not backlit.  It does have a plug in space for headphones.  It does have an AUX IN plug-in space like for to plug in a portable CD player where you can then use the units speaker for sound.  It does not have any AUX OUT plug-in space which I wish it did to be able to plug in better right left speakers for those who want a little more sound, and that you could then aim directionally.  The unit is NOT stark white like the pictures imply (in my opinion) but is rather an off-white.  The gray on the rest of the unit is exactly as the pictures imply.  It came nicely packaged.  It has a built in battery backup that's good for 10 minutes of power outage.  I wish it had either a longer lasting (3 hour) built in battery or a space to put accessory batteries that would last much longer regardless (I live in Arizona where during the monsoon season it's not unusual for the power to be out for an hour or two a couple times a year or so).\n\nBottom line:  I feel this clock\/double-alarm\/radio is worth more than the money asked for.  I would highly recommend it for anyone to themselves or given as a gift, unless whoever is going to use it mainly as a wake-up alarm is a very heavy sleeper (where there's a good chance the alarm isn't loud enough) or simply needs a louder radio (for areas with lots of ambient sound or very large areas overall like a small warehouse environment...).  For anyone still sitting on the fence toward making the decision to buy or not, outside of possible given limitations I've noted, I would add a couple things;  1)  I could not find another product that remotely compared for the price (other than similar but different units from the same manufacturer), and 2)  It is not as difficult to initially set up as some make it out to be.\n\nOne last comment on turning off the alarms.  As noted earlier;  At least on my unit you do have to use the radio Power On\/Off button (a single quick press) to turn off either alarm, whether they are set to go off on Buzzer or Radio.  What I don't like when an alarm uses the radio to wake you up is that when the radio is on, the radio main Power On\/Off button backlight goes out.  So if it's still dark in the room at the time the radio alarm comes on you may have to search for the button till you get used to it's location to shut the alarm off.  It would be nice if it always stayed lit up whether the radio was on or off so it could still be clearly seen in the dark.  Also, some reviewers complained that they accidently pressed the main Radio On\/Off power button twice to turn off an alarm which on the 1st press turns off their alarm, and on the second press turns on the radio just as if you wanted to listen to it, which they didn't.  I don't see what the big deal is, as one more press of the same button turns the radio right back off again.  And, you have to press the button with firm pressure to completely depress it at all which makes it surprising to me that anyone is having issues double pressing it in the first place.\n\nSincerely hope this review helps you make an informed buying decision!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The radio is attractive, right size for a small night stand, and has easy to use controls.\n\nUnfortunately, the reception was terrible.\n\nI live 45 minutes from Manhattan. There are dozens of powerful AM stations in the area. I expanded the built in antenna, put it out my 2nd floor bedroom window, and yet was unable to receive with any AM station - amazing. I have several small portable radios that pulled in AM stations in the same location as the clock radio.\n\nI sent the radio back and plan to avoid Sangean radios in the future."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I'm not often given to superlatives, but for this product I'll make an exception. After a horrible experience with another brand (3 initials) and reading the generally favorable reviews of this clock radio, I decided to take a chance. I'd never heard of this brand until recently, but desperately needed to quickly replace another brand that died after six months.\n\nI was impressed from the moment I took this product out of the box. It felt solid, substantial; not like it was going to fall apart if breathed on too heavily. The overall construction appears well finished with no gaps or excessive flexing. The buttons also feel very solid, not flimsy at all. In the case of this radio, first impressions were just a hint of what was to come when I plugged it in.\n\nA quick perusal of the clear and well written instructions and I had the date and time set within a minute or two. Next came the real test - the radio. We live in a difficult reception area, in the foothills of a small mountain range upon which perch our city's primary broadcast towers. You might think that being so close to these towers, reception would be a piece of cake. It ain't necessarily so. Antenna patterns tend to radiate out more than down, so actually being so close our radio reception tends to be pretty spotty with only a few very static filled stations coming in at all, or at least it had been with every other clock radio my wife or I have owned while living here. Until now.\n\nHere is where this amazing little box shines, and shines blindingly. When I turned the radio on for the first time, quite honestly I wasn't expecting much. Per the instructions I held the tuning + bar in to initiate a scan. Within a few moments, I was treated to a sound I had not heard from a bedroom clock radio for many years - music playing clearly, without static, crosstalk or any other interference. Breathlessly I pressed scan again...and was again treated to a clear, static free station. I pressed one of the preset buttons to save the station, and continued my search, subsequently finding and saving four additional stations, all ones that I like, all clear, all perfect reception. Wow!\n\nWhatever Sangean has done to make this radio receiver work, they have done very, very well. The sound, while certainly not audiophile, is actually surprisingly good from the single 3\" top firing speaker.\n\nAgain, following the instructions, I set times for the two alarms. Here you can choose from all days, week days, weekend, or single occurrence. When choosing to wake to radio, you may also choose one of your preset stations for each alarm.\n\nSo far, I'm very impressed with the build quality, design, and radio reception of this clock radio. I look forward to many years of good service, and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an extraordinary value in a good looking, good sounding clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I wanted a clock radio that I could pre-set radio stations.  I wanted one that had a headphone jack so as not to keep my husband awake while I listen to Coast to Coast after midnight.  I wanted one with a sleep (or nap) timer.  I wanted it to be small by my bedside.  I wanted a digital readout with a pleasing backlight.  This radio has everything I need.  Just one little issue:  I would have liked a CD feature, but given a choice I prefer the headphone jack over the CD feature."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This was a great alarm clock radio. To set the alarm for Monday through Friday was easy and the display has adjustable brightness. The best part was how great the reception was."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This clock radio fits the bill in terms of size and functionality. I also like that the light can be dimmed down - which is a reason I chose it.  The radio signal is good and I live in a canyon so this is important.  The two drawbacks I see are that when you want to put it on the timer to turn off in 60 minutes, it emits a loud beep. This isn't so good when you don't want to wake anyone else up. Also, it has a \"nap\" function button which is right next to the power button. If you accidentally hit the nap button instead of the power button, it then sounds an alarm in 60 minutes to wake you up from your nap. I have done this a couple of times and I thought I had turned if off, and in fact it woke me up an hour later. So the button placement is not optimal when you are trying to turn it off\/on by touch.\n\nI would recommend it because the good features outweigh the bad - I would just eliminate the beep on the timer, and move the nap button somewhere else if I were making a perfect radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I had to return the radio...it went to all static on an important AM radio station that a very cheap radio would hold.\nThe FM was good.  The small, look-alike control buttons were inconvenient. It should have a better design for controls.\nI am sure that in some states\/locations this would be a good radio. I am from central NJ...A month later, I again bought the RCR-5..the static sgain occured on the same AM station to a lesser extent. It was tolerable, so I kept it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Easy to transition from AM to FM.  I love the preset station options and the digital tuning.  The earphone\njack is another great feature.  We are very pleased with this product."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Okay, it's just a clock.  But it replaced my older-than-dirt Sony Dream Machine, a very old alarm clock that I loved-dual alarms, programmable by day, sleep, snooze, digital tuning with presets.  I waited this long because I couldn't find anything with the same features as the Sony, not even the current Dream Machines, which are all analog tuning.  Why'd they do that?  Lost a happy customer--dumb.\n\nIn any case, in every way except one the RCR-5 is equal or better.  The reception is better--more stations and I didn't even uncoil the FM antenna.  Sound is as good or better (see first sentence).  The Sony's display was undimmable; this one is infinitely dimmable.  Setup is  more intuitive than the Sony, but I'll keep the manual nearby anyway.  I like that is has a sleep timer, but I liked the sleep timer on the Sony better.  It had a dedicated button with a tactile bump I could find in the dark from a variety of odd sleeping positions and press it the requisite number of times to drift off to sleep and have the radio shut off automatically after 15 minutes, my usual.  The RCR-5 requires you to press and hold the radio on\/off button as the 60, then 45,, then 30, etc. alternatives go by, releasing it when you get the one you want.  Which means I'll have to look at the bright display to manage it, which will force me to move and look and basically wake up more than I like to to do this.  Maybe this won't matter to most folks, but me no likey.  We shall see.\n\nStill though, an awesome alarm clock\/radio."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I live in close proximity to NYC and neither the AM nor FM band of the radio could find a single station. Not even \"hiss\" coming from the speaker. Tuner is totally defective. I own a Sangean Internet radio and bought this assuming it would be of the same quality - it fails."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excuse my excitement but seriously I have never been more satisfied with an online purchase.  It gets excellent reception, the speaker is small but has good sound, and the HWS is 1,000 times better than that annoying ear-splitting BUZZZBUZZZBUZZZBUZZZ every morning.  PLUS!  It has a DIGITAL tuner!  This clock radio is almost half the price of others with the same features.  BUY IT!  You won't regret it!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Good sound; does just what I want it to do - wakes me up at the proper time!  Easy to read clock - numbers are large but not too large.  Perfect fit for bedside table.  Very happy with it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Let's be clear - I don't use the alarm functions on this clock radio.  I just wanted a digitally-tuned clocked radio for my bathroom so that I could listen while getting ready for work in the morning, after showering, etc.  Digital tuning was important because it's so much easier to switch stations.  It needed a decent clock as well so I know what time it is on work mornings.  So far, I love this thing.  Decent workmanship (it seems so far), buttons work really well and the radio reception is exceptional - FM and AM.  The sound has a bit too much bass behind it for my tastes, but I've gotten used to it.  Thinking about the sound, the quality is WAY better than any other clock radio I've owned, even a high-end Sony one from several (ok, many) years back.  I would buy this again without hesitation and am extremely happy with my purchase."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am of a seemingly rare breed that is only interested in an \"FM Alarm Clock Radio\" for one thing - that it will wake me up to my favorite radio channel without static.  I don't care about different buzzers, that it projects or not, that it can recharge my iWhatevers... I don't care about the sound quality of said radio, how stylish it looks, if it can set its own time, if it has \"Humane Wake,\" etc.\n\nI just need it to keep time and wake me up to my station without static.  And my 28 year-old analog radio I probably bought at Drug Fair (antecedent to Rite Aid) stopped doing that.  I am happy to say, this clock does what I need... with an annoying quirk that isn't a deal breaker for me, but could be for you.\n\nFor the people that complain about it being too complicated or too difficult to program.... you either didn't read the directions or you are an idiot.  I found it perfectly user friendly so long as I read the directions.  A machine doesn't have to be \"intuitive\" if it comes with accurate directions.  It comes with adequate directions.  Read them.\n\nThe FM clarity was perfect - but I did have to fully deploy the little white antenna cord (I was hoping this was amazing enough that I could keep the cord discreetly coiled up next to the machine.  I don't care though... clarity was my goal here.  No static.\n\nI'm not going to write about all the other bells and whistles because I don't care about them and will likely never use them.  I will say it IS cool that I can set two different alarms, because it just so happens that I wake up at two different times during the week, depending on the day... that is nice.\n\nHere's the thing that might drive you crazy and be a deal breaker for you (it's not for me) - if you are nearsighted, and don't wear contacts or glasses while sleeping (who wears glasses while sleeping), you will not be able to see the time in the middle of the night unless you have the screen dimmer cranked up to flashlight-level bright and then it's about 50\/50 you will see it.\n\nThe good people at Sangean were smoking crack when they designed the opticals of this clock radio.  Viewing the digital readout is a function of how much contrast there is between the numbers and the background - not brightness of the entire viewing area.  You can adjust brightness but not contrast.  If you amp up the brightness to improve the contrast, it's too bright.  If you dim it, you lose contrast.\n\nSo in order to see the time at night if you are nearsighted, the clock must be no more than 2-3 feet from your face on the pillow no matter how bright you have it.  Period.  You will not see the time with it any further away, so don't even think about it.  If you think you will read the time from across the room, forget about it.  Now, with it that close to your face, unless you like sleeping like you're under interrogation in a Viet-Kong prison camp, you're gonna want to turn the brightness down to its lowest... then you can barely see the screen BUT ALSO THE TIME ALONG WITH IT.  You are forced to choose between the lesser of two evils.  This ultimately works out for me, because my clock sits about 2 feet from my face and as long as I squint at it in just the right way, I can still make out the time on it's lowest dim with my nearsightedness (I am -5.25 in both eyes).\n\nSo it works for me... I'll update if something goes wrong.  If you have perfect eyesight, you have no reason not to buy this clock, so just buy it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: We needed a replacement radio\/clock and this one has been great!  Works wonderfully and easy to use.  You can preset stations and it even counts down the minute, so you can time yourself when you brush your teeth."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I bought this because I would mostly be listening to public radio on this clock radio, and I wanted one with good reception. That part is wonderful. Two things I didn't realize, which might have changed my mind about purchasing are:\n1. There's no backup battery. There's a factory installed backup\/memory, but it only lasts for 10 or 15 minutes. We get a lot of thunderstorms in my area, and a lot of power outages at night, which means if we lose power at 1am my alarm won't be going off in the morning.\n2. When you set the alarm it makes a loud beeping noise. This isn't an issue if you are able to use the automatic settings (e.g., the same time Monday through Friday). But if you need to make a change, and you don't realize it until after your partner or spouse is asleep, you will likely wake him or her up."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: One of the best clock radio I have every purchased for the price.  I like the external headphone jack feature a lot, as I like to fall asleep with the radio on, and my wife does not like too much noise."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Does everything it's supposed to do. Was easy to set up. Small footprint on small table. Only 20 seconds slow in 30 days. I like the quiet to loud wake up beep. Can hear and understand news and weather OK. Still messing with screen brightness. If it lasts 20 plus years like old Panasonic, I'm happy."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This was a very good purchase.  Much better than anything you will find on the store shelf as far as the quality of the radio.  It tunes stations very well, and the AM band is very good as well.  For the more than casual radio listener this is a very good purchase."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I wish I had kept the packaging to return. The light it casts is a sickly yellow and the time can only be seen from a certain angle, so good luck seeing what time it is if you're on the side of the bed that has the wrong angle. My husband didn't believe me, so the next day, he looked at different angles and found that it was only viewable straight-on. Also, the beep sound to tell you that the alarm is set or not set is a pain because at times you want to unset it in the night and night wake spouse up. And it's overly complicated. We moved it to the kitchen and just use as a radio. Oh, and the radio sound is muffled and weak. Ugh."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Who would put seconds (in fairly large numbers no less) on an alarm clock.\n\nI can see myself watching the seconds tick by on nights with insomnia.\n\nSo far I like this clock though it is far from my ideal\n\nIt does have dual alarms and allows you to choose the days you want each alarm active.  However, how to set the alarm is not intuitive and I had to read (gasp) the directions to figure it out.\n\nI don't like beeping alarms and typically wake to radio.  The beeping alarm on this fits the description of humane alarm.  Loud enough to wake but not so irritating I want to throw the alarm clock against the wall."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Tuning works well, sound quality is good for a little box like this--controls are not too confusing, better than some.  The reason to downgrade it is that the display is almost impossible to read--it consists (as shown) of dark characters on a orange\/yellow background.  The other way around might be give better results, but in a dark room from 10-12 feet it is extremely difficult to read.  I see little excuse for marketing the device without putting it out to some sort of focus (a little joke there) groups for feedback."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I've owned one of these radios for some time, using it in my bedroom as an alarm, as well as a radio.  I have been so pleased with it, I bought another one for my family room, just to be used as a radio.  The size is very compact and the sound quality very good.  The setup process could be easier....time allowed to complete individual settings is too short, in my opinion.  Otherwise, I am very happy with both radios."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio had all the features I was looking for, at least as far as it could be discribed.  How do you discribe sound?  the sound is WEAK;  normal loudness, if near, is fine on its loudesrt setting, but cannot be heard in the shower. nice clean appearance and the night light it shows is just fine too."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is just a great clock radio.quality built.sounds great.easy to program. controls are easy to access. I love this machine. Light is not a problem being too bright. Love the way the light dims after using the controls. It picks up radio stations really well also. If your looking for just a well built,good clock radio, this is the one, Good price also."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: It is nice and classy, and I guess the sound is ok to be a clock radio. But the handling is complicated - I have never had to read a manual before to operate a clock radio. Also, it's not possible to change to 24h format even though it should be according to the instructions."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Bought this due to great luck with Sangean shower radio and because of difficulty in getting decent reception of two local stations, one AM and one FM.  By relocating the antenna wire both stations are now receivable.  But, this unit has some different controls.  Shutting off the alarm (on clock radio setting) is difficult as once the unit has gone off and snooze has been hit: the only way to turn the alarm off is to turn the radio on - then the button for disabling the alarm will work.  Strange.  Unit is decent but unusual in the way it works."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: After years of having a \"dream machine\" type clock radio, it was time to upgrade. The problems we wanted to solve: better tuner, better reception (yes, we do listen to AM now and then), less harsh light display. Having a digital tuner is a plus, as it allows station presets, so we can switch between stations and not have to retune a wheel. The reception is better, although there is still some fussing where to keep the antenna wire. The light display is orange, not blue, and is much less harsh in the middle of the night. As far as the instructions, we had no problems getting the various bells and whistles to work, and the basic alarm setup  (5 days for one setting, the weekend for the other - Different stations!) was easy and almost intuitive. A bonus is that the clock radio has the three features that go beyond just an alarm - snooze, nap and fall asleep to music. A terrific upgrade!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Works fine. We bought it so my mother-in-law could plug in her pillow speakers.  The sound quality is good.  She likes the large numbers."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I wanted a digital clock radio because there are so many stations in my area and with the usual dial station finder, I always had trouble getting the station I wanted to come in...works great! Thanks...."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I bought this due to its reviews for quality AM reception but the reception is poorer than my inexpensive Target purchased radio alarm clock.  I will be sending this back."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The clock radio does what I expected but has one feature which is bothersome. The unit has an output port for an audio headset which is one of the reasons I bought it. I wake up during the night and sometimes want to listen to the radio without disturbing my wife which I can do using the audio output. The clock radio has another good feature. It allows you do turn the light intensity way down. But, whenever you turn the radio on or select a new station, this light goes to full intensity which disturbs both me and my wife who is sleeping."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I like the sound quality of the clock radio.  Setting the date and time was easy but the alarm settings take lots of time.  Since I haven't yet had time to devote to the instruction book and \"trial and error\", (One Thursday morning, the alarm went off at 3AM),  I am not using the alarm feature at this time.  No big deal.  I bought the radio specifically for the headphone jack and \"nap\" setting.  I fall asleep to talk  radio and listen during the night when I wake and can't get back to sleep.  The radio volume turned low soothes my \"monkey mind\" and the ear buds allow my partner to sleep through."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Love the clock radio, can finally fall asleep to the radio, with timer, using the headphones without disturbing the hubby. Love the way the alarm starts out really quiet and then slowly gets louder, instead of jolting me awake. Easy to use while still asleep and dark, the sleep button, the radio button, etc. Never accidentally turn off the alarm while trying to hit sleep, etc."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This product offers more advanced features for alarm settings as well as the adjustable display light.\nI also like the fact that it uses a 6 volt power supply.  I am running it on a 6 volt solar power system."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a great mono sound radio. Controls are well done and a lot of basic options. It's difficult theses days to find a radion without a ipod dock! Great buy."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great radio. Has all of the features I wanted (specifically digital tuning) for a great price. However, I find the tone is a little too base for listening to AM talk radio. A simple two position tone switch would be a nice addition."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I have been shopping for a clock radio for a long time that had a headphone jack.  This radio has it and others features that I appreciate such as digital tuning and memory buttons.  It sounds good, too!"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The sound on this radio is much better than the cheap one I had before.  Setting the alarms takes some getting used to so don't lose the instructions.  I like that you can set up Monday through Friday alarms so the alarm doesn't go off on weekends if you forget to turn it off.  Also like the dual alarms. I was hoping the digital tuner and the antenna wire would bring in more stations but it does not.  It will not pick up the 40 to 60 mile distant stations that I can get on my old boom boxes."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: It may just be my aging ears, but I think this radio is somewhat lacking in high frequency response.  Also, I have not had an opportunity to test it under conditions of multi station interference on either FM or AM.\n\nI have it on a bedside table just under a lamp that has a CFL bulb in it.  The bulb puts out significant interference on the AM band, so the radio is useless, (not the radio's fault, however) on AM with the light turned on.  The CFL lamp designers could remedy this simply by installing a single capacitor in their bulb, but that might cost them an additional penny or two at the wholesale level."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This is the clock radio I've been waiting for.\nPros:\n-Headphone jack.  This is huge for me. I've been looking for this on a clock radio for many, many years. Prior to this clock radio, I had a 1980's boom box propped up next to the bed with an earphone bud so I could listen to the radio as I fell asleep without disturbing my wife. I had tried small portable radios, but they all used batteries only and were too easy to fling around while I was sleeping. This radio is stable enough that I haven't yanked it off the nightstand.\n-Digital tuning with presets. Another problem with the 1980's boom box was the manual tuner knob. Too much fiddling with it in the middle of the night and often unsure if I had landed on the right station. My previous clock radio did have presets and digital tuning but no headphone jack, so worthless. On this radio, I usually switch between one AM and one FM station overnight, so switching back and forth only means pressing the \"band\" button at the front right, which is easy to find at night. If I had to find the presets in the middle of the night, that might be trickier as they're in the middle of all the buttons, but I figure I could always apply some kind of raised stickers (like Braille) on those buttons to be able to find them.  Also, concerning buttons, I have not had a problem accidentally hitting the nap button as some have mentioned. When I turn on the radio or turn off the alarm, it's been easy enough for me to locate that one in the dark as it's lighted red and is on the edge of all the buttons (back and on the right).\n-Variable display dimmer. My previous clock radio only had a high and low setting. High was a headlight, low was too dim. Problem solved.\n-Humane waking system. Love this. We gave away another clock radio that had only one setting - induce heart attack. I usually turn off the Sangean alarm at the very beginning when it's still very quiet, but I have been very tired some mornings and needed the extra graduated volume. I let it go to the loudest volume once and I found it to be loud enough for me.\n-Cost and size. Not too expensive I thought, and doesn't take up too much room on the nightstand.\n-Seconds display. When I look at the clock and it reads 5:59 am, I like to know if I have almost one minute to close my eyes or one second. My only complaint here is that when the radio is on (as mine is all night), \"ON\" is displayed instead of the seconds.\nA few minor complaints:\n-Yes, setting the alarm is tricky at first, but in a day I was used to it. To set the alarm time, press the \"1\" or \"2\" alarm button on the back briefly (at first, I kept making the mistake of holding it down for a few seconds, which turns the alarm on or off). This will display the current time set for the alarm. Once the alarm time is displayed (and it goes away in a few seconds if you don't do anything else), then press and hold the \"set\/display\" button until the hours start flashing. Then use the tuning  +\/- buttons to change hours, hit \"set\/display\" again, then the same +\/- for minutes, days of the week, type of alarm. Then to turn on or off the alarms, you press and hold the \"1\" or 2\" buttons.\n-Very loud beep when the alarm is turned on or off. OK, this is annoying if my wife has already fallen asleep and I forget to set the alarm. Same thing if I wake up before the alarm and want to turn it off before it goes off. This should be fixed. Either no beep or a very quiet one would be better.\n-The display changes to VERY bright whenever you do just about anything to the clock radio in the middle of the night (change the band, change the preset, turn the radio on or off). Again, this seems like it could and should be corrected.\n-Radio reception. Not a problem for me as the stations I listen to come in just fine, but one station I used to occasionally listen to (and used to be able to pick up) doesn't come in. I imagine it could be a problem for some.\nDespite the minor complaints, I'm still giving this clock\/radio 5 stars."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Purchased this radio because it had what i wanted in a nightstand radio. Small, FM, alarm, decent reviews. Seems to live up to my expectations so far."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I needed to replace my \"atomic\" alarm clock because it was a huge source of frustration that lacked accuracy and seemed to auto set the time to whatever if felt like when it felt like. After purchasing a new clock radio from a local store that proved to be a colossal piece of junk that I quickly returned I was on a quest to find a good quality NON ATOMIC clock radio with good AM reception, digital tuning, clock lighting that is not so bright it lights up a room, dual alarm and last but not least it had to have aux. in and ear phone options. The Sangean hit all my wants and expectations and then exceeded them. The fully adjustable back light allows you to find the sweet spot for your liking. It has easy to set pre-set buttons. The dual alarms offer flexibility (one time only, M-F, etc) and the Humane Waking System where the alarm progressively gets louder and louder is icing on the cake. The nap timer is a nice little bonus. Heck, I even like the color it is a nice little touch to set itself apart from the competition.\nSome reviewers stated that setting the time and alarms is not intuitive enough and is difficult to set. I am by no means a \"techie\" but my old VCR's never perpetually flashed 12:00 either.  I found the user interface simple to use and after referring to the manual to initially set the time and alarm I will no longer need to do so, it's rather basic stuff.\n\nI highly recommend this clock radio especially if you are fed up with the junk alarms found down at your local box stores. Dollar for dollar, the quality & value you get for this price is superb.\n\n1\/14\/13 Edit to Add: I went to turn on my radio last night before bed and lo & behold the screen was dark as was the lighted power button, no radio, nothing worked, my great new radio up and died. I have already initiated a replacement through Amazon. I am not ready to give up on this radio over this incident, hopefully it was a fluke and I just happened to receive a defective unit. My fingers are crossed the replacement will offer me years of use."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This was a Christmas gift for my wife, so I did a little online research on the Amazon.com website before buying. I read the reviews and was satisfied that it would be a good purchase. I am very impressed with this Sangean RCR-5 Clock Radio. The set-up was very easy, if you just follow the instructions, and it did not take a lot of time. I like how the hour, minutes AND seconds show on the digital face. You have plenty of flexibility in how you set the 2 alarms, the nap timer, and the sleep timer. If you want to wake to the radio, you can select the radio band (AM or FM) and the station, and select two different stations for Alarm 1 vs. Alarm 2. We like the \"Human Wake System\", which is the buzzer alarm mode - the beeps start off low in volume and progressively get louder in volume for one minute, then silent for one minute, and repeat the cycle for one hour. The sound from the radio is clear and crisp. You can preset 5 AM and 5 FM stations. All of the settings are accomplished with buttons, with 2 exceptions - you have a volume wheel on the side and a small display-brightness knob on the bottom of the unit. The unit has a small footprint, and fits nicely on the counter in our bathroom (my wife needs distance between the bed and the alarm clock radio so the snooze button isn't so easy to hit). The power cord has a small transformer plug-in at the wall. All in all, we, and most importantly my wife, are very happy with this Sangean RCR-5 Clock Radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It appears Sangean has taken over where Sony left off.  Sony used to make great clock radios, but their current line-up has only (yes, I know there are a few exceptions) cheap looking, analog - non digital tuning radios. For about $45, this is a good clock radio with a few shortcomings and some nice features.  I selected an AM\/FM radio for reliability.  We don't listen to the radio in the bedroom, so the primary purpose was to wake us up at a specific time.\n\nPROS:\nClock and Alarms easily set - time can be adjusted up AND down from the 'snooze' bar.\nTwo configurable Alarms - with radio OR 'buzzer' but NOT both at the same time\nDigital tuning with Presets for both AM and FM.\nBoth AM and FM seem to have good sensitivity.\nSmall footprint - fits your night table without overtaking all the space.\nWhite case blends nicely into our bedroom, which has white furniture.\n\nCons:\nTinny radio sound.  I've seen some reviews that say the sound is GREAT - they must be tone deaf.  Sorry, this sounds like a cheap table radio - hmmm, well it is only $45.  If you want great sound buy a Bose.\nDigital readout has 'dated' look and the dimmer is adjustable, you have to turn the radio over to get to it. It does not automatically adjust to the room's ambient light.\nManual says backup battery only lasts 10 minutes.  I guess that will be fine for momentary power glitches, but anytime longer will require resetting time, alarms and radio presets.  We don't get a lot of power outages, for us that might not be an issue.\nAlarm adjusting will require reading the manual, not very hard, but not intuitive.\nIt will display Year, Month, Date, but it requires pushing the Clock Adjust button numerous times to see each.\n\nOverall, as noted, I gave it 4 stars.  It does what it's supposed to do, and the price is pretty much on par with the features and performance.\n\nAdded Jan, 2013 - I've had a few months to use this radio and need to add a few comments:\n*Turning OFF the alarm makes a LOUD ANNOYING BEEP - I seem to be able to be up before my alarm goes off, but turning off the alarm emits a very loud BEEP which disturbs my wife - she likes sleeping a bit later than 5:30am.  Also, touching any button puts the LED at full brilliance, lighting up the dark room.  A ambient light sensor for the LED would have been better.\n*The LED is an OLD, cheap type that requires looking DOWN, rather than UP to see the numbers clearly.  So if your night table is higher than your radio, you won't be able to see the numbers very well - If it's lower than your bed NO Problem.  Seems upside down, as I believe most night tables are LOWER than the bed.\n* Human Sleep Alarm, starts low, gradually increases, only works on the BEEP Alarm NOT the Radio.  You will get blasted by the radio whether you like it or not, or take the chance, if set too low, to sleep through the alarm.\n* Just about all the buttons are similar in size, so it's hard to differentiate between them in the dark.  It would be nice if the ALARM OFF button was bigger and placed closer to the front where you could reach it easier.\n* If I could I would re-rate this at 3 Stars."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I just needed a bathroom clock radio w\/plug for Iphone or other devices. I didn't want a docking station since Apple controls the plugs. This radio fit the bill and it has great sound that can be heard over the shower even with the fan on without distortion. I wondered where it was made but could see no designation. Miracle - it must be made in the USA!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I agree with the other reviewers who rate this highly: excellent sound quality and reception. I did have to try different antenna placement for optimal reception as it is near a lamp with a CFL that interferes; but once I found the right place for the antenna (which is a very thin white wire that I don't find bothersome being visible), the reception was much better than any other radio (even less CFL interference than my Bose!)\n\nI saw few other comments about the compact size: it's quite small and that's nice in a bedside radio. I could wish the power button was a slightly different size so easier to find when sleepy... but that's easy to learn.  Another nice feature is this can be adjusted to a *very* soft volume (and still be heard clearly due to fidelity): nice to be able to use as alarm or late listening without disturbing others. This is the first clock radio I've had with preset buttons: this is a nice feature: very easy to sleepily change stations if the pre-set one is not what you want to wake to... or need some \"white noise\" to cancel out sleep-disrupting noise.\n\nI'm not as fond of having the time (numbers) backlit instead of the numbers being the lit area: so much more area that glows... and I'd prefer a softer color than the orange, but being able to change the intensity level allows it to be not too intrusive to sleeping. The numbers are also really big (helpful for the vision-impaired, like me who take off glasses and have to squint in bed). Somehow, the photo doesn't do the actual small size but readable numbers, and the overall appearance justice (the white plastic is quite glossy, which you can't tell in the photo, so it looks \"higher end\" and \"techier\" than I expected): it just looks and \"works\" much better than I had visualized even seeing the photo, once on the bedside table.\n\nAltogether an excellent bedside clock radio.\n\nUPDATE: after a month or so, I have to say the brightness of the orange backlit panel has become a problem: it actually seems to wake me up if I roll over and face right into it. I keep ending up putting a paperback book in front of it to block the light, so I no longer can just look over to see the time. I really wish this had just lighted numbers not a big bright panel of orange light: really bad design flaw. Nonetheless, the rest of the radio functions remain excellent.\n\nUPDATE #2: now after living with this for several months, I do have two large complaints: the light has become bothersome enough that I've ended up blocking it out with a paperback, which means to read the time I really have to wake up enough to navigate rearranging the bedside table: not what you want from a bedside clock! And several times I've inadvertently hit the \"band\" button which is stupidly placed right in front of the off\/on button and the same size: clock radios should be designed for use when semi-conscious... Two rather serious design flaws have made me reduce my rating. Still: lovely fidelity as seems a hallmark of this brand."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I have just had this a couple of days, but here are my early impressions: As a dual alarm it is perfect. Easy to set and use. The nap button is great, and can be set up to 120 minutes. Any more nap than that and let's call it sleep!\nThe adjustable light is great. I don't like to easily see my alarm clock if I get up in the middle of the night, and this can be turned way down. The button to do that is on the bottom.\nAs a radio it is no better or worse than any other radio, with a nice digital timer, 5 presets for AM or FM, and good sound for such a compact unit. It's no Cambridge soundworks, but it also does not cost nearly as much either.\nThe only reason I am not giving this a five is because of the lack of presets. 5 is a bit less than I like. It is an almost perfect, simple and easy to use radio. Instructions to set it up and use were well done."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Bought this to replace an older radio that worked well until my husband knocked it over (but he was vacuuming, so that's ok!):  no - that's NONE, 0, zero - stations would come in, no matter what we tried.  There's a very strong FM station with a transmitter 3 miles from the house - couldn't get it!\nAnd another reviewer was right:  there's no way to set the alarm without the manual, and even then, for example, you have to hold a button for 2 seconds and heaven help you if you linger for 2.5!  Back to the start - again.\nEssentially, this did not function as a radio, or a clock radio, and I've returned it.  Hope the company refunds my money."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I wanted a clock-radio with digital tuning and pre-set buttons and couldn't find one in stores. This clock-radio has an adjustable brightness display, which I love, the audio quality is fantastic for the price, and it has digital tuning with available pre-sets AND an aux-in jack, so I can connect my iPod if I want to. Very happy customer."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is one of the only good clock radios out there left to buy. My old RCA finally quit on me and I had to find a new one. I discovered that most of the new clock radios out there have a mandatory iPhone dock, cheap, tiny buttons and completely unintuitive designs. After searching for weeks for a decent replacement with no luck, my wife found this on Amazon. The Sangean RCR-5 has everything one could expect in a clock radio. It looks good, is intuitively designed and is built solidly.\n\nAs for the people that are saying it is too complicated to operate, let me just say that they are wrong. The design of this clock radio is very intuitive. I will even explain how to set the alarm in one sentence:\n\nPush the alarm button, press and hold the set button for 2 seconds, press the set button again for each desired setting - hour, minute, etc.\n\nIt's that simple. All of the settings have this logic and procedure. All the buttons are laid out on top in an easy to remember grid. Once you know where the buttons are, you don't even have to look at them.\n\nThe sound quality is surprisingly good. The reception is great if you use the antenna wire properly (try tacking it up the wall a bit).\n\nIf you are looking for a good clock radio without all the iPhone docking nonsense, this is the one to buy."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This radio does all I want even though I have not used all of the features. I bought this radio because I wanted an earphone jack and sleep timer for the radio. Once you get used to the button locations and what they are for it is easy to operate even in the dark. Very happy with this purchase."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I bought this because I was looking for a clock radio with a digital tuner.  The radio is ok -- the reception isn't great, but if I move the antennae around my stations come in fine.  But the rest of the alarm clock is incredibly annoying.\n\nSetting the alarm is not at all intuitive.  I can do it, but each time I want to change the alarm I have to consult the manual.  I thought after a few months of owning the clock, the controls would start to make more sense, but they just don't.\n\nThe snooze button is kind of hard to push.  You really have to find the exact right button, then apply direct pressure down -- but only in the center of the button.  (By contrast, with my old clock you could just slap a very large button in the front, and it would snooze.)  If you press on the right or left side of the button, you change the radio station and then the snooze option is gone, as far as I can tell.\n\nIt only snoozes for just under one hour.  If you are the type of person who snoozes the alarm several times before waking up, you really do risk oversleeping.  I have, a few times now.\n\nThe alarm options are either every day, weekdays, or weekends.  There is no M\/W\/F option - with electronics these days, it shouldn't be outrageous to just set what days you want it to go off.\n\nOverall, the functionality is just blah.  I gave it two stars because it does actually work, it is just poorly designed."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: Why make it so complicated when it could have been so simple.  To much push buttons, once, twice, one more time, for a week, two days, once, music, buzz, the date,......\nCannot just set the wake-up , for once, on or off.\nOr just a setting wheel, or and on-off for the fonction.\nWould not buy again.\nAnd the antena is not the ac cable.\nIf not at the right place, lots of noise."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I wanted a bedside clock radio with presets, and that's what I got.\nI like the form of it, its a nice size, not too big. The reception is very good.\nI'm not fond of the orange display,though I do like the dimmer function.\nWould have liked a countdown on the sleep timer, had it on my old radio and really liked it.\nAs said in other reviews some buttons are indistinguishable from one another, occasional press of the wrong button as such, not a big deal for me.\nProbably the biggest issue imo would be the alarm, even when it gets up to full volume on the buzzer it isn't very loud,\nI certainly would not rely on it, which is why I use my cellphone as a backup, so once again not a big deal for me.\nBasically I just use it for listening to the radio while I drift off to sleep.\nOverall I'm pleased with it"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am happy with this purchase. It does everything I wanted it to do. I had to spend an extra $20.00 NZ to get a NZ compatible plug. I never thought about that. But I am happy thanks Sandi M"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I like the ease of operation and sound quality.  A good buy.  Only thing I would change is adding a different color for the \"nap\" button so I wouldn't keep hitting it in the dark."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: pros: great sound in radio, like the beeping alarm\n\ncons: buttons hard to find when sleeping, they feel the same. hard to read the time....not enough contrast"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I really needed a good quality clock radio with a digital tuner and this seems to fit the bill. Nice features and soound (not tinny) It took a little while to get used to the slightly complex settings\/operations. All in all, very satisfied"}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This radio has every single thing I was looking for but one small thing. (Otherwise I would give it 5 stars).  I wanted a radio, made elsewhere than China, for the least amount of money, that looked nice, was durable, had a MP3 output, a dimmer mode, a sleep timer; and I couldn't be happier with this radio. The features involving all those things are just luxurious.  Things were well-thought out. I can't believe how great the cost for how great the quality. It even feels substantial.  The only thing I would request is that there be no sounds when setting the alarm; or at least a mode that allows that.  I have to remember to set the alarm BEFORE my husband goes to bed, or I wake him up with the beep the clock radio makes when setting the alarm."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The dimmer on the light is what really makes this for me- I usually point bedside clocks towards the wall after getting annoyed by the brightness. This clock has a dimmer dial taking the back light down to 0- just above zero is perfect for making the time visible in pitch black without being too bright. The downside of the dimmer is that it's a small dial on the underside- I'd prefer something on top to adjust the clocks brightness for daytime and back easily, this dial seems designed to be set and left alone. Like all Sangean's the build quality is high, but for $40, you'd expect that. The plastic is thick, the buttons and dials all feel solid, and the overall this seems very well made. My two main qualms with the clock are the inability to not view seconds (I just find the constant movement annoying) and the lack of decent AM reception (the FM reception is great)."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Looking for a small bedside radio with 2 alarms and ability to turn itself off, so I can go to sleep listening to music.  Works well.  Would like a better antenna."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Excellent  reception.  Sound is about what is to be expected from a small radio.  Setting the alarm is unnecessarily complicated.  I use the alarm that is built into my TV set instead.  Keeps time very accurately. Not sure why there isn't a 'real' battery back up but only a 10 minute one -- an important feature of a clock radio.  One thing that is possibly a poor design is the push buttons. They make a cheap 'click' noise and is probably what will send it to the landfill before anything else.  It is one of the best looking clock radios in its price range, but it is an off-white color, not brilliant-white like in the pictures, if that matters.  I definitely recommend this item."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The digital display is bright and the preset stations make changing stations an easy task.\nI am very satisfyed with the purchase of this item.\nThanx amazon and Sangean!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Everything came in great,on time,packaged properly. All the features were as explained. The reason why I only gave 3 stars was because the radio reception should be much better. I do get some stations somewhat clearly but even FM does not come in clear. The FM antenna is almost no help. Wish reception was better, don't know how to fix."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is EXACTLY what I was looking for!  This sits by my computer at my desk.  The antenna gives me clear reception of my radio stations.  I can preset five FM stations and five AM stations and have them available at the press of a button.  The clock has large numbers, easy to read when it's dark or when I'm getting glare from the window.  Everything is very easy to set up.  I couldn't be happier with it!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am very happy with this alarm clock. It has a lot of features and also allows for adjusting the brightness of the digital clock. Also, the radio sounds pretty good for it's size, if you like to wake up to the sound of music."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: We have been trying to use this clock-radio for the local NPR stations, but the selectivity of the FM tuner is not up to the task. The more powerful FM rock and roll stations just overwhelm the tuner. Careful adjustment of the FM antenna wire helps some, but not enough.  I think we have to try another clock-radio.  Our old Boston Acoustics Solo did much better, before it died."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: An excellent radio with all the bells & whistles. However, it has a very bright display and dimming it produces intolerable static on the AM band.\n\nSangean support says this is \"normal\" so I had to return it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I really like this alarm clock a lot except that after you dim the display to the lowest setting, it still casts an annoying yellow light in your bedroom.\n\nOther than that the sophisticated functions are great and the alarm setting isn't really that difficult for anyone who's used to gadgets."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Pros:  I bought this clock radio to replace an Emerson Smart set that I got cheap at Target.  It used to have good reception, but something happened.  This new clock has excellent reception for those pesky hard to tune in NPR stations.  It also has push buttons for your favorite stations which I like.\n\nCons: It's hard to see at night, and especially for my husband way over on the other side of the bed and without his glasses.  The Emerson has a black background and red LED lights - big - that are really easy to read and don't give off too much extraneous light.  This guy is backlit which is controllable but that means you've got a glowing yellow light right next to you all night.  And, my husband can't read it from the other side.  What's so hard about the LED concept?  I ended up leaving both radios on the nightstand, one for viewing the time, one for the radio.  Also, the way you operate it is a little tricky but once you get it, it's handy.  A little like learning a new software program.  Would I get another one of these?  Probably.  Hope the Sangean lighting engineers are reading this."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this radio as a replacement because living within in a mile of a local airfield makes AM reception iffy at best with an analog tuner.  The digital tuner has much better reception and is easy to program."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I have had this clock radio for a couple of years now.  It does have the nice digital radio station tuning, but the station buttons are the middle 5 of 9 in-line buttons.  So you have to count the first two buttons in the row to find the tuning buttons.\n\nAs one reviewer pointed out, they had to consult the manual to do the simplest thing like changing the alarm time.  I find the \"sleep\" turn-off and nap modes just too complex to use without the manual.  Every other clock radio I used had a single button you could push to give you an hour of radio, then turn off.\n\nWhy did I throw the Sangean across the room?  On a recent night I must have hit the wrong button going to bed.  Just after drifting off to sleep the darned thing started beeping.  I pushed a couple buttons but could not stop it.  Not having very good cognition in that sleepy state, I chose the only option available.  I picked up the radio and tossed it.  But it was still beeping so I located its power supply and unplugged that.  There, silence.\n\nSuffice it to say that I am looking for another clock radio.  If there were one with the simple controls of my 20 year old GE, but had electronic tuning instead of the GE's analog dial, I would buy it in a minute.  One should not have to be fully awake, reading a manual to perform basic functional operations on their bedroom clock radio."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: recvd the clock radio in good shape - alarm & radio worked fine -  but after about a month the digital clock started losing time - about 5 mins per week - it was out of the sellers return period so i am in the process of returning to sangean"}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Bought this radio to listen at night while in bed, mostly talk and news shows  I was impressed by all the reviews, and thought the price was decent.  When I tried it out I was so disappointed at the 'tubby' sound, and had difficulty understanding the dialogue. My cheapie 12 year old radio had better accoustics.  So I returned it.  I must add kudos to Amazon for the ease of the return.  Anyway, maybe I just got a lemon.  But that's just my experience with it."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Had an older analog radio with an awful \"indiglo\" clock and needed to replace it. Read the reviews for the RCR5 and felt for the modest $$ that it would be a good replacement...very similar features to a SONY Dream Machine we have in another room.\nPros...nice and compact, pll digital tuning, nicely lit and legible clock, decent sound, aux input.\nCons...not crazy about the gray colored side panels, but just a minor issue. Only 10 minute internal battery backup...never heard of such a limited backup time\nOther..some reviewers mentioned about confusing\/complicated alarm setting procedures...the procedure itself is not overly complicated, however following the written instructions for the first time that include some awkward \"chin-glish\" translations can make the experience a little frustrating.\nOverall, quite happy with the RCR5 so far and would have given 5 stars except for my cons."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Just what I needed - no bells or whistles.  My only complaints are that it doesn't have battery back up and is hard to read from far away (unlike a clock where the numbers are bright green \/ red).  Other than that, I like the ability to set the clock for only weekdays.  That's it's best feature."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Very pleased with radio, sound is great, the alarm goes from a gentle wake up, then more and more urging as time passes. Love the Mon-Fri alarm clock feature too."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I got this because I needed a radio with digital tuning in order to keep multiple religious stations from crowding out public radio on a former radio that could not stay on the station. There weren't many choices for digital-tuning clock radios so I took a chance on this.\nBut I agree with reviewers who said they found the steps needed to set the alarm to be too complicated and confusing. Indeed, I found the setting of alarms not only confusing and ridiculously complicated, but the manual's directions don't even match what actually happens when you follow them in an attempt to set an alarm. I have never succeeded in getting the combination of type\/time of alarm on certain days of the week.\nI will be sending this back."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This little radio is awesome.  You would swear it's stereo, but it actually only has one speaker.  The sound quality is very good.  The digital tuning is excellent.  It's very compact too...the sound is much better than of the one speaker clock radios in the $17-$25 price range.  Buy one, you'll love it.  Sangean makes a good product."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was sorry to return this mostly nice clock.\nGood things:\n- Good AM FM sound and tuning\n- Alarm goes off even if you have the radio on (can lay in bed in the morning listening to the radio, and the alarm will still tell you to get up)\n- Nap alarm\n- Nice size and style\n- Functions quite intuitive. You can guess how to set stations, set alarms, etc.\n\nIssues:\n- Automatic clock setting didn't work for me (that would have been nice). This might be location dependent.\n- Alarm clock setting very nice for those who get up at the same time several days a week, but a bit fussy for those of us who rise at a different time every day.\n- As with most electronics, too many identical buttons. This radio was better than most in having a wheel for volume, a bar for -\/+ and buttons on the front and top.  The top and front buttons, however, were difficult to work without looking at them to see what they did.\n- Date display not particularly useful, and takes up way too much of the display box.\n\nFatal Flaw:\n- The display box is highly back lit.  I don't know why.  It would be much easier to read without the back light.  Also, the back light is so bright it lights up the room at night.  Yes, you can turn the display down, but the digits become unreadable long before the display is dim enough to sleep next to.\nI had to turn the clock away to sleep, and if I wanted to know the time at night I had to rotate the clock back.  I called the company to see if this was a flaw or if I could turn off the back light and they said no.  Not being able to read the clock at night without having to reach over to fiddle with it was just not worth it, despite it's many other excellent features.\nThis was the one and only reason I returned the clock.  I haven't found a replacement.  Suggestions?"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great clock radio. Simple and elegant with all the required features - preset, snooze, auto timer off, decent signal strength ( not great !! ) . The\nbest part is the illumination setting. You can have it bright enough to check the clock, yet - no so much to bother your wife or yourself. For the price at $40, you cannot really ask for anything better !!!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am generally satisfied with this item and my complaints were covered thoroughly by other buyers in previous reviews but I'll share my quibbles anyway.\nI've never had a backlit clock radio before and have concluded that they are less than ideal - I would rather the numbers be lit and on a dimmer because they are easier to read day and night.  And why is the dimmer dial on the bottom of the product instead of the side and so tiny?  I have slim fingers and it's a bit of a stretch.\nI live in a radio signal hole and as expected several of the stations I was hoping this radio would pick up are pure static.  Disappointing.\nThe button design could be more tactile friendly but considering I use this daily I pretty much know the layout by touch now.\nOther notes, this is more attractive and modern looking than I expected which is a good thing and I really like that when the radio alarm comes on in the morning it is not preceeded by a loud click which nearly all of my clock radios of the past have done - the radio is just suddenly on and I am not jolted awake.\nI think that covers it.  I urge you to read through everyone's reviews to decide what you can and can't live with.  I can live with the things I'm not crazy about."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I had been looking for a radio with pre-set station buttons----not an easy task.  After wasting time in stores I found this one on Amazon.  I'm really impressed with the reception and function of this radio.  Because of the excellent reception I'm able to listen to stations I couldn't with my previous radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I;ve gone through 4 radios looking for one that could sit on my nightstand.  One had two dimness settings -- lighthouse or totally dark.  My wife couldn't sleep with the bright setting and I couldn't read the time on dim.  This clock has variable dimness -- set it at whatever balance works.  Another was too complicated and had too many buttons.  Half asleep when I turned off the alarm, I'd always accidently hit some other button causing the alarm to go off at some unscheduled time, like 3:00 am.  Once you get this clock programmed, you essentially do everything with the same button.  So uncomplicated.\n\nIt's an attractive addition to the room.  My entire family marvels at how cute it looks.  Nice sound and good reception (I've read some reviews complaining about the reception.  As far as I can tell, all you need to do is adjust the antenna wire).\n\nI am very happy with this purchase.  So happy, that I am writing my first product review for Amazon."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Full disclosure, the first one of these I got was defective. The radio part did not work at all. However I returned it easily and the replacement worked well right out of the box. The best part is the reception. I have an inside office in a part of town where radio reception is notoriously bad, but this one, with the included antenna does better than any radio I have had here. The sound is hardly HiFi as it is one speaker, but for talk radio it is plenty good and even for music it is more than tolerable if you are not a music snob. The digital tuning and presets are the key thing I was looking for. I hate having to refind the station when I change. These set easily and now I can flip back and forth as I want to avoid commercials. For the price, you would be hard pressed to do better.\n\nLater note. I still like this radio but I have found one annoying feature: the nap button sits right next to the power and the \"band\" buttons. It is easy to hit accidentally and it then sets the radio to come on at a later time. Annoying when you intended to turn it off. I ended up putting a piece of tape over that button. No biggie I guess but annoying."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is an attractive clock radio. It has a good AM\/FM digital tuner and the sound is good for a radio this size. The display brightness is continuously adjustable down to very dim - useful  near my bed when I am sleeping. I recommend it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The main reason I decided to purchase this alarm clock was for the soothing orange color of the dimmable display.  The display can be adjust so it will not illuminate your bedroom any more than is needed.  Our previous alarm clock had an awfull blue display that would keep my wife awake at night.  Now my wife sleeps soundly and thus so do I.  I recommend ths product.  The only reason for only four stars is at this price point it would have been nice to have on screen weather or nature sounds as an option."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: For a long time I've been annoyed by the fact that I couldn't find a small and simple, quality alarm clock, that didn't look like the egg of some cycloptic space creature. If I spent more money, the clocks would only get bigger, with more useless features, like a CD player, but the quality always remained at the threshold of being utterly useless. Tuners that mix together stations and fade in and out, horrible sounding speakers etc. I know you know what I mean. Chinese crap!\n\nEnter the Sangean RCR-5. Made in California USA, this alarm clock has the solid build, classy appearance, quality sound production, and appropriate size that, to me, represents what an alarm clock should be. The five different radio station presets are easy to program and use. There's two separate buttons for two different alarm times, so if you're like my wife and have two different times to rise during the week, it's as easy as holding down the Alarm 1 or 2 buttons for 2 seconds till it beeps. BTW, some reviewers mentioned complexity in programing the clock and\/or alarms. I didn't see it. I found all the programming to be quite intuitive, and needed to glance at the instructions only briefly. My wife and I had all the features, times, and presets down within 10 minutes.\n\nThe one flaw that keeps this excellent product from having 5 stars is that if your night stand is higher than your bed, you may have a little trouble reading the numbers at night. Even from straight on our clock's numbers have a faded appearance, only darkening when your perspective changes to one that is higher than the clocks face. It's a minor thing for me, but my wife is vision-challenged without her glasses or contacts, and at night she has to strain to make out what the clock says, which wakes her up. Not a good thing. If you don't have vision problems, or your bed is even with or higher than your night stand, this shouldn't be a factor, and I highly recommend this product."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: It came in a secure package, it came in a timely manner. It was easy to understand the instructions and it has been working beautifully."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this to be a bathroom FM radio, to receive three preselected NPR stations and one preselected all classical music station. I needed the clock but not the alarm. I got what I wanted and then some.\n\nThis little radio, with no antenna augmentation, pulls in a kazillion stations with clarity. The local stations I wanted are clear and clean. Over time I\"ll explore the others.\n\nThe fidelity is adequate for my needs and what you would expect from a small plastic box.\n\nI need a high quality radio for another room; I will now consider another Sangean model."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: So, first the warnings....there is no backup battery and the display could use some improvement.\n\nThe clock has grey\/black LCD type display with an illuminated background.  So if you want a lot of contrast, you have to turn up the background brightness.  When I got it adjusted so the time was easy to read, the background was giving off so much light that it was distracting at night.  I'm keeping the background light level low so I can get to sleep, but can barely read the time at night.\n\nBut for my use, I am quite happy with this clock radio.  Small, nicely designed, a ton of useful functions, easy to use and has great sound for the size.\n\nSo, I took one star off for the display issue.  A backup battery would be nice, but it wasn't listed as a feature ... I just need to learn to read the descriptions."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: After trying several other brands in our location, and after buying a Sangeon Shower Radio (which is the absolute best), we bought this clock radio. It was the only one that has been able to sort out the many other nearby stations and noise to give us a solid, clear signal on our favorite PBS FM radio station (a relatively low power station) here in Spokane Valley, WA.  We live right below several mountain top radio\/TV antennas on one side and a few blocks from another radio tower on the other side.  We used to get nothing but noise on certain days, or multiple signals all on top of each other.  Now we have a rock solid, clear signal all the time.  The sound from the speaker is way bigger and clearer than you would expect from its size, and all the controls are easy to understand and use.  A display light adjustment on the bottom is very useful in bringing down the level of brightness during the night.  The display brightens to max if you hit any buttons, but after a short delay goes back to the setting you arranged for night display.  All in all, a great buy, even though it is not the cheapest.  You definitely get what you are paying for, and more."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I bought several of these radios -- good price, good looks, but I couldn't get a favorite station that I get on other radios in the apartment"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Love this radio!  Volumn control dial very exact.  Easy to read and tune.  Great button programing. Super for bedroom or bath.  Added feature of earphone plug in."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I love this radio.  I specifically searched for a radio with station presets, dual alarms, and a headset plug.  This radio has everything I wanted and more!  Although I wasn't specifically looking for the \"human wake\" feature, my husband and I both really appreciate it.  The reception is great too.  All my favorite stations come in loud and clear.  I fall asleep with a radio on and this radio allows me to listen to it using the sleep timer with headsets on so that I do not disturb my husband. The time for the sleep timer is also selectable.\nThe only downside to this radio is the display is a little hard to read."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a very nice radio.  The presets are easy to set, and I love the adjustable backlight on the display.  The sleep button is easy to operate.  The headphone plugin was a necessity.  The only quibble I have is that I am unable to tune in any AM stations.  This is not the fault of the radio, as we are a distance from the transmitters, and the signals are blocked because of the steel siding on our house.  Other than that, it's a great little radio!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Was happy with the ease of setup-w\/o looking at the manual!!!  Sound is so much better than the Sony it replaced and the buttons are sensitive to touch.  Hard to find this product and am very happy with the purchase."}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: After a recent purchase of the Sangean RCR-5 radio I was slightly disappointed. We have a Sangean table radio which pulls in stations great, but this radio has a hard time pulling in the same stations. I expected more from this radio because of the performance we have had with Sangean in the past. This radio just doesn't live up to the Sangean name."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I like this radio. But it has some serious ergonomic design problems.\n\nBackground. I don't sleep well and ususally wake up during the night.  I find it helpful when falling asleep to have a radio playing. I need to be able to change staions in the dark and I need an external speaker plug to attach a pillow speaker. I also need to be able to dim the display since lights interupt my sleep. I had a Sangean rcr-22 which broke after 4 years of usage. It also had problems. I wanted something better.\n\nThe rcr-5 was similar to the rcr-22 but was cheaper and did not have the \"atomic clock\" feature which never worked in New York City. I am too far from the broadcast antenna in Colorado and am near too many tall buildings that block the signal.\n\nThe rcr-5 has all the basic features I needed. The sound quality is good. The station reception is good.\nBasically it works OK for my needs. Reception seems a little better than the rcr-22. The display back light can be dimmed so it does not disturb my sleep but can still be seen in the dark. On the RCR-22 the dimmest setting for the backlight was too bright and I had to turn off the display at night.\n\nThe rcr-22 had 7 station pre-sets each for AM and FM. The rcr-5 has only 5 each. That is enough for me, but might not be enough for other people. The display on the rcr-22 had more information than the rcr-5. The rcr-22 showed the date and\/or the preset station number in addition to the time.\n\nThe real problem with the rcr-5 is the placement of the preset buttons. The top row has 9 adjacent buttons with identical feel. Starting from the left are 2 alarm set buttons. Next are the 5 preset buttons. Then the \"snooze\" button and then the power on\/off button. It is just too easy, in the middle of the night to try to change the radio station by touch and accidently to turn on or off an alarm or accidently hit the snooze button. Bad button placement. I had to put some tape over the alarm and snooze buttons so I could tell them apart from the pre-set stations by feel. The button placement was not great on the rcr-22, but the pre-sets were not next to the alarms. That means fewer accidents."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: I was really just looking for a clock radio with a digital tuner and good quality sound.  Especially at the price this was perfect for my needs.  One of the best thought out set of controls I have seen.  Nothing really negative for my needs. Quite easy to set up with minimal reading of user guide.  As others have said there is no battery backup (settings retained for 10 min max)which does not bother me but could be a killer for those making frequent use of alarm in areas with power loss problems."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I agree with all of the most positive comments made above.  This clock radio is small, compact and attractive.  The sound quality is very good and it's the easiest clock radio I have had to program."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I live about 60 miles outside of New York City.  Most radio stations are based in the city.  Reception was spotty with most alarm clock radios because of the location.  So I was searching for an alarm clock with good \"ears\" and I found it.  AM and FM reception are important to me.  The Sangean radio has been a champ.  It able to provide a good strong sound with minimal static.  The tones are good for the size of the radio.  I waited two months prior to submitting this review to make sure I knew all the aspects of this radio.  I love the ability to pick the days of the week for the alarm for each of the two alarm slots, as well as the one time alarm setting that allows you to insert a special one time alarm setting.  I am a tech type person and the navigation through alarm set up was not intuitive but it doable.  I wish the unit had a longer battery backup system.  The capacitor type only survies short dips in power, not the longer hour long interruptions that some time happen in the suburbs.  For the price I am very happy and would buy a Sangean radio again in a heart beat."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Let me tell you what I like about the Sangean RCR 5.  It has two alarms plus a separate sleep function and can be programmed for 5 FM stations and 5 AM stations.  I can go to sleep listening to AM talk radio, wake up to news on an FM station with one alarm function and then go to my favorite music station with the second alarm function - all programmed and set up in advance.  The wire antenna pulls in FM stations that other radios can't touch.  Sangean is known for AM reception, which is great.  Because it is a digital tuner, the AM does not drift and the FM stays solid.  I purchased a small computer speaker system with sub-woofer and plugged it into the earphone jack.  It makes my clock radio sound like a full stereo system.  As you can see, I'm very pleased with it.  In fact, so pleased that I bought two more for other locations."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I bought this clock radio because it had digital tuning, a feature I wanted for easily switching between two local public radio stations.  My current GE radio, vintage about 1990, picks up both stations clearly so I did not think a more technically sophisticated radio would have any trouble.  There does not seem to be any specification for reception capability from the manufacturer.\n\nHowever, when I got the new radio, the weaker of the two stations was nowhere to be heard.  The radio has a nice feature of incrementing the reception band but even the smallest could not find the station.  It did, however, find a persistent, scratchy HipHop station in the desired location.  Searching up and down the scale over several days of varying weather and various antenna positions never changed that.  I returned the radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was looking to replace my clock radio and stumbled across this.\n\nPositive feedback:\n\n#1: Has an adjustable brightness for the display\n#2: Has a head phone jack\n#3: Has a AUX IN jack (for CD, mp3 and other digital music players)\n#4: Has two programmable alarms (in case you need to get up at different times on different days of the week)\n#5: Great sound quality for AM and FM\n#6: 12 or 24 hour time display\n\nNegative feedback\n\n#1: Does not allow you to change the sleep time. (defaults to 5 minutes)\n\nAside from the non adjustable sleep time, this clock radio is well worth the money. I highly recommend it."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This clock radio fails to pick up a local station.  I have never had that problem with at least 8 other devices, including one cheapo.  Furthermore, I always set my alarms with the radio to go off first, and 5 minutes later, the buzzer.  Usually works for me.  But the buzzer begins softly, grows louder, and after one minute it stops and waits silently for a minute before beginning softly again and growing louder, then off for a minute.  I keep falling asleep between loud parts.  Also, I am used to a clock that, when I stop one alarm, the other continues.  In other words, when I turn off the second, the buzzer, the first radio alarm continues on, then turns itself off after the usual radio alarm time.  But this one stays off.  I have to manually turn it on to catch the weather and traffic, and remember to turn it off during the morning rush out the door. This last seems minor, but it is surprisingly annoying."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I purchased this alarm clock a week ago.  These are my initial impressions.\n\nRadio.  It is a great radio with a digital Tuner.  I really like the presets.  I listen to my baseball team on AM radio in the evening and my FM Morning show.  It is so easy to switch back and forth between these two.  That is just awesome.  However the radio will not blow you away, but I mainly use this radio for talk shows and it is perfect for that.\n\nClock.\nThis is probably the weakest area of the radio.  It would be awesome if the radio had an auto dimmer for night.  The great thing is that you can dim this alarm clock as much as you want so that it doesn't disturb your sleep.  Some clock radios just have 3 settings uber-bright, super-bright, and bright.  Then where the weakness comes in is that when it's dim the alarm clock is pretty much unreadable during the day.\n\nAlarm.\nThe alarm seems fine.  It is different than my last radio. It is a little hard to use, but not impossible.  I like the gradually louder beeping.\n\nAUX IN\/Headphone\nThese 2 settings are great.  It adds to the flexibility of the radio.  If I wanted to bring it to work, or put on headset at night, or listen to my ipod it could do all of these things.  GREAT.\n\nOverall it is a great clock radio.  I never rock out with my clock radio.  I have much nicer equipment in the house for that.  The misses clock radio is visible during the day.  I really like the 5 presets on both AM\/FM.  In two seconds I can switch between stations, or AM\/FM.  This is exactly what I wanted."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: Loved it when I first got it, but since then I've noticed the station tuning (supposedly digital) wanders, and there's nothing I can do about it, since each station is set where it's supposed to be. I love the digital push buttons to go to different stations, and that's why I bought this item.\n\nThe included antenna is woefully inadequate, and there's no external metal part to attach a real antenna to.\n\nWorst of all, the audio quality is very low fi. Disappointingly so. I'm considering jig-sawing into the box and connecting a decent Radio Shack bookshelf speaker, though I'm not sure where I'd put it. I liked that it all fits on my night table. I never use it as an alarm clock.\n\nVery disappointed."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This was a gift for someone who wanted a small clock-radio with digital preset buttons.  It works well and looks great!  The manual with it was written by someone not very familiar with our English language, but it is passable. This clock-radio has many practical features not found on those in local stores. It is well-worth the money."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I use this in my office and it picks up radio, both AM and FM very good.  I needed two things, good reception and a audio out jack for my external speakers (yes this has its own speaker, but I wanted to use others) this does both."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great little radio.  Was looking for small radio with presets and audio out jack for headphones and worked as advertised.  I would recommend it.  Wire antenna needs adjustment to get some stations."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: We researched clock radios for a long time before purchasing this one. We are very pleased with the ease of use and the sound quality of this radio."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: This is an attractive item with extraordinary sound quality. Yet,I have to repress the urge to take a sledge hammer to it nearly every time I try to set the alarm.\n\nThere is nothing intuitive about the design. The cool-looking buttons are small and give one little indication what each one is for. I have to pull out the manual and refresh my memory every time I want to set it. If you wear glasses or contacts forget it.\n\nThe benefits of the sound system, along with the features, not to mention the sleek design, are a waste of money if you actually plan to use this item to wake up.\n\nAnother Sangean product we own has a similar problem. Hey Sangean, if you're listening: Keep having your techies build quality components; but have a normal person who actually needs to wake up in the morning help design the settings.\n\nFS (using my wife's account)"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I purchased this clock radio at Christmas time for my wife and I. I have returned it because we can not see it at night, or in the early morning.  Part of this is due to where we place it, atop a high cabinet past the foot of our bed.  The screen of this unit is not easily seen from below horizontal. But, even when I propped up the back, we could not make out the time from in bed. There is not enough contrast difference between the digits and the background.  This unit might work okay from a nearby nightstand.\nThe radio portion worked really well. I selected this unit based on review comments on the radio, and it lived up to expectation.  Our favorite station is a bit weak and is right between two more powerful ones.  This radio did great at pulling in our station and staying on it.  I did need to change a setting in order to make minor adjustments to the frequency.\nSetting and using the alarm is a bit strange, although the instructions do provide the details.  They are just not intuitive. So, while everything worked out fine while I had instructions in-hand, when the alarm went off, it was frustration time. The sleep-snooze button is large, and well placed. But, the alarm shutoff is a small button near the back. If one hits the sleep button first, then it seems difficult (read as never figured it out) to shut that alarm off.\nProbably would have kept the alarm if we could have seen the time.  I expect we would have learned how to use the functions correctly."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: The radio seems real nice except you cant read the time unless you are directly in line with the display.  Unfortunately I cant use it for an alarm clock because of this issue.  Otherwise it seems like it is a quality build that is fairly easy to use thew controls on.  I like the digital tuning and analog volume control."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am beyond pleased with this clock radio --- quite literally the best one I have ever had.\nHave tried (and given away) one after another;  now, at long last, this little radio does it all.\n\nThe one thing I was particularly looking for was reception: living in the mountains, our radio reception\nis less than optimal.  With various radios throughout the house, with fair to less-than-fair\nreception, this one is wonderful!!!  Good sound quality ( from this little box) - never-fading reception -\nwow!\nLove the easily managed display - the yellow is easy on the eyes, unlike the rather awful BRIGHT blue of others I\nhave tried.\nCannot recommend this one highly enough!!"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I looked around for a while trying to find a clock radio with all the features I was looking for without breaking the bank. This one comes oh so close to being exactly what I wanted. The main attributes I was looking for was a digital tuner, an adjustable back light, and individual button presets. This unit has all these and more. Everything else is super easy to use and well thought out. Multiple settings for the alarm (everyday, weekdays, weekends, once). The soft amber light of the back light is perfect. I can easily see the time without lighting up the room at all. The only minuses are limited battery back up (built in battery only last 10 minutes in an outage), no station scan for the tuner, and a relatively weak antenna. There were a couple of weaker stations in Sacramento I was hoping to get but don't. All in all I am quite pleased with the purchase and will be keeping it."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I really like most of the features of this clock radio except the HWS (humane wake system). As time progress I have found that I have tended to sleep 15-45 minutes past the alarm time. Being such a heavy sleeper, I have noticed a tendency to incorporate the alarm into my dreams or just ignore it. I think they should have the ability to disable the HWS and have the alarm adjustable."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I bought this clock radio having read previous buyers' pros and cons. I found that the \"cons\" did not add up to much. Yes, the manual is not well written, but it does cover the necessary basics to get going with this device. I still find myself fumbling a bit in the mornings as my fingers learn the landscape of buttons that are new to my touch. But I have faith that I'll get there. What I especially like about this clock\/radio are the available features for setting the alarm(s). I really like having two alarms and use them both. I feel like this represents money well spent."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was looking for a small, AM\/FM clock radio for the nightstand - I didn't need any kind of ipod dock, CD player, external speakers, etc - but it HAD to have an earphone jack (for listening to late night talk radio) and adjustable display brightness; and it had to run on AC (no batteries) and not take up half the nightstand; also I was hoping for under $50. This combination of features (or non-features) was actually hard to fine, and the Sangean turned out to be it. I was a bit reluctant to order this at first due to some of the negative comments on reception, but I get perfect reception on both AM & FM. Also, the controls are very intuitive and easy to learn and use - no 50 page instruction manual required. I rated sound at 3 stars, but it is acceptable for its size, and I use Skull Candy headphones anyway Skull Candy Chrome (also very good product). Great radio, came in original packaging in 4 days with super saver savings."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: After spending hours upon hours looking for an attractive dual alarm clock radio, I stumbled upon this Sangean one. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing (pictures do not do it justice - it has a very simple, mid-century look to it) - but it is incredibly easy to set and use. I cannot tell you how pleased we are with this clock. With the endless amount of junk out there - in ugly silver and techy designs, this Sangean is a refreshing change. (NOTE: I never ever take the time to write product reviews but had to make an exception for this!)."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I was concerned by some of the reviews so I was on edge when it was delivered. I was pleasently surprised. If you can handle the functions on a cell phone, you can handle this. Remember, this is a clock radio. Not a Hi-Fi stereo and doesn't make your coffee. But no more using that little wheel to find stations. Its digital and has preset. Nap function is awsome and the alarm starts out soft and slowly rises till you wake up. Not the instant airhorn that can put you into cardiac arrest. It is the most I have ever spent on a clock radio, but I think you will find the many features are worth it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Boy, did I want a clock radio with presets.  And on that dimension, this product satisfies.  However, it has three key shortcomings that bother me:\n\n1.  The reception -- in my case -- is no better than the old analog tuner clock\/radio it replaced.\n\n2.  The on\/off switch is unreliable.  I'd say two times in three I have to hit it twice to get it to perform.  This applies for both ON and OFF.\n\n3.  The alarm set feature beeps!  Perhaps there's a way to disable this, but I haven't found it.  This is really annoying -- empirical testing shows that the beep is loud enough to wake my sleeping wife.  So if she's asleep, and I need to change the alarm time, I resort to my watch alarm.  I'd love to hear what the design engineers were thinking when they programmed this feature, because the merit of the beep is truly lost on me.\n\nOn the plus side, the unit is attractive.  The aforementioned presets are wonderful (and should be emulated by other manufacturers).  And the numbers are big enough \/ bright enough for my very near-sighted eyes to see in the night.\n\nI'm not junking it.  But if I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't buy this alarm."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: All the functions you need for a clock radio.\n5 presets for stations\neasy to use functions with well written instructions\nbest radio for the money"}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I looked high and low for the right alarm clock -the radio was a bonus.  It's so hard to find an alarm with a tolerable alarm sound, which was the highest priority on my list and Sangean has the Humane Wake System alarm.  It slowly wakes you with a soft pleasant sound that doesn't terrify you out of your sleep.  After all, who wants to wake up with a speeding heart rate to start your day.  You would think that the manufacturers would allow you to actually hear a sound bite sample of the alarm on their sites- hard to believe, but maybe some people don't find it as vitally important as I do.\nOther than that, the radio has great sound.  It's easy to use, top quality and has a really nice aesthetic.  I also wanted a white clock as opposed to the typical black or silver.\nVery happy with this purchase!"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Sangean RCR-5 Digital could not even turn it on. If I had not ordered from this seller before I would not order from them again. Sent damaged radio."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: For its size, it also has a truly fine sound quality, not at all tinny or cheap sounding. But the reception is weak for FM stations. I get most, but not all the stations clearly that I desired for preset programming. I use the radio in the bathroom, so I do not need all the other features. I also love the size of this unit. It fits perfectly on the shelf and that is the reason that I bout it."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Lots of good features but I have one problem. I recently had a power outage at 2:00 PM and did not know about it until I returned home that night at 7:00 PM. I manually had the clock re-synch (it was 20 minutes slow)and all was well the next morning. However, this brought up a shortcoming of the product. If I hadn't re-synched it, my assumption is that it re-synchs every day at 3:00 A.M. and I would have been awakened at my normal time (the clock did remember my alarm settings). But this brings us the question - what if the outage occurs after 3:00 AM and lasts for 20 minutes. Will I be awakened 20 minutes later than I wanted? Something to consider when considering this product."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I was on the market for a nice looking alarm that did two things: look good and offer a gradual wake up system. This alarm does both. The aux input is nice but who would listen to music through a clock radio? The speaker is not that wonderful and the radio range is pretty sucky. These are things I don't care about though. All in all, for what it does I think this is way over priced. It should cost 30$ max. Just because it looks better than most alarms, Sangean feels that they can charge 40$. If you have the money and really want the looks then go for it."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I purchased this item partly because of its ability to dim the display - which is great.\n\nHowever, I also purchased it for the radio and I can't get any of my normal public radio stations--I don't usually have a hard time receiving stations.\n\nI just can't believe that some of these reviewers say that this thing has great reception!\n\nI live in Boston - so, as another reviewer said - if you live in an area with a lot of stations - you'll have a hard time getting some of the smaller stations. One I get but can hear another station crossed over with it - and others just don't come in.\n\nAnd we don't usually have trouble getting reception where I live...\n\nI am going to return this item."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: I love the features of this radio.\nReasonable price for a radio with digital pre-sets.\nNice nap feature.\nHOWEVER...I've had it 3 months and the AM band has stopped receiving stations, all STATIC..very disappointing."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Quote from another review:  \"HOWEVER...I've had it 3 months and the AM band has stopped receiving stations, all STATIC..very disappointing.\"\n\nThe EXACT same thing happened to my radio - buyer beware!!"}
{"review":"This is a neutral review: I own the Sangean portable model 220A and enjoy using it. I could not wait for the RCR 5. I was extremely disappointed. The portable pulled in more AM and FM stations with less interefence. Had to return the radio."}
{"review":"This is a negative review: Looks good, reception is OK and sound is pleasant, but controls are illogical and difficult to distinguish - the preset stations look like and are in the same line with the alarm and power buttons. Setting the alarms is complicated and requires re-reference to the manual."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: The radio meets my expecttions.  It has good sound and reception.  I expected it to be larger so the size was a plus.  Overall i am satisfied and would recommend it to others"}
{"review":"This is a negative review: I bought this because I wanted a clock radio that would have good AM reception.  The reception is average - no better than less expensive clock radios.  The sound quality was very poor.  I have bought the Sangean DT 220V pocket radio which has greater sound and reception, and expected that from this radio so was disappointed."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was looking for a clock radio with a digital radio tuner.  This unit is simple and easy to use.  I like the dimmer feature for the display to save energy and cut down on nightime \"glow\".  There are plenty of preset stations so my husband and I can easily access all or our favorite music."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I got this to replace a 30-year old GE 7-4870 \"Great Awakening\" which finally died after close to 30 years of use. The radio is much smaller obviously and has decent ergonomics. No problem setting the time and alarms, no manual needed. The sound quality is pretty decent, AM reception is usable, though not as sensitive as the old 4870, and is susceptible to overload from strong stations. This seems to be the weakest part, the radio has no selectivity and overloads from strong stations. FM is HORRIBLE if you live in an area blanketed with strong FM stations, which I do just outside of Atlanta. You can try bunching up the little FM wire antenna and this will sometimes make reception better. This radio could not pickup 92.9 Dave FM due to the overload without placing the cord in one position. Even cheap $9 Walkman radios have no trouble- a simple LOCAL\/DX attenuator switch would fix this, what were you thinking Sangean? Otherwise it's a perfect clock radio, I guess it would be if I lived further out. Meanwhile, I'm scouting Ebay for another GE 7-4870, 4880 or 4885..."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I am pleased with this attractive clock radio. I wanted a light-colored clock radio, and so many in the stores are black or silver. Because it is not very big, it does not take up a lot of space on my nightstand. Right now, I gave it 4 stars for ease of use, but as I get used to operating the 2 alarm systems, I know it will become second nature to me. I like the Human Wake System. It is nice to have the buzzer alarm slowly increase in volume instead of loudly blasting at the set time. As for the sound quality, I live in a rural area, so no radio has great reception which affects the sound, but it sounds fine, and I can listen to the news as I get dressed in the morning."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF STYLES AND MODELS OF CLOCK RADIOS OUT THERE WITH MIXTURES OF PRICES AND FEATURES GALORE. I WANTED ONE WITH AN EARPLUG JACK TO LISTEN TO NEWS, SPORTS, ETC WITHOUT WAKING THE SPOUSE WHILE SHE SLEPT. THAT ELIMINATED 95% OF ALL MODELS OUT THERE. I DID NOT NEED ATOMIC TIMING, CD PLAYER, iPOD PLAYER, TV OR WEATHER RADIO EITHER. THIS MODEL HAD GOOD REVIEWS ON AMAZON AND WAS REASONABLY PRICED. WENT FOR IT AND GOT A GOOD DEAL! ADJUSTABLE LIGHT, DIGITAL TUNING AND 10 PRESETS, TWO ALARMS AND THE ONE WITH THE PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER CHIRP IS VERY NICE VS. LOUD BUZZERS! GOOD QUALITY FEEL TO THE SET AND CONTROLS. CAME WELL PACKAGED. THE MANUAL IS JUST ADEQUATE FOR SETTING UP THE FIRST TIME. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT ALL THE BUTTONS ON TOP ARE ROUND AND IDENTICAL TO THE TOUCH. JUST THE POWER BUTTON HAS A RED LIGHT TO INDICATE ON\/OFF. TO FEEL IN THE DARK FOR A STATION OR TURN OFF THE ALARM ETC, IS DIFFICULT. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE A GREEN LIGHT UNDER THE STATION PRESETS, A YELLOW LIGHT FOR THE ALARM BUTTONS TO INDICATE ON\/OFF AND WHICH ONE, AND ANOTHER LIGHT, SAY IN BLUE, THAT BY BEING HI\/LOW INDICATES AM\/FM. IF NOT LIGHTS, THEN DIFFERENT SHAPED BUTTONS LIKE SQUARES, TRIANGLES,& RECTANGLES MIGHT BE USED TO FEEL IN THE DARK OF NIGHT TO TURN ON\/OFF, SELECT STATIONS ETC. OVERALL, A VERY GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I read the description of the radio, including the measurements; even so, the radio is smaller than I expected.  I thought I would be able to set everything up without the manual, but after a brief reading of the time and alarm settings, setting it was not difficult.  Setting or changing the alarm will require numerous steps, but is not difficult.  The display is pleasing and easily read from a distance or up close.  It is not the usual green or blue.  The sound is amazing for the size of the radio.  I was a little disappointed at the large size of the electrical cord at the outlet, but considering the sound quality, oh well!  I have heard the alarm or wake up to radio features yet, but that will probably be just fine considering the quality of the radio sound.  I am pleased with the purchase.  It is difficult to find an AM\/FM clock radio without the Ipod.  I also wanted a radio that was easy to change stations.  I would like a remote but that is not to be expected at this price.  I have previously used a Bose Wave radio with remote for my alarm, but its AM reception is not the quality of this radio.  The FM reception is generally the same as the Bose except for my favorite station.  Improving FM reception will require some adjustment of the antennae wire.  This is an amazing little radio with excellent features and sound quality including reception for the price.\n\nI am no longer using the radio.  My cat chewed the thin electrical cord.  Drat.  I did like the radio.  Now am using a Bose Wave Radio ... I guess its sound was better than the Sangean, but a few stations have a little static which is usually solved by moving the radio just a little."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I really like this radio, which fits nicely on my night table.  I use it mainly to listen to talk programs and the quality of the sound is fine for that. I do wish it picked up more stations clearly but the ones I listen to regularly come in well and at night I can pull in ones 500 miles away. Perhaps I'm easy to please as I've always had cheap radios and this one is much better. I like the sleek, low look and have found it easy to memorize which button does what so I can make adjustments in the dark."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Highly recommended.  Agree with all positive reviews.  HWS alarm works with headphones plugged in.  Radio alarm does not over-ride the headphones when plugged in.  I love falling asleep to talk radio on the headphones while my wife sleeps in peace...and I have the peace of mind knowing the HWS alarm will sound in the morning."}
{"review":"This is a positive review: Based on reviews by others I had hoped this little radio would satisfy my needs for good AM and FM reception with decent sound.  Sound was tinny but using a set of computer speakers offset that issue.  Reception very spotty for both both AM and FM stations and the little wire antenna didn't help much.  Didn't appear to be any way to boost reception by attaching another antenna.  Since the product didn't live up to expectations, I tried to return it, but was refused.  I didn't retain the plastic bags covering the radio and plug in the box and the box had a couple of tears so the package wasn't in pristine condition.  No damages, scars, etc. to the radio itself so sounds to me like supplier won't accept returns once you open their box which implies a no return policy.  If I had bought this locally at Wal-Mart or Target or about any other store, a return would have been accepted."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I was never able to get a really good reception.  I had to keep moving the antenna and the placement.  It was obvious that it would not receive good enough to enjoy.  I returned it, and I must say that it was a very easy return.  I recommend Amazon highly for the ease of returning an item that is not satisfactory."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Great, well-made clock radio - external antenna brings in stations even in my valley location.  This radio was an upgrade from a ~10-year-old Sony Dream Machine, and it feels to me like driving a brand new BMW after having had $2000 junker cars all my life.  This radio had just what I was looking for in terms of digital tuning and programmable options, encased in a quality-feeling case.  I like the dimmable display, and keep it on a very low brightness setting.  On the downside, you do need to read the manual to set the alarm.  OK once you get the hang of it, but still complicated. Were I to live in an area with longer power outages, I would like a longer battery backup.\n\nI had never heard of Sangean before.  Based on this experience, I will highly consider Sangean products in the future.  As long as you are OK with the complex alarm settings, this clock radio is definitely worth spending $40 vs. $25-30 for a similar Sony."}
{"review":"This is a very negative review: This is a terrific clock radio despite a couple of drawbacks for insomniac listening (knocking 1 star off the rating).  Features I require in a clock radio (beyond the obvious) are: earphone jack (my husband isn't interested in listening along with me ;), sleep timer, digital tuning (having to fiddle with station drift would only serve to wake me up more); preset stations (again, the less fiddling in the middle of the night, the better); and dimable display (I keep it just bright enough to read the display at night--this is pretty dim, doesn't disturb sleep).  This radio has all that and more; I also like the small size of the radio and amber light of the display.\n\nThat said, here's what I dislike:  when you press and hold the power-on button to use the sleep timer, the display becomes painfully bright, \"only\" about 15 seconds, but I find it extremely annoying. I'm working on developing a feel for how long to hold the button down without having to look at the display so I can just keep my eyes closed.\n\nThe other thing I dislike: the nap timer button is right next to the power-on\/sleep timer button, making it very easy to accidentally hit the nap timer button without realizing it while feeling around for the power button, thus treating yourself and any sleep partner to the alarm a little while later.  Ugh.  Did that twice, then built a little \"A-frame\" of card stock & taped it over the nap timer button so I don't hit it by accident again.  Note the power\/sleep timer button *is* dimly (nicely) illuminated, so the nap timer button can be avoided if you don't mind opening your eyes, lifting your head up to see the power button, and focusing your attention on hitting nothing but the power button.\n\nIt's too bad the battery backup isn't good for more than a few minutes; hopefully this won't prove to be a significant problem.  I didn't find setting the clock, alarms, or digital presets difficult, though I did need to use the manual to figure it out."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: I replaced my $10 GE clock radio with the Sangean RCR-5 because the $10 radio often could not pull in my favorite NPR station in the morning. The Sangean, with the attached arial wire, does that just fine and has a much better quality speaker. However, with its 6 volt LCD time display it is difficult to read the time from across the room, which was never a problem witn the 110 volt LED display on the $10 radio. Turning up the backlight on the display to compensate creates an annoyance at night, unless you want a bright night light. An automatic dimmer would have been nice. I should also add that the unimaginative design with very small buttons is not as functional or as attractive as the $10 GE radio. It also does not provide for an external battery to keep the clock running in the event of an overnight power failure. The interal battery is stated to only accomodate power interuptions of up to ten minutes. But at least the on\/off button is lighted, if you can open your eyes. The bottom line is that I'll keep it for the quality reception and sound, but it should be better designed for its purpose as an alarm clock."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: This is a fabulous product. Well designed and stylish, the sound is fantastic for such a small and inexpensive unit, and it's very simple. I do not find setting the alarms to be at all complicated compared to other clock radios. A joy to own and operate. This was not my first clock radio purchase, but it will definitely be my last for some time. Highly recommended."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: Plusses:\n1) Sound quality is pretty good. You won't mistake it for even a set of dedicated mini-speakers, but it's always good enough. (Unlike, say, the mesmerisingly bad&nbsp;.)\n2) It feels like a quality device.\n3) It has an astonishing range of features: nap timers, crazy customizable alarm settings, etc. I enjoy playing with it.\n\nMinuses:\n1) It looks OK. But with slightly different typefaces and plastic finishes, this could be a really classy-looking item.\n2) The UI is cryptic. Way, way too hard to use. I actually had to read the manual. For an alarm clock. Seriously.\n3) The power cord and (separate) antenna come out of the back, but the line-in is on the right side of the unit. Looks sloppy.\n\nSo what you've got here is the engineer's alarm clock: not enough attention paid to aesthetics or usability, but the functionality and build quality are outta sight.\n\nLuckily for me, I'm an engineer."}
{"review":"This is a very positive review: \n\n  The Sangean RCR-5 clock radio is very well designed. The feature I like best is the convenient station selection-from among 5 pre-stored stations in each of the 2 bands (AM & FM). This feature may appear obvious, but it was very hard to find a clock\/radio with this capability. It is also very user friendly as far as making the clock and alarm settings. Beside its functionality, its design is attractive-and it is the perfect size (i.e., neither too large nor too small)."}
